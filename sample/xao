m such a huge fan. I did not see this movie when it came out in 1994. I did not become aware of it for sometime after that. I was not a Tarantino fan, so I went into this movie with a completely open mind. What I saw over the course of the film was not only mind blowing, but I would go as far as to say life-altering. The way the scenes are shot, the use of music, and the incredible dialogue and mastery of the human language sets this movie apart on a level with the classics. On top of the wonderful cinematography, the acting is superb as well. Seeing people like Sam Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames in a film before becoming superstars shows the brilliance of the casting.<br /><br />If you are not offended my violence and profanity, I would recommend you buy this film immediately as you will want to watch it over and over to appreciate all of the nuances of this modern day masterpiece.

This by far is the best documentary I have ever seen about silent films.  Every aspect of film making was covered and there are wonderful interviews with movie stars and film makers of the era.  It is high time for this series to be made available on DVD. This series should not become a forgotten gem.

 | product/productId: 0783236530 | review/userId: A22RY8N8CNDF3A | review/summary: Serious and Funny - | review/text: Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence team up for a prison comedy underlined by serious social commentary - wasted lives. Ray Murphy, a pick-pocket and con man, and Claude Lawrence), a straight-living bank teller, are complete opposites who cross paths in a 1932 Harlem nightclub. In order to pay off their debts to a local crime lord, the mismatched pair travel into the Deep South on a moonshine delivery only to be framed for murder by a racist Southern cop. Sentenced to life in a Mississippi state prison, the bickering duo spend the next 65 years trading barbs and planning their escape, while forming an unlikely but touching friendship. They finally escape substituting dead bodies for their own in a arson-fire - and end the movie together watching a Yankees game together. There are a few good laughs, but it's not what one would expect from the two comedians - it's more a friendship movie that develops over time.

I think I probably saw it first around the age of 5 or 6. I'm 19 years old now. This is one of my favorite movies. I love the music and the atmosphere of this film. It's one of those movies you can just sit down on a quiet day and watch. I probably watched it over a million times. Morgan Freeman, Jessica Tandy, & Dan Aykroyd are some of my favorite actors. This is just an age old southern classic that I think I'll cherish forever. If you like nice southern movies I think you'll like this movie just as much as I do.

 | product/productId: 0783233078 | review/userId: A1QZHBH1SRBBSE | review/summary: One of the best movies from the eightes!! | review/text: FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH is one of the best movies of the eightes. The movie is based off of Cameron Crowe's book "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", Crowe went undercover as a student at Clairmont high school for a year. This movie started careers for Forest Whitaker, Nicholas Coppola [Nicholas Cage], Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Edwards, and Sean Penn. This movie is a all time classic. The soundtrack is great. My favorite character is Jeff Spicoli.Their was a kind-of a sequel made 2 years later called "THE WILD LIFE", none of the orignal cast where in it except Eric Stolz, Chris Penn is in it too.  I recommend this movie if you like Cameron Crowe's work or if you like movies from the 80's. Hey Bud, Lets Party!

 | product/productId: 0310329795 | review/userId: A1W34HXGKKAINP | review/summary: insulting book | review/text: The positive of this book is it was written and the message is good.<br /><br />The negative is the absurdity of the dichotomy of the title and seeing Groeschel refer to himself and "Christian Atheists" like him over and over again. The references are obvious that Groeschel was attempting to shock believers who do not live their life as followers of Christ.<br /><br />This is not a deep, philosophical work to consider and does not relate to either questioning the existence of God or agnostic wondering. I found it insulting when it quickly became obvious that Groeschel coined the title term a "Christian Atheist" to describe a gnostic believer of God to dive deep into living life as a Christian.<br /><br />The intent to expand people in their walk with God is good. The approach Groeschel took comparing gnosticism with atheism was silly and insulting. The 1973 book "The Christian, the Atheist, and Freedom" by Joseph A. Magno and Victor S. La Motte also has a definition that a christian atheist is one who has the belief that Christ died on the cross but was not resurrected.<br />There are many other books that challenge believers to have a deeper, Christ filled life that do not insult cognitive readers and critical thinkers.

This set of DVDs is a wonderful reference companion for the art history major and a treasure for the artist and the art connoiseur. It is my most valued DVD. <p>Portrayed are masterpieces that were hidden from the eyes of Westerners for centuries. The precious disks reveal beautiful video images of art specimens never published in our Western art history books.  The video allows the viewer to pause and zoom throughout the entire presentation, although the camera scan of the images and the selected angle shots are perfect without using this unique feature. <p>Disk one commences with an interesting historical presentation of Russia in the Age of Peter the Great followed with episodes of art and art history through the 14th century.  Disk two commences with an exciting description of the museum's architecture followed with episodes and chapters of art and history from the 15th century to the 20th century.<p>The educational content in this film is beyond any documentary film of art I have seen, the historical implication is outstanding, it is a delightful tour of the world's great art collections.

When it reached our theatre, I got to see it a number of times.  I found it extremely disturbing and utterly unforgettable.  It creates a dream-like atmosphere that ultimately turns into a nightmare.  Films that show the seamy side of Hollywood have always fascinated me.  "Locust" is like watching a traffic accident.  You are revolted but you can't look away.  I'll admit this film isn't for everyone.  That said, it is still a stunning piece of work.  Kudos to all involved.

Needless<br />to say, I was disappointed. Lisa Zane stars as a social worker who tries to help a mysterious boy with an apparent case of amnesia. Trying to figure out who he is, the two, along with three stowaways in the shelter van, wind up in Springwood. The hometown of Freddy. There, Freddy preys on the newcomers because all of the teens in town are dead!. Interesting revelations come out concerning Freddy and the shelter worker. The effects are really good. That's always a strong point in every Elm Street movie. The acting is routine, with the exception of the always fabulous Robert Englund as Freddy. Alice Cooper playing Freddy's father in a flashback was inspired casting. That's the one great thing you can say about this movie. The background and all the details of Freddy's life. That's a major plus. That can't be said for the rest of the bland, boring film. The end fight scene is okay tho. Not one of the best.

(It doesn't hurt if you like Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas either.) This movie is fun from the very beginning, as Zorro flies through the air in the eyes of a young peasant boy. Beautifully crafted action sequences with the right touch of romance and a good helping of comedy make this hard to beat. (The only one I can think of is its successor, the Legend of Zorro.) Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, Antonio Banderas is funny, charming and heroic altogether, and Catherine Zeta-Jones isn't as innocent as you'd expect. Enjoy!

 | product/productId: 0310256003 | review/userId: A3I7AJCVNKE7ME | review/summary: Excellent series for group study!!! | review/text: Our small church (20 - 30 who regularly attend church) had 12 participants in adult Sunday School when we did this series.  This was the first adult Sunday School curriculem we had used in 10 years, and is still the favorite of all that we've done since.  It can be used with new Christians, or those who have done years of Bible study.  Even my eight-year-old wanted to watch the videos (available from Focus on the Family) with us(although some videos are not appropriate for children).  The videos are excellent.  The Leaders' Guide is awesome.  Wonderful insights into God's love and our response from little-known parts of the Bible, made relevent by modern-day archeaology.  I would recommend this series whole-heartedly to any church or group wanting to study the Bible.

Olivia came from Australia and won the hearts of music fans. "You're The One That I Want" is the hot number here. The pair dress in black. "Tell me about it, stud!" Grease appeals to successive generations. Male/female duos perform Summer Nights to karaoke tracks. The film exaggerates. There were no T-Birds or Pink Ladies where I was from. The cast of Grease was long since out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 35.
 | product/productId: 0792175263 | review/userId: A1AXHNRDJEQ0B | review/summary: Great teen movie | review/text: While the plot is predictable, the acting is superb, and the script itself has many small nuances that make the movie worthwhile.<p>The heart of the story isn't dance, or kids' dreams, but the relationship between Derek and Sarah. Unlike many other black / white relationship movies (where the black character moves into a white environment, and we get the white environment's objections to the relationship), this movie shows us the black environment's point of view. Sarah has to adjust to a mostly black environment, for instance. We also get to hear why many black girls won't like seeing one of their 'best guys' dating a white girl. We do get to experience this movie from a completely unexpected point of view!<p>The movie itself (while still containing many cliches) has a very important social message besides being fun to watch.
 | product/productId: 6301006798 | review/userId: A2QEKSDSU5F8Y5 | review/summary: &quot;less than zero&quot;---that's how I rate it! | review/text: Bret Easton Ellis' contemporary classic about the spiritual lacking of LA youth is transformed into the biggest &quot;Just Say No&quot; public service announcement.  Characters are taken from the book while the plot is thrown away for an entirely different one!<p>In this bastardization, Clay (Andrew McCarthy, in a very wooden performance) comes back from college to rekindle with his old girlfriend Blair (Jami Gertz) and together they try to save their drug-addict pal Julien (Robert Downey Jr.) from the evil dope dealer Rip (James Spader).<p>First of all, in the movie Clay is all sqeaky clean and compassionate; in the book, he does coke and seems pretty detached.  Second, in the the book Julien doesn't really appear until near the end.  Third, the character of Rip is one of Clay's friends in the orignal novel! Did the director actually read the book?<p>Only Downey's performace (perhaps a little too good?) makes this film worth seeing.  Some movies are so bad that you can't help but liking them--this movie just blows!
 | product/productId: 630204927X | review/userId: A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8 | review/summary: Profound and inspiring!  A wonderful Civil War saga! | review/text: This is a powerful and inspirational film dealing with a truly great Civil War story.  The 54th Mass. Volunteers was the first uniformed black regiment to fight in the Civil War.  The story here is wonderfully told, and the film pulls no punches about the prejudice and adversity that the soldiers of the 54th had to endure in order to get what white soldiers took for granted--acceptance by the rest of the Army as the fighting men that they were.<br /><br />The 54th was officered by white soldiers, and here Matthew Broderick puts in a fine performance as the Colonel of the regiment.  His eventual bonding with the men, and the mutual respect that gradually develops as the regiment congeals into a well-trained fighting force, is wonderfully done and quite inspirational.  Morgan Freeman does his customary stellar job as the regimental Sergeant Major, to whom the Colonel comes to look for insights about leadership and the problems of the men.  Denzel Washington (disclosure: this is one of my favorite actors) plays a signficant role as Private Trip, who enlists out of pride and the desire to prove he is the equal of anyone.  Trip refuses to accept the lesser pay afforded to black soldiers. White soldiers were paid $13/month, black soldiers $10.  It is a historical fact that many black soldiers refused to accept the $10, or any pay at all, until Congress eventually corrected this outrage.  The rest of the cast was quite good as well.<br /><br />The battle scenes in this film are incredibly good--in my opinion this sets the standard for how a battle should be done in a film.  The action never takes precedence over the plot, but I was quite literally absorbed by the intensity and the drama of both the first skirmish in which the regiment is blooded, and the later major assault in which the regiment is given the (nearly suicidal) lead position.<br /><br />This is a big budget film, and deserves every one of its five stars.  It features an inspiring story, excellent acting, lots of action, and realistic sets and battles.  What more can one ask?  This is one to which the discerning viewer will return many times.
 | product/productId: 0792845862 | review/userId: A2I2DE1DJUVQOO | review/summary: Great movie, and they sure don't make women and men like these anymore | review/text: This is a great movie that has held up really well over time.  At the time, it dealt very honestly and realistically with issues of war veterans returning home, and the adjustments their families and relatives have to make.  There is the war veteran who returns home with hooks for his hands, there is mention of PTSD, of the inevitable divorces, of difficulty finding work in the postwar economy.<br /><br />But what makes this such a great movie is that it is a story of love and hope.<br /><br />There are three love stories in this movie, all in different stages of evolution.<br /><br />One is a long standing established marriage - the Myrna Loy and Fredric March characters are a  middle aged couple who thoroughly understand and still deeply love one another.  They fit together like spoons in a drawer.  Dare we use the word soulmates here?<br /><br />In the characters of Harold Russell, the real-life injured veteran, and his girlfriend, played by Cathy O'Donnell, is the classic relationship of the girl-next-door, childhood sweetheart.  Russell, the only non-professional actor, is a bit stiff and awkward in his relationship with his girlfriend, and one senses a lack of chemistry here, despite the beautiful Cathy O'Donnell's best efforts at playing the dutiful and faithful girlfriend.  Russell did win two Oscars for this role, the only time that has happened in Oscar history.<br /><br />The best love story is that of the characters of Dana Andrews and the lovely Theresa Wright.  First, though, the Dana Andrews character, coming from a humble background, loses his gold digger wife, who divorces him after he loses his job.  Wright's character is thoroughly well-bred, independant, and intelligent, having been raised in comfortable upper-middle class surroundings.  One senses that in today's world she would have almost certainly entered college and a career of some sort.<br /><br />The movie ends on a wonderful shot - as they hug and kiss, Dana Andrews telling Theresa Wright: "You'll know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?  It may take us years to get anywhere.  We'll have no money, no decent place to live.  We'll have to work, get kicked around"<br /><br />His words only bring out a glowing smile from Theresa Wright, as she understands this to mean that he loves her and they will be doing this struggle in life together henceforth...<br /><br />Yep, they sure don't make women and men like that anymore.

After all it opens with a shot of a book clearly written in Italian that is followed by a close up of the same book only this time in English.Dogdy. But as soon  as the extremely infectious theme tune kicks in you know where you are.  Cheese town. The main character Peter Neil , a writer whose thrillers are  the inspiration for a series of murders, somehow makes you think that  William Shatner somewhat under played Captain Kirk! There is so much to  enjoy here :red herrings,bad clothes,gory murders,some extremely unnerving  moments,hilarious bit parts(Johnny the PA is Fred from Scooby Doo made  flesh!)and the sense that the director is trying to send you mad guessing  who the murderer is.The whodunnit feel gives the impression this is what a  modern Agatha Christie novel would be like.....if Miss Marple were to get  an axe in the back come finale time.

 | product/productId: 6301977416 | review/userId: A2B73CL3QSYWLB | review/summary: Roundtree Shines in Landmark Role | review/text: The private eye, the mainstay of American cinema, was usually the domain of the Humphrey Bogart types.  Richard Roudtree's John Shaft added more than pigmentation and turtlenecks to the genre.  Roundtree brings an incandescent suaveness and coolness to the screen whether he's browbeating the bad guys, swatting racial insults like they're annoying gnats, or charming the ladies.  Shaft is a classic screen character.  It's unfortunate that "Shaft" is not a classic film.  That can be attributed to a ho-hum storyline involving a Harlem kingpin hiring Shaft to free his kidnapped daughter from Mafia thugs.  With the exception of Shaft, few of the characters in the film transcend the one-dimensional or the stereotypical.  It's on the sheer star wattage of Roundtree that "Shaft" rises above the mundane.

Matthew portrayel of Jesus was unlike any portrayel I ever saw before.  from his tender compassion to jolly sense of humor to his serious side.  Bruce does a great job of acting.  A must see.<br /><br />but when John came out in '03, it wasn't anything like Matthew.  I was highly disappointed.  He wasn't half as jolly as Bruce.  I guess I was expecting something like Matthew.
 | product/productId: 1561270482 | review/userId: AXAX7ASG9CMVR | review/summary: A rare operatic treat on DVD | review/text: It is not often that I enjoy watching an opera on DVD from beginning to end, but this one offered truly a unique experience. Filmed during live performances, one has a sense of being part of a live event. The production is somewhat conservative but visually impressive and always stimulating. Sinopoli's conducting is totally electric and one forgives the occasional excursions of the camera away from the stage to the conductor's face which appears to animate everything else. Tragic but not altogether hard to believe that this fascinating conductor would be dead of a heart attack a few years later.<br /><br />Zampieri - a real comet; she came, dazzled and disappeared. I have no knowledge of any singer who could perform Lady Macbeth like her today.Vocally her  performance is stunning. A tight voice, highly focused that seems to come from the core of her being, always a whisker from disaster, it creates the perfect impression of a woman on edge; a frustrated, a brilliant, a childless woman, who can only reach fulfilment through her husband's grasp of power. It is also a sexy voice, a quality one very rarely encounters in a soprano (not so rarely in a tenor of Corelli's ilk). Having heard the CD version (also very impressive) and not seen Zampieri, I was interested to see what she looked lile on stage. The answe is that she is quite magnificent. The facial expressions are full of different nuances, fear, anger, ambition, contempt, hate, pride - she can do them all to perfection. Here the DVD comes into its own since the facial close-ups, even when she singing, are really thrilling. You really want to see what this woman does next.<br /><br />Renato Bruson is the perfect Macbeth to Zampieri's Lady. A weak, troubled man, whose touch with power unleashes great change inside him, he sings and looks the part and rises to real greatness in his moment of destiny, after the death of his lady. His singing is peerless - the legato perfect (the product of incredible breath control), the pianissimi rounded, quiet and audible and the outbursts of anguish always musical and psychologically convincing. I have never seen a singer sweat on stage as much as he does during this performance - this is totally appropriate and the sweating never seems to interfere with his vocal production. A real masterclass of baritone singing.<br /><br />The other parts are very well sung (including the witches). A minor complaint is that the sound quality could have been better. All in all, this is a special treat.<br /><br />I am concerned that US opera lovers can only acquire this at a very inflated price. I notice that UK Amazon offers it at more reasonable prices and maybe US readers should try to acquire it that way.
 | product/productId: 6300246949 | review/userId: ADUPSGXOSM1VI | review/summary: A great family film for lovers of whimsy | review/text: I am convinced that whether or not you love this movie depends on how much you appreciate whimsical humor.  There is no film more whimsical than Doctor Doolittle; but if you don't appreciate whimsical (odd, quaint, fanciful, eccentric) humor, you will find this movie simply silly and a bore.  I for one love the spirit of whimsy that pervades this film, as well as the beautiful, memorable Leslie Briscusse score, and the lovely cinematography (As a child, I fell in love with the English countryside watching this film).  So, check in your adulthood at the door, step back into the land of make-believe you once inhabited as a child, and you'll have a great time watching this film!

You just don't turn it off!" | review/text: The film centers on John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a vietnam vet and Congressional Medal of Honer winner, who has gone from a Green Beret to a drifter upon his return from 'nam. He has recieved the same harsh treatment by people who, if they went to Vietnam with Rambo, would understand the whole thing better, and know what they were talking about. After trying to visit a war buddy, and finding out that he recently died from Agent Orange, he tries to pass through the small town of Hope, Oregon and is given trouble by sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who, after Ram,bo tries to re-enter town after Teasle drops him off at the city limits, arrests him for vagrancy. Leaving Rambo to the deputies, one of them who takes delight in abusing him, he is beaten, sprayed with a fire hose, and nearly shaved - dry, which would really hurt, by the way. These incidents trigger his 'nam memories, and he escapes, heading for the woods. Teasle takes a posse into the woods in pursuit, and they all end up injured, with one dead due to his own stupidity and no fault of Rambo's. After the battle has been on for a while, the government sends Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna), the colonel who trained Rambo and his unit, to try and get Rambo to surrender. When he won't give up, he tells Teasle that he needs one thing when he deals with Rambo: "a good supply of body bags".<p>This special edition DVD from Artisan has a lot of goodies, plus great sound and video. The extras start with a commentary by the novel's writer David Morrell, who, among other things, tells the differences between the book and the movie (which includes the ending, which I will not spoil here. Plus he did the novelizations of the two sequels, which have the characterization that was needed.). He is a good speaker, and the track is fun to listen to. Next up is a documentary entitled DRAWING FIRST BLOOD: CREATING JOHN RAMBO, where the creators of the movie talk about the adaptation of the novel to the screen. Then the usual production notes, cast and crew information, and trailers. all in all, not a bad package. I also recommend the novel and the soundtrack for the excellent closing credits song and Jerry Goldsmith score. <p>FIRST BLOOD<br />(1982, R)<br />John J. Rambo: Sylvester Stallone<br />Col.

Only Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back and this one are great compared to the first in the series. I would even have to say that Back To  The Future 2 is better than part 1. When Marty finds out ther's trouble for  him in the future, he, his girlfriend and Doc Brown go to 2015 to see what  their future will be like. But when Marty buys a sports almanac, Biff gets  a hold on it and when they go back to 1985, Biff rules all of Hill Valley.  So they must go back again to 1955 and then they find the almanac and burn  it.  But before they go back, Doc is struck by lightning in his car and  sent back to 1885. Now Marty must be helped by the 1955 Doc to get back- to  the future! The #1 reason why I liked this one better than the first is  because I like the graphic description of the future (which is more like  2115 than 2015), and that I would've bought that sports almanac too. What  will happen next? Will Marty go to 1885 or safely go back to 1985? Find out  in part 3!

 | product/productId: 0783231474 | review/userId: A3QGGDITUTK619 | review/summary: You won't find these Antz in yer Pantz! | review/text: The Film: [Rating: 84%] Dreamworks challenger to the Disney ant favourite A Bug's Life arrives on a feature packed DVD complete with a truly sumptuous transfer. Ok, so it's a cartoon - but don't be put off since this  one is loaded with far more wit and style than your average kiddie flick  (isn't he in a A Bug's Life?) and features the vocal talents of Woody  Allen, Sharon Stone, Dan Aykroyd, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Jennifer  Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft and a shed  load more fine actors. Imagine this many actors in a live-action film, the  fees, the makeup, the trailer size contests - I guess doing animation must  be a welcome bit of fun, allowing dress-down days too!<p>The story follows  loner ant Z (pronounced zee, not zed!) who feels there should be more to  life than his lot as a worker ant. Allen plays the lead, supported well be  his best friend and soldier ant Weaver (Stallone). Z's path crosses that of  the bored Princess Bala (Stone) whom he desperately wants to see again.  Following a little persuasion, Z manages to trade places with Weaver for a  place in the soldier's parade - held in front of the royalty! I don't want  to give too much of the plot away since you're better off watching but Z's  adventures to win the heart of the Princess, battle fierce termites  Starship Troopers style, and his all round save-the-day antics are a treat  for young and old alike. Kids will love this great cartoon but only adults  will catch all of the humour and admire the truly stunning computer  animation.<p>It's a pity this was released only one month before Disney's  ant based film and the subsequent press scrutiny they both received in the  'Ant Wars'. They are very different films, just both animated and about  ants. Personally I rate Antz slightly higher but I also think that from a  kid's point of view the adult nature of much of it's humour may put A Bug's  Life out in front as a point decision winner. Take the easy route and give  both pride of place in your DVD collection!<p>The Picture: [Rating: 93%]  Gob smacking! Awesome! Breath-taking! What more can be said about this  1.85:1 original aspect ratio transfer from an all digital source. Colours  are to die for - see the Trash-topia sequence to see what I mean, black  levels are spot on, detail is truly amazing, and there's not a single  imperfection noticeable anywhere. There was some reported moans that the  film was based underground too much, resulting in a too dark, earthy look -  maybe an issue with a VHS copy but not here. This is what DVD and  widescreen were made for! <p>The Sound: [Rating: 82%] Again, absolutely  awesome (do I have to add the word DUDE to truly convince?). Some have  mentioned the drowning out of vocals during some of the terrifically loud  action sequences but this didn't affect me, even on (or maybe because of)  my 'pantz' audio set up. <p>The Extras: [Rating: 70%] Directors Tim Johnson  and Eric Darnel feature on an informative full-length audio commentary.  There's a production featurette running under 5 minutes that is more  interview soundbites than anything else. Much more revealing is the 11  minutes on The Basics of Computer Animation - focusing on the dance  sequence and the water droplet, showing build up from storyboards to the  finished, lighted &amp; shaded animation. Brief but nice is the one minute  on the Antz Facial System. Last of the documentaries is 10 minutes 26  seconds worth of wonderful hand-drawn art work showing the development of  the Antz Character Design. There are four TV spots, along with the  theatrical trailer, but the usual filmo's are blown away by a simple cast  list. Finally there's also eight pages worth of production notes. Packaging  the whole thing together is a fantastic menu system, fully animated with  great transitions from one selection to another and all fully scored.  Selecting the scene index from the front page (by moving the giant  magnifying class!) will drop the 'camera' through the earth, taking you  down to the Antz homeworld before displaying the four individually animated  clips that represent four of the twenty six scenes available - top stuff!  <p>And Finally... [Overall Rating: 86%] Superb presentation - more meat on  the extras would have been nice, but this is nit-picking since everything  here is gold-plated!
 | product/productId: 0790732009 | review/userId: AN8M401S8Y6DA | review/summary: Tragedy Changes Men.  To Blu Ray or Not to Blu Ray | review/text: The American Heritage Dictionary online defines deliverance as the act of being delivered and to rescue from danger or bondage.  The film Deliverance nominated for three Oscars (director, picture, and film editing) shows how a tragedy can change man.  Made as V ietnam was ending and men returning home from war, themselves changed, the film seems an appropriate metaphor rather than mere exploitation.<br />Four friends from the city embark on a weekend canoe trip downriver that is surrounded by poverty stricken tough hillbilly types.  Lewis (Burt Reynolds) is the dominant leader of the group.  Ed (Jon Voight) is a family man who would seem to have grown up with Lewis and idolizes him.  Ed is respected, passive, and is the type that would rather fit in then stand out.  Bobby (Ned Beatty) is the heavyset insurance salesman who is the butt of the joke at times and would rather talk or joke his way out of confrontation.  Bobby is not the laid back type; he is bothered when Lewis gives him a hard time but is submissive and would rather vent to Ed rather then confront Lewis.  Drew is another leader he is independent and has a quite confidence and unlike, Bobby, he voices his opinion and stands his ground.<br />Something horrible happens to Bobby in the woods and Ed is forced to watch helpless, they are both saved by Lewis and Drew but neither will ever be the same again.  Although Lewis rescues them from danger with his bow it is the horrific act and the acts to follow that free them from their bondage of fear.  The scene in the hospital at the end when Ed angrily accuses Bobby about what he thinks he said to the police, at first brushes it off with a smile followed very quickly wish a push, Ed counters this by slamming Bobby against the wall and soon the men have their hands around each others throats and are starring eye to eye.  Bobby, hands around Ed's throat, calmly and steady handed tells him he didn't say anything and Ed believes him.  These are not the same men that entered those woods like the many that enter the jungle and the desert, they have changed.<br /><br />THE BLU RAY - Picture and sound weren't the best I have seen on blu ray but were good.  If you have a blu ray player and own Deliverance I would stick with what you have.  If your buying this for the first time I'd spent the extra dollar it is here on Amazon and get the blu ray.
 | product/productId: 079073155X | review/userId: A2LN2AK7HNBI8N | review/summary: Parody as Art | review/text: I wrestled with whether "Waiting for Guffman" is caricature, parody, or burlesque.  I settled on parody, but really "Guffman" is simply an intelligent, warm, funny film with very strong performances.  Granted, to truly enjoy this film, you have to bond to the "mockumentary" format and style.  I loved "Best in Show", so it was a real treat to see much of the same cast with different characters.<br /><br />In my opinion, what makes it all work is the kindness of the film and the sincerity of the performances.  The subject matter and setting of this film could encourage a mean-spirited style.  The setting is the fictional small town of Blaine, Missouri, but it could be Anywhere, USA.  The subject is the staging of a musical celebrating the town's sesquicentennial and using local talent.  So, the film could skewer small town folks, and poke mean fun at amateur theatre.  But it doesn't, and that's what makes it good.<br /><br />There are some wonderful individual performances here.  My favorite character is the smokin' hot Parker Posey as Libby Mae Brown, a DQ employee cum actress.  Her gum-chewing monlogues are great.  Then there are the local "stars" of community theatre, Sheila and Ron Albertson.  The Robertsons are well played by Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard.  Their audition scene (a choreographed rendition of "Midnight at the Oasis") was brilliant.  Eugene Levy turns in a charming performance as town dentist, Dr. Pearl, who finds his performer within.  Christopher Guest does a good turn as Corky St. Clair, a gay director hidden in the closet, complete with fictional wife.  His divo-style temper tantrums show me that he's observed quite a few tempermental artists in his day.<br /><br />There are many good scenes in this film.  The details and touches matter.  I liked the work of Bob Balaban (Russell from "Seinfeld") as the conductor and usual director of the pageant, Lloyd Miller.  He was aghast at the auditions, he was miffed at being under Corky's direction, he was alarmed at the lack of singing rehearsal.  When he stepped in as director after Corky pulled a divo and left the production, he felt vindicated and assertively took charge.  The scene where Corky is asking the town council for additional funding is wonderful.  Very nice touches were provided by Don Lake as town historian Phil Burgess.  He helps us bond to the town by telling us the town history; how Blaine is the stool capital of the world, about the UFO encounter, and the whistlestop visit of President McKinley.  This makes us care about the town, and the actors make us care about the people, so naturally, we care about the production that follows.<br /><br />And what a production it was!  The production was called "Red, White, and Blaine", and it covered the history of Blaine, complete with alien (played by a half-blind Dr. Pearl).  The tension and excitement backstage is palpable.  Part of the tension arises from the anticipated visit of Guffman, who will ostensibly evaluate the suitability of the show for Broadway.  The overture to this spectacular, conducted by Balaban's Miller was a lot of fun.  Check out the trumpet player doubling as tympanist.  There are great audience details; the pride of Dr. Pearl's wife, played by a seriously made up Linda Kash, was touching.  The emotional response of Councilman Steve Stark, played by Michael Hitchcock, was genuine.  His response was driven by the fact that he couldn't be in the show.<br /><br />Kudos to Lewis Arquette, Christopher Guest, all the crew, and this wonderful ensemble of actors.  It is a piece of work they can all be proud of.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 0790734079 | review/userId: A1K94LXX833JTT | review/summary: Great film comes to Blu-ray July 15th, 2008, DVD details and movie review | review/text: This film profoundly moved me when I finally saw it, long after its 1975 release (while working at a place I won't name that reminded me a little too much of the institution in the film!).  It burns with the intensity of human struggle against oppression, showing how strong, how fragile, and how precious the spark of freedom and dignity is even in what might seem the most unlikely place for it, a mental institution.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson, who won a well deserved Oscar for the role, plays a convict of mixed character who thinks he can game the system but gets in over his head.  His erratic behavior has gotten him transfered from a prison work farm to a mental hospital, which he appears to see as an easier place to serve his time.  Initially careless and arrogant in his dealing with both staff and patients, he comes to care about his fellow inmates, some there voluntarily.  Partly on their behalf he becomes locked into a battle of wills with the domineering, cold Nurse Ratched, who effectively controls the hospital (Louise Fletcher, who also won an Oscar for her role).  While much of the film plays as comedy, the overall frame is that of tragedy mixed with ambiguous victory.  It's easy to see political/social/philosophical context and implications, worth reflecting on, but the basic humanity of the story is central.<br /><br />Besides the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (Milos Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, from the novel by Ken Kesey).<br /><br />The new Blu-ray DVD will carry the same special features as the SD Special Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz<br />-- "The Making of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" documentary (47 minutes)<br />-- additional footage: McMurphy and Dr. Spivey, Chief Captured between Mops, Shaving Chief, Who's the Top Loony Here?, McMurphy Meets Nurse Ratched, First Group Therapy Session, A Bunch a Chickens at a Pecking Party, Mr. McMurphy, Where Are Your Clothes?<br />-- theatrical trailer<br /><br />Specs: 1.85:1 Widescreen 1080p Hi-Def, English Dolby Digital 5.1, French 1.0, Spanish 1.0, German 1.0, Italian 1.0, subtitles in English, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish.  Extras are in standard definition.<br /><br />Hi def is always nice, but this isn't a film that requires high definition to be fully enjoyed, I think, and the SD Special Edition has good video and sound, so if you already have the Special Edition or can get it more cheaply than the Blu-ray, you might like it just about as well.<br /><br />By the way, this film is often compared to Cool Hand Luke, which has some similar themes.  That's also coming out on Blu-ray, though not till September.  The Amazon page for it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TYPIG">here</a>.
 | product/productId: 0790749068 | review/userId: A157XTSMJH9XA4 | review/summary: One Of The Greatest Batman Films Available -- A Must Have! | review/text: (the following is a review for the Original Uncut Version DVD)<br /><br />Plot: "Batman Beyond - Return Of The Joker" takes place in the near future when an eldery Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy) has thrown in the towel and Terry McGinnis (Will Friedle) has become the new Batman. But now isn't exactly the most convenient time to be fighting crime in Gotham City. Thought-to-be-dead supervillain The Joker (Mark Hamil) is back for some old-fashioned deadly business, and seems to be as good as new. And with his gang of "Jokerz" on hand, the Dark Knight is going to have a hard time stopping his destructive path of gleeful lunacy. But there is hope. The answer may be found in a secret surrounding the madman's return that lies in one of the most disturbing mysteries of Batman's past. Can justice finally prevail against this maniacal mastermind? Or will he indeed have the last laugh?<br /><br />ROTJ has a reputation as being one of (if not THE) best animated Batman movies out there. I agree! It has everything you could ask for. The storyline is engaging and fun to follow. And even if you're not up to the mind games, there's plenty of action to keep you entertained from beginning to end. The vocal actors were all wonderful -- especially Mark Hamill as the kooky and darkly charasmatic Joker. His laughs are amazing, and he obviously has a great feel for the lines. Also a big plus for Batfans is the fact that it's the Unrated original version, which earns a PG-13 rating for violence. It's not quite as dark as the comics, but it certainly takes on a more sinister and adult-friendly atmosphere. And to top it all off, this DVD is a superb choice for anyone interested in purchasing the film. Great audio and video quality make the experience of the movie as good as it can get, and the special features are pretty intriguing for any fan. These extras include commentary by the filmmakers, animated character bios (which cover Bruce Wayne, Terry McGinnis, The Joker, and a few gang members), a documentary and more. There's no doubt about it, this is an excellent deal for any fan of the animated Batman (or in that case, the Joker -- Mwahahaha!). Overall, it's definitely worth the surprisingly low cost.

 | product/productId: 0790740834 | review/userId: A2HVL790PBWYTU | review/summary: "Don't be a bad guy. Be a nice guy." | review/text: Nowadays, in looking back at Steven Seagal in his earlier films, when he was at his remorseless aikido-smiting best, I tend to shake my head and mutter half-hearted curses at the waste of the guy (and now the waist of the guy). Seagal really should have had more crunching big screen action flicks under his belt. His first five films (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0WJLE">Above the Law/Hard to Kill</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305168873">Marked for Death</a>, OUT FOR JUSTICE, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732238">Under Siege</a>) were grab-you-by-the-sack thrillers. But then I guess his stiff non-acting, the habitual sameness of his roles, and his indulging in groan-inducing environmental movies finally caught up with him, and so his film career went crapcakes. Still, I remember how entertaining his early years in Hollywood were - how, in movies like 1991's OUT FOR JUSTICE, Steven Seagal showed real promise as an action star.<br /><br />Keep in mind that, when popping in a Seagal opus, elements such as professional acting and multi-layered plotting are kind of discreetly swept under the rug. Seagal never was, is, or ever will be a good actor (but he makes up for it by being a good eater). We tune in to his stuff to check out the down and dirty fight scenes, to see just how brutal the guy can administer his smackdowns. Except that that was back then, when Seagal looked much more impressive, years younger, shed of a boatload of pounds, and not yet inclined to substitute his action-unfriendly elephant girth for stunt body doubles.<br /><br />In OUT FOR JUSTICE Seagal plays Italian-American Detective Gino Felino of NYPD Narcotics. Gino is one of those loose cannon cats who in real life would probably be a head ache and a half to their supervisors. Of course, in this one, when Gino finds out that his partner and best pal had just been gunned down in broad daylight, he offhandedly asks his chief for an unmarked car and a shotgun - and promptly gets it. So off Gino goes on a vendetta-soaked seek and destroy hunt for crazed killer Richie Madano ("Anybody seen Richie?"). And that's pretty much the movie. There's some piddling asides thrown in, such as the local mob lord getting antsy because the crazed killer is being associated with his wise guys and, also, Gino adopts a puppy he liberates from a tied-up bag (although he then ends up leaving the dog in the car for much of the movie). In an attempt to add some color and background to his character, Seagal has Gino occasionally waxing nostalgic about his neighborhood but, sucks to say, these moments merely serve to slow the film down to an agonizing crawl.<br /><br />No, there's not much in the way of redeeming values in OUT FOR JUSTICE. The acting is B-movie worthy, even if there's a smattering of recognizable names (Jerry Orbach, Gina Gershon and a pre-ER Julianna Margulies). As mentioned, the plot is shallow. A caution to the gentler souls, that eff-bombs are dropped with reckless abandon. And, if you're an Italian-American, Seagal's performance sets you guys further back than The West Side Story, in terms of stereotype. As expected, the film's rewards lie in its action sequences. There are four action set pieces - five, if you count an early pimp thrashing. Steven Seagal does his patented scowl, clenched jaw and steely glare schtick as he takes out assorted thugs and hoods in, let's see, a butcher shop, a pool hall, in his soon-to-be divorced wife's apartment, and in the murderous wackjob Richie Madano's temporary hideout. The better beatdowns take place in the butcher shop and, especially, in the pool hall (think Eddie Murphy in that bar scene in 48 HOURS, only more intimidating), and this is because Seagal makes full use of his aikido skills. Let's face it, there's just more satisfaction drawn from applying a hands-on approach when pummeling a goon. But, after those first two venues, Seagal opts to go more with his firearms, which isn't as electrifying.<br /><br />In the So Shameful It's Fun Department, check out OUT FOR JUSTICE also for Seagal's spouting dialogue in Italian, for Seagal again running in that sissy style of his, and for Gino's dubious wardrobe (a beret? Dude, really?). Ending on a good note now, it's cool to hear one of my favorite Beastie Boys cuts ever "No Sleep Till Brooklyn." And, for some reason, Seagal's advice to one assailant in the butcher shop made me laugh: "Don't be a bad guy. Be a nice guy." See, occasionally, Seagal's movies do dispense words of wisdom. Steven Seagal and Aesop, it's like they're twins.<br /><br />I know I've kind of bagged on this film, but I actually like it a lot. Let's say, to the tune of 3.5 out of 5 stars. This was when Steven Seagal actually looked believable as a smiter of men, and in OUT FOR JUSTICE, I really liked his cocky Brooklyn attitude (complete with the cheesy Brooklyn accent) and he even has some solid one-liners. But, unfortunately, there are reasons why he's been consigned to straight-to-video hell.

That's an understatement.  Things aren't quite the sane (uh, same) for Riker when, following a dress rehearsal for a play (Frame of Mind) in which he plays a man imprisoned and tortured in a mental institution, he has a brief, unsettling encounter with a strange--apparently new-- crew member.  And from that point on things for Riker deteriorate rapidly as his distinction between what is the play and what is real blurs.  Who is the sinister crew member and what does he have to do with Riker's conundrum?  Atmospheric episode with evocation of the sinister keeps you guessing right up to the surprise denouement.  Arguably Frakes's best work in the series.

 | product/productId: 0800130448 | review/userId: AMNNPDX9MFEUD | review/summary: Judged on it's own merits...not that bad | review/text: It's hard not to see this as a let down following Desperado and given the additions of some big names, most notably Johnny Depp. However, judged as simply another high action low everything else movie, it isn't that bad. There's lots of explosions, shoot-em up scenes, and some over-the-top squeamishness, but there is enough left-over cool factor from the previous two to make it enjoyable enough. Depp steals the show and in hindsight, I wonder if this was a vehicle made more for him than Banderas, Hayek, or anyone else. His character is compelling to watch as he quirks his way through the convoluted plot and brings a bludgeoningly sardonic element to the otherwise largely two dimensional characters. Hayek is barely present, Mickey Rourke is bland, and Willem Dafoe was simply a bad choice. He does an almost black-face as a Mexican, the make-up so horridly obvious on his fair features. I find it impossible to believe that there were no Latino actors who could've brought equal marquee stature and shored up the woeful lack of credibility brought by Dafoe. Still, Eva Mendes is a nice evil touch and the heart of the movie may just belong to Ruben Blades as the retired FBI agent out to do the right thing.<br />Once again, as in Desperado, there is a boy who plays a small but important role in the movie and adds some humanity to the popcorn carnage.<br />Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a fair part of the trilogy and while it pales in comparison to it's predecessors, standing on its own, it is adequate enough for a good viewing.

Looking at this film again (superbly made for DVD)I find it a mixed bag. On one hand I think it is a great film about relationships with some brilliant performances - the only  thing is that I don't find it very scary. Perhaps it is that I am not  religious in any way so the shocks that are implied through the demonic  imagery now just look dated. The Exorcist is not as scary as the Omen, or  indeed the Blair Witch Project - but watch the Flash trailer on DVD - it's  scarier than the entire film. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the  film, but it is not for the reasons why I usually like horror films.
 | product/productId: 1404948686 | review/userId: A2T7TZBOTP68C7 | review/summary: This is Why We Go to the Movies | review/text: Films like Anacondas 2: Hunt for the Blood Orchid are why we go to the movies.  To escape.  To forget our problems.  Anacondas does not disappoint.  I was enthralled from the moment I pushed play on my DVD player.<br /><br />The filmography is impressive.  There are great panoramic shots of jungles and nice shots of the full moon that gave me chills.  The score of native music lends to the mood of being lost in the jungle with a maniac and giant anacondas.<br /><br />The story is about a group who goes to Borneo to seek rare specimens of the Blood Orchid.  These researchers believe the Blood Orchid has chemical properties that can extend a cell's lifespan, thus prolonging life.  The expedition does not go as planned, and our friends are soon fighting for their lives.<br /><br />The little monkey, Kong, is so cute.  He is a terrific actor.  The director did really well to focus on him so much.  The monkey's facial expressions, chattering, his toting goods, and his obvious emotion should win him Best Supporting Monkey.  He lent a great deal to the film.<br /><br />The DVD extras have deleted scenes, trailers, and a featurette on how they made the anaconda effects as well as how the movie was made.  The director and some of the actors speak about the making of the film.<br /><br />I think we could have seen more snakes.  I just wanted one final, big showdown with the anacondas.

 | product/productId: 6302326311 | review/userId: A1J5TC13BSPA2M | review/summary: One of the most imitated of Action Films. Still the best of the bunch. | review/text: This early John Ford Adventure flick is one that set a standard for countless genre films. The plot is the old story about how a group of soldiers lose there leader and find themselves lost and outnumbered by enemy soldiers.<br />In this film they find there way to an oasis, a seemingly perfect hideout only to discover there in a trap set by arab snipers who pick them off one by one.<br /><br />Ford directs the film with a high sense of tension and a terrifically fast pace that modern viewers may be surprised by. The first shot in the movie is the Patrol's Lieutantant getting shot off his horse. From there on in the action comes randomly and quickly as one by one each man in the Patrol bites the bullet.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding led by Victor Mclaglen as the Sarge, who while likeable and well meaning has led his men to complete disaster. He would be a Ford regular and win an Oscar the following year in Ford's "The Informer" but he's fine here as well.<br /><br />Several cast members may look familiar including Errol Flynn's favorite sidekick, Alan Hale. The usually Brooklyn accented Wallace Ford as a nervous soldier afraid of being alone and handsome Reginald Denny as a ladies man who tells elaborate stories to the group.<br /><br />The film however is easily stolen by Boris Karloff as the maniacal Sanders. He is a religious fanatic who goes mad in a most memorable way as he first finds the Patrol's Oasis spot as the Garden of Eden and later a gate to Hell.<br />Made during the era of his greatest films, this film is one of his more neglected.<br /><br />This is an excellent "lost" Ford film and a must see for the Action/Adventure enthusiast. Unfortunately, it's only avaiable on the Ford film set unless you happen to find it seperately like myself.<br /><br />Happy hunting film fans. Just don't raise your head too high. Those arab snipers barely miss.

There are too many people to blame for this disaster, but at the heart is of course the director, Joel Schumacher. No, he is not the root of all evil, I'm being humorous. Watch Falling Down and Phone Booth, two films that are quite good and showcase that Schumacher isn't a total disgrace as a director. But who in their right mind would want to be responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the worst movies of the decade? I also nominate Michael Bay's Armageddon as another one of the most criminal excesses in Hollywood filmmaking during the 1990's.<br /><br />I remember watching Batman & Robin, I was still 14-15 and hoping for a good Batman flick. Plus Arnold was in it, should be interesting, right? My reaction as I watched this abomination plastered onto celluloid was one of great dismay and the word vomit kept entering my mind. This is Hollywood vomit, pure and simple. Vomit mixed with other stuff you would find only in your friendly, neighborhood sewage treatment facility. Arnold was picking up a paycheck here, a 20 million dollar paycheck! Remember that the only other movie in which Arnold played a villian was the original Terminator. Batman & Robin would be his return as the villian of the piece and he wanted and got top billing at the expense of George Clooney as Batman. Shameful! This is Arnold at his worst, along with all the other actors doing their best to try to milk this venerable franchise until there is nothing left. Greed upon mountains of greed in the boardrooms at Warner Brothers and Joel Schumacher was their willing culprit with his audacious vision of Batman, harking back to the abysmal 1960's television program. This is a joke through and through, the only bright spot is the touching portrayal of Alfred near death, but finally saved through Mr. Freeze's take two and call me in the morning routine! Yeesh! Save us Christopher Nolan with Batman Begins! Oh you did save us. Great! Thanks to you, we can take Batman seriously again. It's been a long time coming.

I was in high school at the time and I was overwhelmed by the film.  Seeing it in NYC on the big screen was an experience I will never forget.  The film is first rate and is probably the best film I've ever seen.  Peter O'Toole is excellent as Lawrence but it is the photography that gives this film its greatness.  No digital images or tricks here...it was all done the old fashioned way and it was done superbly!  I hope the DVD keeps the score intact..including the Overture.  Maurice Jarre's score is unforgettable.  GET THIS FILM!!  You will love it.
 | product/productId: 0780629167 | review/userId: A1UNQJ76D7N74 | review/summary: A GREAT &quot;AGENDALESS FILM&quot; | review/text: What I loved most about this film is it's lack of &quot;message&quot; or agenda.  Other then telling a great story this film had nothing to &quot;prove&quot;.  There were no tearfelt speeches for aids victims, no  angst about the pain of coming out, just great characters engaged in a  funny offbeat script (with dialouge as good as any by Neal Simon) that  works.  There are many complicated plot elements that all come together  nicely and that's not easy to do.  The way the writer ties the lead  characters struggle to finish his song with the rest of the plot is  brilliant.  I also differ with the criticism of a previous writer who  claimed the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in  &quot;reality&quot;. One could see from J.P. Pitoks admirable performance  that the character was more then just a beefcake. In fact i thought they  made a really cute realistic couple not in spite of but BECAUSE of their  differences.  The ending scene of them walking down the street said it  all.....Gabriel couldn't shut up, and Mark couldn't speak. But laughed in  the right places.  A great film. The fact that no &quot;message&quot; is  needed shows that the gay community might be beginning to feel more  accepted.

A sincere attempt is made here to understand the basic tenants of the Muslim faith and Islamic tradition. However, the viewer gets the definite impression that this video was designed for a Midwest church fellowship meeting discussing creatures from another planet. The intent to convert the misguided Muslims into evangelical Christians is both blantant and patronizing. If you're seeking objective information, this is not your best choice.  However, if your quest is for ideological justification masquerading as education, you've found the right vehicle.
 | product/productId: 6302405866 | review/userId: A21X0EO0R0T6FT | review/summary: How it could have looked like | review/text: Let's get what's bad out of the way.<br /><br />There's no point in whining about what Schloendorff got wrong in his adaptation, or what he left out. For instance I didn't much like how the famous last line of "Swann in Love" was rendered ("To think I've wasted the best years of my life..." etc.). But let's face it: you can't take a two-million-plus word novel and turn it into a movie without losing _something_. Just accept it.<br /><br />My other gripe is that neither of the two lead characters say their own lines. Jeremy Irons (English) and Ornella Muti (Italian) are dubbed by French actors. Most Europeans would have seen a dubbed version anyway given how unpopular subtitles are in Europe. To a non-European, it's silly to have a movie dubbed even in the original language, but I suppose it's part and parcel with the European Union's subsidized financing of culture.<br /><br />That aside, the adaptation is far from being all bad.<br /><br />Alain Delon as Charlus is especially good. Despite being dubbed, Jeremy Irons looks spot on as Charles Swann. He's got the right balance of haughty manliness and effeminate aristocratic French charm. Ornella Muti is lovely as the cocotte Odette, except that I was disappointed for personal reasons. I saw Muti in a later film, where she was breathtakingly stunning as housewife to a French lawyer ("Un Couple Epatant"). As beautiful as she was at 28, she was ten times more beautiful twenty years later at 48.<br /><br />As a period piece, the film shines. Swann's tuxedos, the Guermante's Salon, the stone paved streets, the horse drawn carriages, the lady's dresses.<br /><br />Much of the dialog is lifted straight out of Proust, almost word for word although the context is sometimes changed. For example, Swann is gathering information on Odette from a prostitute who relates how she has seen Odette with another woman in Nice. In the book, the prostitute's words are actually taken from a letter by a servant taking the testimony of a laundry girl for the narrator of a later book in the series who is investigating his own lover, Albertine, some twenty years later.<br /><br />Schloendorff's film is a dreamy rendition worth seeing on its own, and if fans of the book lower their expectations, the film is a masterful visualization of Proust's "monde".<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo

 | product/productId: 5552286219 | review/userId: A340VLH8QDWB8Q | review/summary: Cool dragons, flimsy plot | review/text: First of all, my actual rating of this movie is 3.5 stars, but since I can't rate using fractions of a star I decided to be generous.<p>"Reign of Fire" starts with a young boy named Quinn going to visit his mother in the English mine where she works.  He wanders over to where one of her co-workers has encountered a problem, and the man sends him into the hole he has dug.  Inside, Quinn discovers a gigantic dragon that unleashes its fire on the mine, leaving a wake of destruction.<p>Twenty years or so later, Quinn (Christian Bale) find himself the leader of a colony of survivors that have managed to evade the dragons and to survive the nuclear winter caused by humanity's attempts to destroy the dragons.  Enter Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American soldier with a mission to kill all dragons.  Fate teams the unlikely pair together, and with the help of helicopter pilot Alex (Izabella Scorupco), they go on a quest to save the world.<p>I found "Reign of Fire" to be somewhat of a disappointment in terms of plot.  I was hoping for a lot more.  The premise of the dragons-rule-the-world concept was cool and convincing in a fantasical sort of way, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie.  From there, the plot sort of when downhill.  It didn't flow smoothly, and I found the climax to be the greatest disappointment of all.  It just seemed too easy at the end.  The acting was more than adequate, but it just couldn't save the flimsy plot.<p>However, the special effects were great (which is why I gave this 3.5 stars).  The dragons were very realistic: they flew naturally and breathed fire just the way you would expect a dragon to.  Even the dead dragons looked real.  My one request would be that the dragons be given more screen time.<p>Bottom Line:  Awesome dragons, not much story.  Only go if you like dragons, Christian Bale, or action movies.
 | product/productId: 5552666534 | review/userId: A13H2JJ3GEMJN1 | review/summary: A Real Favorite | review/text: HOME ALONE was very successful in its theatrical run and its popularity has proven to be enduring. Small wonder. This is a very funny and entertaining movie. Kevin, the youngest member of his family, goes to bed wishing his family would disappear. The following morning finds his family in a rush to get to the airport to catch their flight to Paris, where they are going to spend the Christmas holiday, and running very late. In the hubbub, Kevin gets left behind. He awakens to find that his wish seems to have been granted; he's been left home alone. His elation at finding he's the "man of the house" is only one of many great scenes in this movie. Macaulay Culkin shines as Kevin. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also very funny as a pair of burglars working the neighborhood.<br /><br />The editorial reviewer here comments that the "violence" in the later stages of HOME ALONE is "over the top". Over the top of what? There are no knives or machine guns in evidence here. Some broken christmas tree ornaments, a red hot doorknob, a couple of paint cans, some icy stairs, a b-b gun ... this is the kind of violence we're talking about here. Realistically, yeah, these burglars are ridiculously inept and somebody could get seriously hurt on slippery concrete steps, but as theatrical violence goes this is pretty harmless stuff. Pretty funny stuff, too.<br /><br />This is a classically funny movie and one the whole family can enjoy. If you haven't seen it, give yourself a treat. If you're like me, you'll want your own copy so you can watch it whenever the mood hits. With Christmas a central part of the plot, HOME ALONE works especially well during the holiday season. Five stars and strongly recommended.

I think that I have some things in common with Mark, we both dream of making movies, we both want to do nothing else in life, we both love horror movies, and neither one of us has ever actually directed a feature film. The only problem for Mark is that he has been trying to for a very long time. American Movie documents the process of mark trying to make Northwestern, his epic indie horror film. In the process we get to meet a lot of interesting characters and see a lot of interesting sights. We get a bit of a glimpse into the genius that is Mark Borchardt.<br /><br />The DVD is especially great because it has Coven as a special feature. The short film that we see Mark finish during the documentary. American Movie is hilarious, heartwarming and at times heartbreaking. I know that I will be first in line to see Northwestern if it ever shows at my local theatre.

Look at all the Christmas classics that have come out on DVD over the last few years, and I am waiting patiently for EASTER PARADE for that holiday.  By accident, I discovered this great film, which is one of my favorite musicals, was getting the DVD treatment.  After exploring more today (a week from release), I am "FLOORED" that it will be the director's cut, as I have only seen the VHS and TV-broadcast edited version.  I was never fortunate to see the Laser Disc with the extra footage.  Prior to it's recent Broadway revival closing, I took in 1776 with the current cast and thouroughly enjoyed it, and witnessed for the first time the song that was cut from the film.  I am waiting anxiously now until next Tuesday so I can finally see this masterpiece in its full form for the first time.  The cast is splendid, and I agree with another reviewer here that if Ben Franklin is not Howard DaSilva's portrayal when we reach the pearly gates, we will be disappointed.  One of the few film versions of a musical that retains most of the original cast, William Daniels as John Adams is superb, as is Mr. DaSilva, Ken Howard, John Cullum, et al.  For the ladies, Blythe Danner is time-period gorgeous as Mrs. Thomas Jefferson, and Virginia Vestoff as Abigail Adams has a glorious voice.  I don't know what happened to her, but she should have been a standards concert star in the realm of Garland and Streisand.  I've seen this film every July 4 for years, and now will have it on DVD.  You should too!
 | product/productId: 1558808809 | review/userId: A1CIW2OEVAJRM2 | review/summary: Strong story, weak depth, but epic & entertaining | review/text: Based on the novel by Howard Fast, Spartacus recounts the life of a slave turned gladiator turned freedom fighter.  The story of Spartacus begins with him as a free spirited Thracian slave in 70BC.  Spartacus is trained in a gladiator school, where he meets and falls in love with the slave girl Varinia.  He then leads the other gladiators in revolt, and assembles a huge army of thousands of slaves to challenge the might of Rome.  The ending is tragic, but not without hope.  Spartacus was in fact a historical figure and the movie's story of his squashed rebellion against Rome - including the crucifixion of 6000 survivors - is largely rooted in truth.<p>The movie can best be described as epic.  On a grand scale, the Roman empire is brought to life, with its corrupt aristocracy and its simple lower class.  The epic battle scene which forms the climax of the movie features 1000s of extras, and although it is sometimes hard to tell who is on which side, the effect is magnificent and grandiose.  Despite the action scenes, the movie is surprisingly introspective at times.  Unlike modern efforts such as Gladiator, Spartacus is not an action movie as such, and fans of contemporary action movies not surprisingly find it disappointing.  Spartacus' struggles are just as much emotional as they are physical.  But to me this is a strength and not a weakness: the shortcoming of most modern action movies is not present here because the characterization is superb.<p>Even though the movie is not gory (although it is bloody at times), the adult themes make it unsuitable for children.  For instance, successful gladiators are given women to have their way with them.  And on numerous occasions, although nudity is not shown it is strongly implied and barely concealed.  The implication of bisexuality (in a scene not present in the original) and promiscuity is also strongly evident as part of the corruption in Rome.  But it also touches Spartacus.  In a rather daring move for the 1960s, Spartacus and his woman Varinia conceive a child out of wedlock, which is presented as natural and good.  Spartacus' fight for freedom apparently includes sexual freedom.  Its hardly surprising that these two fall in love in a rather sappy love-at-first-sight Hollywood romance, where they don't even know each other as yet.  Ultimately it is not only Rome that chases gold, girls and glory without morals, but Spartacus himself is not really much different.<p>But it is not only the moral ambivalence of this movie that disturbs me, but also its underlying political themes.  How is Rome presented?  As totally corrupt, with no redeeming qualities.  "If a criminal has what you want, you do business with him." How are the slaves presented?  As noble and good.  "We're brothers." The army of slaves proceeds in a carnival like atmosphere, and the producers present lots of images of joyful children and exuberant elderly as part of their number, to arouse sympathy for their cause.  But isn't this rather a clich&eacute;?  It is, but that's the whole point.  Aristocratic Rome is presented as evil, and the oppressed lower class need to be liberated from her corrupt rule.  The rich are all evil, the poor are all good.  Sounds familiar?  It's a defence of the brotherhood of communism.  Ultimately the movie endorses peasant revolt as a legitimate option, and advocates rebelling against authority.  Rather than rendering to Caesar what is Caesars, it encourages open rebellion, in order to usher in a new political system of brotherhood and freedom from repression.  Sound too far-fetched?  Here's the clincher: Howard Fast, author of the novel on which this movie was based, was a devout and committed member of the Communist Party of the USA, and for many years his works were black-listed.  The story of Spartacus may be rooted in history, but Howard Fast has reinterpreted it as a defence of his own political communist ideals.  Rome represents Western Capitalism, and the slaves represent the oppressed peasant proletariat.  Spartacus' defence of liberty, equality and fraternity is in fact anachronistic.  <p>So sure this is an epic movie.  At the time of its production in 1960, Spartacus was the most expensive movie ever made.  With a cast of star actors, especially the compelling performances of Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, Laurence Olivier as Crassus (the influential Roman senator), Peter Ustinov as Batiatius (the bumbling and greedy owner of a gladiator school), and Charles Laughton as Gracchus (the corrupt and scheming Roman senator), it's no wonder it won four academy awards.  But the fact that Spartacus is an epic movie does not disguise the fact that it is not deep.  Any deeper themes that the movie does have to offer are communist and hedonistic, and this ideology mars the story. This may be a movie that rivals the grandeur and scale of Ben Hur, but thematically, it doesn't come close.  <p>Even so, it's still worth a look.  Even if one cannot share the cause of Sparticus and political ambitions it embodies, one has to admire the spirit in which Spartacus fights for his cause: it is a losing battle, and yet with dignity and fervour he fights for what he believes is right - a quality to be coveted. And it's ironic that if you can overlook the weaknesses of its depth, the strength of this movie lies in its superficial story.  It has comedy, tragedy, triumph, romance, action, intrigue, and an epic scale.  As entertainment, it's an enduring epic that still can be enjoyed today.

It was intense then and it still is; even with all of the "mistakes".  Those who think Made-for-TV-Movies are ordinary or average needs to see this.  Supposedly, there were disclaimers when it aired, but I don't remember them.  The video is dated videotape quality.  Seeing this brought back memories of watching "The Day After" on ABC; uncut (the current DVD is an edited version) and with very few commercials (after the inital 1/2 hour, I don't remember seeing any).<br /><br />Some may not remember, but there were, at least, two more shows like this one; one was of a failed Mars landing where the astronauts were killed by Martians and the other (which I remember was very engrossing) was of an alien visitation that goes wrong.  I hope they will be releasing these soon; particularly the latter.<br /><br />UPDATE: I finally discovered the titles of the two other faux news reports mentioned above.  The botched alien visitation was called "Without Warning".  The Mars landing one was called: "Special Report: Journey to Mars".

 | product/productId: 6302363284 | review/userId: A2HVL790PBWYTU | review/summary: ASTAIRE & GARLAND - NUFF SAID!! | review/text: I'm typing away on this Easter evening while simultaneously watching Easter Parade on the TCM network. I haven't actually got the dvd so I can't comment on its transfer quality, special features, etc. I can, however, comment on the movie itself. I just want to let whoever's reading this know that Easter Parade ranks right up there with the very best of musicals. The backstory on this film is that Gene Kelly was originally slated to co-star with Judy Garland, but because of an injury, had to bow out. Enter Fred Astaire, who was in semi-retirement but who agreed to do the movie after having received Kelly's blessing. Easter Parade was so well received that a second pairing of Astaire and Garland was scheduled but due to Garland's (ahem) personal issues, that regretfully never came to pass.<br /><br />The plot is standard golden oldie: Don Hewes (Astaire), sulking in a bar after his dance partner Nadine (Ann Miller)  breaks up the partnership,  boasts that he could turn any woman into a capable dancing partner. He then sets eyes on plain jane chorus girl Hannah Brown (Garland) and picks her to be his Eliza Dolittle. After a few pitfalls, they become a successful act. Oh yeah, somewhere along the way, amidst jealousies and misunderstandings, they manage to find time to fall in love. There is also a subplot with Peter Lawford's character, who fancies Hannah and who, in turn, is fancied by Nadine. There's even a funny bit done by Frank Mayo, the restaurant headwaiter (please, please try his salad). The only downside is that I find Ann Miller to be quite annoying, as I don't believe for one minute she's as good a dancer as she seems to think she is. But that is a minor quibble in an otherwise delightful musical.<br /><br />Has there ever been a dancer as graceful, as sophisticated as Fred Astaire? Who else can make dancing look so effortless? And who has better pipes than Judy Garland? These two stars are superb in their acting roles and they are pure perfection in their musical performances.  Irving Berlin's songs are showcased here and are done right proper. My personal favorites are "Drum Crazy", "Steppin' Out With My Baby", "A Fella With An Umbrella" and "We're A Couple of Swells" (Judy's comedic touch is invaluable in this song). Easter Parade is a feel-good classic, starring two superb professionals who were, at the time, still at the height of their talents. Watching it has never failed to garner in me a sense of comfort and nostalgia. I make it a point to park my rear on the sofa and catch it whenever it's on television, Easter holiday or not.
 | product/productId: 6300247171 | review/userId: A3OBBWCDNIYT8D | review/summary: In space, no one can hear you scream. | review/text: I think that is the best tag-line for a movie ever! &quot;Alien&quot; is visually stunning, no doubt, and at times very scary. The plot is familiar, of course, but the characters make up for it. This movie made Sigourney Weaver a star, playing one of the great screen characters Ellen Ripley. My favorite character in this movie is Parker, who has the best lines. The pacing is slow, to be sure, but it helps build up the tension and get you to care about the characters and their situations. The sometimes slow pacing is the one thing I don't like about this movie. Not that I need action to keep my attention. I like suspense as well as action. I recommend this movie to sci-fi or Alien fans, if you don't mind the slow pacing that I mentioned. The sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; is even better and more fast-paced, and I'll tell you that I've been having dreams about it for weeks. By the way, I also want to tell you that the theatrical trailer for &quot;Alien&quot; from 1979 was scary, and my favorite scene in the movie is the baby-alien/stomach-bursting scene, which is a classic!

 | product/productId: 1574924346 | review/userId: AVFXFDO29FQOK | review/summary: Comparative Review | review/text: The Movie "Ellen Foster" followed the journey that a young abused girl takes to find a place to call home.  Based on the book written by Kaye Gibbons, this horrifying but yet modern story makes the common day person thankful for their wonderful but not perfect life. With both famous screen stars such as Jena Malone and Amanda Peet and debuting cast such as Allison Jones, this movie is definetly one to put in a time capsul. Honorable mentions also include Kate Burton, Ted Levine, Julie Harris, Debra Monk, Glynnis O'Connor and director John Erman. With a star studded cast list and amazing author of the movie's base, this movie is set for life.<br /><br /> Ellen Hammond (Malone) was a young girl with adult-like maturity. Many children her age  had never seen or felt what she had. When the movie opens, we see Ellen's father Bill (Levine) drunk and asleep on the couch. Ellen is going to get her mother from the hospital with her aunt.  When Ellen's mother, Charlotte (O'Connor) returns, she is faced with orders from her husband to clean and cook when she really should be in bed resting. Charlotte works herself to her own death that day,  and that is when Ellen's journey begins.<br /><br /> Ellen's school relizes that Bill is abusing Ellen and relocates her to the Art Teacher Julia's ( Peet) house. Ellen is loved and cared for there until a court order sends her to live with her grandmother Leonora Nelson (Harris), who hates Ellen and Bill with all her might.  Leonora believes that it was Ellen and Bill's fault that Charlotte died, and she forces Ellen to work as a maid as a form of revenge. When Leonora dies, Ellen is sent to live with her aunt Nadine (Monk). Nadine is very wealthy and spoils her daughter, and Ellen is never truly welcome in the house. After an intense argument, Ellen leaves the house and goes to a foster mother. There she is accepted and is loved, and Ellen changes her name to Ellen Foster.<br /><br /> Though this movie was fascinating, it left out Ellen's deepest feelings. What was so amazing in the book was how strong and independent she was. The movie seemed to touch her lifestyle rather then her actual inner self.  It was the writers who had a challenge in front of them and took the audience friendly side of the story or in my opinion, the easy way out.Kaye Gibbons' message was not stated to the extent that she portrayed it in the book.<br /><br /> This movie has a definite feel to it that will not be lost, which is sad. In 1997, when this movie came out, abuse was found everyday. Eight years later, nothing has changed. I guess that is what will keep this movie alive for generations to come.

One night, some frat brothers infiltrate the urban area to carry out a prank at the order of their... frat-master (or whatever those guys are called), run into Splatter and his henchmen, and find themselves on the run for the rest of the film.  Granted, the movie does have some noble stabs at social relevance, with the anti-nuke references, and the presentation of a punkish lifestyle as unified and peaceful...  <p>But &quot;Future-Kill&quot; is like 5 minutes of good ideas stretched out to feature length, with lots of abandoned-warehouse padding in between.  The opening minutes trick the viewer into thinking that this could be a blend of horror AND comedy, but things get vicious (and tedious) pretty quickly.  Much of the acting is poor (to say the least), and Neal's villain isn't given enough screen time.<p>This movie will be mildly diverting for seasoned genre fan, but casual viewers should steer clear.  &quot;Future-Kill&quot; isn't horrible...and it does represent a time when low-budget cinema was alive and uncompromising...but it isn't anywhere near good.

It takes place right after the events in Part Two, and a new a bunch of teens go camping.  They have no idea of the shocking events that happened just a few days ago, and the terrifying events to come.  The acting is very well done compared to the other films in this series.  Some of the scenes are cheesy, but still great.<p>The DVD itself is great.  I have never seen this film so clear or sharper before until I bought the DVD.  On the VHS version, the picture looks very grainy, but on the DVD it looks like it's just been released.  If you're a Friday the 13th fan, then I strongly suggest you pick this up!

 | product/productId: 6302075726 | review/userId: A2CW9IQAPFEYLM | review/summary: Magnificent artistic achievement based on backward viewpoint | review/text: The first great epic of the screen - but it's as if Shakespeare wrote a play glorifying Attila the Hun. The subject here is the Civil War and Reconstruction; in the last part of the movie the KKK is made out to be the saving force of the "honorable" South. Blacks are shown abusing the powers granted them in government and the military after the War in the most blatantly racist terms: they're shiftless, debauched, and "primitive." This is bad enough, but when the movie first came out the NAACP pressured Griffith to cut even more racially explicit scenes, which he did (the scenes supposedly included white women being attacked by half-crazed blacks and a "final solution" calling for blacks to be sent back to Africa); these scenes have apparently been lost.<br /><br />But despite this stomach-churning point of view, the picture defined what cinema could do: it could tell a unified story of substantial length in a language and style purely its own. The movie was longer than anything else before it, yet the story and action unfold with great rapidity - it doesn't lag for a minute.<br /><br />The movie was shot almost in total secrecy, and Griffith worked without a written script, though it's obviously based on Thomas E. Dixon's novel THE CLANSMAN, with scenes from another Dixon novel, THE LEOPARD'S SPOTS, included (the movie, in fact, opened in LA with that title, THE CLANSMAN, with Griffith changing it a month later when the movie premiered in NYC). The cast was often clueless regarding scenes being filmed and how it was all supposed to add up to a single production. Many before-release predictions were negative, some portending a box-office disaster, but more people ended up seeing this picture during its first year of release than any other movie.<br /><br />As a work of art, the picture is a landmark production. It's truly the birth of narrative film, and filmmakers studied this film for years gleaming ideas, from the use of symbolism to intercutting techniques to employing close-ups. But socially the film produced some very negative repercussions, the most grievous being its connection to the rise of the KKK in the 1920s. Taking all of this into account, though the picture contains stunning artistic accomplishments, because its racist attitudes are so painful for viewers today, it must be seen more from an historic perspective now.

 | product/productId: 0767800117 | review/userId: A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS | review/summary: Controversial, But An Excellent Movie, Nevertheless | review/text: This movie is most definitely one of the greatest war movies ever made.  I was pretty young when this movie was first released in 1989, but I can still remember all the discussion and controversy that ensued after its release.  I happened upon this movie and decided to see for myself if all the hoop-la was warranted.  While it may have been controversial in the 80s, the years have softened the movie's shock value, but it still remains a masterfully made and entertaining movie.<p>This is the story of the black soldiers who fought for the Union during the Civil War.  Matthew Broderick plays a young colonel assigned to train a company of former slaves to become soldiers who will fight in the battle against the Confederacy.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher play three of the hundreds of black men who volunteer to join the army.  At first, the heads of the Union army treated this company of black soldiers as a joke.  They were recruited to fulfill some sort of quota.  They received poor equipment and low wages, and were never intended to fight in battle.  However, the colonel sees their desire and convinces his superiors to send them into battle.  The end of the movie has this company of black soldiers leading the Union arm into the battle at Fort Wagner in South Carolina.  Since this movie is based on actual events, it isn't too much of a spoiler to mention that they lost the battle for Fort Wagner, but the outcome of the battle isn't as important as the solidarity and patriotism with which they fought.  <p>I've seen "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" many times, so I'm a little uncomfortable seeing Matthew Broderick in a serious role.  He's not much of a dramatic actor, but he does a solid job here.  Though Denzel Washington won an Academy Award for his supporting role, this was clearly an ensemble cast that equally shares the acclaim for their terrific performances.  Morgan Freeman seemed a little too old to be in a movie like this, but he also did a commendable acting job, as did Andre Braugher.  <p>This movie receives some criticism because historians claim that it doesn't accurately depict the actual events on which it is based.  I, personally, don't believe that historical accuracy should be a consideration when determining the quality of a movie.  I watch movies to be entertained, not educated.  If I wanted to learn about the actual facts I'll open a textbook or watch a documentary.  There was also a slight uproar by leaders of the black community who didn't appreciate a movie where black people were being taken advantage of.  Many were angered by the fact that they were deliberately put on the front lines in battle so they would be the first to die.  <p>All these disputes may never be resolved, but they cannot diminish the fact that this is a great movie.  Besides the great acting, there are very good special effects, good camera angles, and an awesome musical score.  I highly recommend that you see this movie.

 | product/productId: 6301781279 | review/userId: A302DA2OZ14D2K | review/summary: My Childhood Reborn! | review/text: I cannot tell you how happy I was to see this officially released on DVD. Like seriously. Every Saturday morning in the early 80's, I would wake up (even though it wasn't a school day), prepare my cereal and watch THUNDARR the BARBARIAN.<br /><br />Every. Single. Saturday.<br /><br />I think this might be one of the most imaginative and coherent "magic-meets-science" storylines of that decade. It's really a shame the series didn't run longer. It has truly inspired me as an artist in my adult life. I still have dreams about the wizard with two faces (Gemini) or the battle between Thundarr, Ookla, and Ariel with the scorpion machine outside the ruins of Las Vegas. And who could forget Circe the witch who trades bodies with Ariel for a bit of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" on a post-apocalyptic London landscape? They're all here. Wizards, monsters, and war machines that set the template for creativity long before the animated series genre went down the toilet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series if you are a fan of 70's/80's animation. Heck, I even made my 10 year old nephew watch it (he loved it) and we drew the characters afterward. This is some timeless art of the cartoon era.<br /><br />p.s. Despite some comments here, this DVD set played superbly on my home computer (desktop). So I am not sure why anyone is having issues with that. BEST purchase of the year (for me).

 | product/productId: 6300988791 | review/userId: A1RDPBXEFS35K9 | review/summary: An age of innocence | review/text: Well before Adrian Lyne's morality tales about adultery came this David Lean non-epic that didn't burst, early into the film, with sexual aggression.  Rather, that subtle pain of nervous tension, between adults who are attracted to each other but who are not allowed to act on it, is brought to life in an age of innocence and rules.<p>Lean's style is stylistic in subtle doses (we can neither forget the atmosphere of the train station, nor the tilting camera when suicide almost happens).  It is a compact, Lean (pun intended) narrative that had to be, immediately upon completion, an eternal masterpiece.<p>This Criterion Collection DVD bears an excellent transfer; it must have coincided with the new print I saw at the American Film Institute National Theater in Washington.  However, unlike most Criterion DVDs, there is very little in the nature of extras, other than a commentary track and a brief description of the restoration process.  (That is to say, no documentary.)

 | product/productId: 1604860170 | review/userId: A10TG366HY58NO | review/summary: Grassroots study of political and social change | review/text: 'Venezuela from the Inside Out', (2007) is Clif Ross's sympathetic but balanced update on the Bolivarian revolution led by Hugo Chavez Fr&iacute;as, seen as a grassroots movement from the bottom up. Ross is a poet and translator and long-time Berkeley leftist who has traveled extensively in Latin America and has made use of today's readily accessible, affordable digital filming and editing tools to produce a vivid, exciting documentary about Venezuela today, the "revolution from the inside out." Ross did on the spot interviews in Venezuela's schools, rural lending banks, and cooperatives and talked to campesinos, leaders, and American scholars to provide an in-depth study of the movement. This film, which I learned about from Ross himself, whom I've known for a decade, has rarely been shown in theaters but is available from Amazon on DVD or for rental from Netflix. It's provided with both Spanish and English subtitles, as needed. Most of it is in Spanish, but there's an excellent perspective provided through interviews in English with a number of American and other experts, advisers, and scholars. These include Dr. Steve Ellner of Universidad de Oriente, Puerto La Cruz; Jos&eacute; Sant Roz of Universidad Socialista del Pueblo, M&eacute;rida; Jutta Schmitt of Universidad de los Andes, M&egrave;rida; Roger Burbach, Director of the Center for the Study of the Americas, Berkeley, CA, and Christene DeJong, of the Center for Latin American Studies, University of California, Berkeley.<br /><br />Revolution from the Inside Out is valuable addition to the documentary film literature on Latin America and deserves to be seen along with the recent political documentaries about Argentina by Fernando E. Solanas, The Dignity of the Nobodies (2006) and Latent Argentina (2007) and Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain's 2003 Chavez: Inside the Coup.<br /><br />Clif's particular focus is the cooperatives, which the film depicts as the flawed but essential institution of the Bolivarian revolution. On one level they help eradicate poverty--one of Chavez's major aims--by giving people work. On another, they are training programs providing job skills. On still another, they reshape the culture by developing a sense of cooperation, of the nation and the people as sharing a common, altruistic endeavor based consciously on socialist ideals. "We are here for a purpose," Humberto Morales, a worker in a farm cooperative out in the country, tells Ross's camera. "How do you feel working in the cooperative?" the filmmaker asks. "Happy. Delighted with life," the young man answers. "Producing for the people. When these potatoes are produced, they'll be sold all over the country. We're all family here. A family working together."<br /><br />But another smiling young man, this time in the city of M&eacute;rida, talks frankly about the lingering bad habits that Venezuelan society has to overcome before it can move decisively forward. And the film points out with commentary and examples that the Venezuelan cooperatives aren't utopias. Some succeed, but many fail. Some of them don't work so well because of trouble finding trainees and organizing the work. And some organizers are unwilling to share; they become bosses and the cooperative destroys itself, or turns into a capitalistic enterprise like any other, when it is designed to be socialistic. John Curl, in Berkeley, and Steve Ellner, who lives and works in Venezuela--both Americans who know the country--comment on the problems. Cooperatives are like small businesses, and and two-thirds of them fail in the early stages, as small businesses do. An additional factor is the persistence of cultures from the time of the ruling oligarchy of the rich: the laziness, indifference, cynicism, and corruption the young man in M&eacute;rida refers to.<br /><br />But importantly, some cooperatives have developed revolutionary socialist structures, says George Ciccariella-Maher, and have transformed institutions and people in the process. The film gives comments about the Frente Nacional Campesino and ends with the Zamora Vive cooperative, a particularly rigorous and idealistic one. We have heard from Javier Bolanos, its president about his with that Venezuela should achieve "food sovereignty." An older man with bright eyes and missing teeth--the unforgettable final closeup--says now "the old darkness disappears," and now, thank God, "even children see clearly." Ross has put together a rich 85 minutes. He leaves you wishing for more.

It's all about the human spirit, in overcoming the limitations of a repressive society in the not-too-distant future.  It has the elements of _Brave New World_ and _1984_.<p>Vincent (Ethan Hawke) illegally assumes the identity of a genetic &quot;superman&quot; (crippled in an accident) in order to become a space pilot, rather than scrub floors for the rest of his life.  Those two characters couldn't be more opposite.  One has the &quot;wrong&quot; genes; the other has the right ones but no ambition.<p>The acting is excellent, particularly that of underrated Ethan Hawke and Jufe Law.  The whole style is chrome retro-70s and 80s, especially the homes and social centres of the genetic elite. Add a dash of mystery and suspense, for an excellent movie.  The technology of _Gattaca_ is inconsistent, such as manned Titan probes along with 1990s computers.  Another example is medical technology able to predict lifespans from a drop of blood, but not fix a broken spine.  That last one may be deliberate, and if so, another sad comment on that society and its priorities.<p>Those convinced that science fiction has no soul really need to see this movie!

Maggie Smith is just fantastic in this role and the story is still surprising and exciting.  Set in Edinburgh the movie brings back fond memories of when I used to live there.  This is the best movie I have bought in ages.  My daughter who is only 14 and who had never seen Maggie Smith when she was in her 'prime' also enjoyed it tremendously.

 | product/productId: 6300181251 | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: The truest definition of horror... | review/text: I don't think you can call yourself a film enthusiast if you are not a fan of Hitchcock.  Part of loving film is finding solace in the technique used to create film, and truly there is no other director who possesses the technique Hitchcock possessed.  The famed director was truly a master of his craft, able to generate genuine emotion from his audience, always using every advantage at his disposal and creating authentic and moving pictures that are still unmatched even today.  While he has delivered many masterpieces, in my humble opinion `Psycho' is his finest work.<br /><br />When you watch `Psycho' there are many techniques Hitchcock utilized to the superlative degree to deliver to his audience perfection.  First, and maybe foremost, we have the brilliant score.  Music can be a key to creating the perfect mood and tone for a film.  Think back to the ominous baritone that bubbles from the depths of `Jaws' and even recently, films like `Atonement' and `There Will Be Blood' have utilized the power of music to elevate scenes and cement themselves into our memories.  `Psycho' has probably the most memorable of all film scores for I can still hear those screeching violins every time I step into the shower.  Secondly, Hitchcock shot the film in classic black and white, even though color was an option.  Now while his initial reasoning for the decision may have been to save money, the end result leads the audience down a much more fulfilling path than had he opted for a color film.  Having seen Gus Van Sant's remake (which really isn't as horrible as critics labeled it) I can honestly say that color works against this film.  The rich grays and blacks help stir the feelings of imminent danger, helping to solidify feelings of fear even when nothing frightening is taking place on the screen.  The editing is also ferociously engrossing, especially when concerning the famous shower scene.  Hitchcock knows how to keep the audience on edge throughout the entirety of the film; thus the publicity campaign `No One Will Be Seated After the Picture Begins'.<br /><br />And then you have the plot, filled to the brim with mystery and surprise.  Hitchcock takes advantage of these plot twists in order to create a film that is genuinely shocking and unexpected (the first go around) and manages to still deliver shivers upon multiple viewings.  I have not read Robert Bloch's novel which served as inspiration for the film (I don't hear many good things about it) but Hitchcock's masterpiece shines brightly from every outlet.<br /><br />The film revolves around Marion Crane, a young woman who has a lot of things going wrong for her; most notably her affair with a married man.  Desiring to find a way to make their lives easier and enable her lover Sam to divorce his wife and marry her, Marion steals a substantial amount of money from her boss's client and flees town.  In her haste she stumbles across an old run down motel and decides to stay the night.  The manager Norman seems like a nice young man.  He's thoughtful and considerate, offering her some dinner and keeping her company.  He is a tad skittish and defensive, but nothing too alarming.  Then Marion attempts to take a shower, and we all know what happens next.<br /><br />I can't for the life of my conclude that anyone reading this review doesn't already know the brilliant twist in this film, for even those who have not seen this movie are certainly aware of it, but for the sake of that one person who genuinely has no clue I will remain silent with regards to the plot from that point onward.<br /><br />Aiding Hitchcock are the phenomenal performances by the cast, especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.  There is a pivotal scene when Norman Bates and Marion Crane are eating dinner together that truly reeks with talent.  These two actors embody the souls of their characters and ooze forth with such commanding presence.  I am shocked that Anthony Perkins was denied even an Oscar nomination for his brilliant performance, creating the perfect villain who is not only fear inspiring and genuinely chilling but also honestly sympathetic.  Janet Leigh, who did receive a much deserved Oscar nomination, is also flawlessly enticing as Marion Crane.  She commands your attention and draws you into her dilemma masterfully.  The remaining cast is superb as well; John Gavin, Vera Miles, John McIntire and Simon Oakland especially delivering strong performances that support and elevate those of the two leads.<br /><br />When all is said and done there really isn't any fault to be found with Hitchcock's masterpiece.  The final frames of Norman Bates' silent madness are forever locked into my subconscious and still haunt my dreams on occasion.  Sure, there are films that are scarier and more gruesome than this classic but rarely has a film of this genre been able to reach the levels of truly sustained dread that Hitchcock captured; a dread that never leaves, only lies dormant, waiting for the right moment to unleash itself its victims once again.

Even more amazing is that it remains so engaging without the typical bug-eyed monsters that populate science fiction.<br /><br />The "human reaction" to the series of unfolding extraordinary events is vividly portrayed, and is so reflective of our modern world. A blitz of media here, a special committee there, a glory seeker, a powerful manipulator, and even a terrorist all appear in this picture - it has them all.<br /><br />The script is very well done, and one of my favorite lines points out how humans are not only capable of beautiful dreams, but also of horrible nightmares as well.<br /><br />The film mentions that the bottom line is that we do not live in a world that is fair, but for this picture the bottom line is that it - including the performance of the wonderful cast - is an extremely fine piece of work from top to bottom.

 | product/productId: 6300251004 | review/userId: AMZYAGVDQWTS | review/summary: Over 200 5-star Reviews vs. Ammy's Editorial Review.  Choose Who You Believe. | review/text: I have loved this 1970 musical version of the old Dickens novel since I was an 8 year-old girl and the staff at my school adopted the song "Thank You Very Much" for one of our school pageants.  This is a charming and magical film with the heart put right into it every step of the way, not to mention that Albert Finney is one of my favorite old school actors.<br /><br />Sure, there were liberties taken, but IT'S A MUSICAL, for crying out loud, and a handsome one at that.  If you don't like musicals, stop reading my review and, in fact, why are you even reading any of the others?  Unlike most musicals, however, this one manages to keep a strong storyline intact, with or without the songs, and nowhere is this made more clear than when Ebenezer Scrooge (Albert Finney), is confronted by the ghost of Christmas future.  Some people have said that this movie tends to be scary, but I think it is more creepy than scary, except for this one pivotal scene.  It is wonderful to see Finney at the top of his game (Isn't that common for him anyway?), as one of the most effective and sympathetic--at times even empathetic--Scrooges to grace filmdom?  I love his portrayal of the old miser from the fact that he's such a tight rich man that he dresses lousy compared to the other rich people you see on the streets, and his house is dark, almost barren, not unlike the man himself.<br /><br />I absolutely love David Collings' performance as Bob Cratchet, which is so well done that you understand how he and his family are richer than Scrooge in their poverty from the outset.  In fact, the entire cast is exceptional, and Alec Guiness gives a darkly humorous performance as the ghost of Jacob Marley that often shows his character's sardonic wit in his resentment of having to lug around a chain he "gets" to warn his former business partner about.  Another actor who impressed me in this adaptation was Kenneth Moore as the Ghost of Christmas Past.  "Come here, you weird little man," always makes me laugh.<br /><br />This movie is just what the doctor ordered if you are getting bah humbuggish about the oversaturation of the holiday's exploitation.  I don't care if turkeys are indigenous to the U.S. as one writer complained.  America could have imported them live to England back in 1860 by boat, now couldn't they, and wouldn't that have looked like an exotic delicacy for the holiday to both rich and poor alike in Victorian England?  Beautiful costumes, and lovely sets only make this underrated holiday treasure more of a delight.<br /><br />Watch for some of the best scenes as Albert Finney plays the young Ebenezer who is engaged to Fezzywink's daughter Isabelle during the beautiful number "Happiness."  This is some of the most gorgeous cinematography in the movie.  That brings up another issue:  Leslie Bricusse's musical score is wonderful and, in fact, I had this movie in last night simply because I wanted to hear "I Like Life!"  How anyone can dismiss this beautifully done musical is beyond me, because I have seen several adaptations of the Dickens novel, and this is my favorite.  Beside that, I bet you can't get "Thank You Very Much" out of your head long after you've finished watching this charming, thought provoking, and well-crafted Christmas gem.

Now, I would be the first to admit that &quot;Brazil&quot; is not everyone's cup of tea, but I am among  those who think it a brilliant piece of cinema -- dark and funny and a  thoroughly enveloping alternative world.  Not only does this edition give  us Terry Gilliam's &quot;final cut&quot; of his movie (with an alternate  audio commentary track from Gilliam), but also the disastrous studio cut  released for syndicated television (the studio failed to even make a sow's  ear out of this silk purse).  And there are two documentaries (one about  making the film and one about Gilliam's battle with the studio over the  movie), plus a great deal of production background material.  A fascinating  compilation of material -- and I would recommend having Jack Mathews's book  &quot;The Battle of Brazil&quot; on hand as well.

I do not believe it is anti-war, but it does capture a portrait of a side of war that you do not witness a lot in movies: the civilians.  <p>We are all familiar with movies like Platoon, Patton, and Black Hawk Down.  These are war movies that we are the most familiar with, and, like with most war movies, focus on the warrior and the persons involved in combat.  Grave of the Fireflies, on the other hand, shows the faces of the people who are innocently caught up in the middle of mankinds politics at it's ugliest.<p>Grave of the Fireflies does not tell its viewers that war is wrong no matter what.  It simply shows the reality of World War 2, which was one of the ugliest wars in world history.  A lot was on the line during that war, and as a consequence the battles were often times brutal and unforgiving, often times resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocents.  <p>Grave of the Fireflies is definitly a must see for anyone who enjoys war films!  It definitly explores an area in war-film that hasn't been explored as much as it should be, and it does an excellent job at showing just how strong the human spirit can be.

 | product/productId: 0784012822 | review/userId: A2RYN6F3519H2Z | review/summary: The best space alien invasion movie ever | review/text: Charlie Sheen is a radio astronomer searching for signals from extraterrestrial life. Shortly after he discovers what seems like a likely signal, and reports it to his boss, he is fired, and blackballed from  academia. He finds a clever and plausible way to continue his research, and  confirms his findings. Soon after, he finds that someone is trying to cover  up his discovery. He finds another scientist who is on to the secret he has  started investigating, and they head to Mexico to investigate  further.<p>Everything the humans in the movie do is plausible. The human  science is sound, and even clever in the case of how Charlie Sheen  continues his radio astronomy. The behavior is reasonable too -- people  show fear when we would be afraid, and make mistakes that seem reasonable  rather than stupid. When they discover useful information, they draw clever  conclusions, without relying on unbelievable reasoning or information they  couldn't know. Charlie Sheen has a few successes -- and failures -- due to  luck, but most of his success come from dedication and intelligence.<p>The  aliens are generally plausible too. Some of their technology is a bit hard  to believe, but don't require unreasonable suspension of disbelief. (Their  disguises are questionable, but important to the plot and more believeable  than alternatives in other movies. The device they used to shut down  Charlie Sheen's follow-up experiments was questionable, but more fun to see  in action than a work gang.) More important, the aliens' behavior is  reasonable. They're very protective of their secrets, which they would have  to be to maintain their cover. Rather than mistakes of overconfidence,  their mistakes result from desire to keep a low profile...<p>It has a bad  direct-to-video sequel, which is present as a mostly worthless extra on one  DVD version of The Arrival. It's just as bad as the stupid but better-known  space alien invasion movie that was released in 1996.

Primarily for one reason...Vincent Price, who is at his hammiest  best as Frederic Loren who along with his murderous wife rent out the House  from alcoholic owner Watson Pritchard. The film seems pretty hokey but its  Price who holds it up. Check him out in William Castles 1959 film &quot;The  Tingler&quot; another Priceless (excuse the lousy pun) classic.
 | product/productId: 0792845773 | review/userId: AERRKUC3HJ75I | review/summary: A guilty pleasure from the 80s | review/text: I've seen this movie probably about 50 or 60 times. It came out when I was a senior in high school and working at a movie theater that showed one movie at a time. DSS played for about 4 months. Hence, the numerous viewings. The movie has never stopped being funny, sweet, and relentlessly entertaining. I still find this movie a guilty pleasure, and I pop it in whenever I'm feeling down and need a pick-me-up. The cast is great: Aidan Quinn and Rosanna Arquette have great chemistry. Madonna is funny and sexy and at this point still has a real woman's body. Laurie Metcalf (as Becky) is simply superb. This woman is a genius and I'll never understand why she isn't a superstar. She has almost all the best lines in the film, and believe me there are many. Steven Wright makes a hilarious cameo. And look for John Turturro. The plot is as silly as they get, but the writing is sharp with tons of quotable lines. The movie is a time capsule of wonderful vintage 80s junk-chic, complete with soundtrack. Watch it and reminisce.

 | product/productId: 0767813871 | review/userId: A1AY6PKVBITY8G | review/summary: Great transfer, marvelous Dolby 5.1 audio, but... | review/text: ... those of you who are lucky enough to own the 1992 Pioneer Special Edition laserdisc release of this classic are going to be disappointed.<p>If you don't own a laserdisc player, take note:<p>This is a superb presentation of the greatest American musical ever produced. Its release on DVD prompted me to finally buy a DVD player. Yes, it's that good. Read the 100+ other reviews here justifiably gushing with &quot;sentimental effusion&quot; about the inferior VHS version. Add a star or two to those reviews. The DVD restores much of the 40 minutes Jack Warner cut from the original theatrical release for running time and political reasons. This is the best this film has ever looked or sounded. The Dolby 5.1 is a special treat; aside from its Radio City debut, the film was always presented in monaural, and the VHS version had the same limitation. Close your eyes and you'll swear you're sitting in the best orchestra seats in the house.<p>Okay. All non-laserdisc owners, stop here and place your order immediately.<p>Now, fellow 1776ers/laserphreaks: Sigh. What a disappointment. But buy it anyway because of its technical superiority to the laserdiscs.<p>I was hoping the DVD would be a repackaging of the laserdisc release, perhaps exploiting the advanced content access features provided by the newer format. Alas, that's not the case.<p>The DVD does have some material not on the laserdisc: screen tests of the actors and a 1776 theatrical trailer, as well as some other trailers from more or less contemporaneous films. There's also a commentary by director Peter Hunt and writer Peter Stone which is quite good, although Hunt's second audio channel interview, by the 1992 laserdisc's producer, Joseph Caporiccio, is somewhat more satisfying.<p>From here on, it's downhill.<p>The laserdiscs had 66 chapter stops. The DVD only has 28.<p>The laserdisc also contained:<p>Overture and Intermission Music which was played in theaters during the 1972 first-run roadshow engagements of the film.<p>A secondary audio channel containing the orchestra-only track, minus the vocals, although you can sometimes hear the actors' voices, picked up faintly by the orchestra mikes.<p>The laser release also has about 14 minutes of footage missing from the DVD, featuring deleted verses from songs, most notably &quot;Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve&quot;, and various pickup and reaction shots.<p>Columbia calls the DVD the Restored Director's Cut, so I'm not going to argue about the missing 14 minutes that were on the laserdisc but absent on the DVD. Who am I to second-guess what Peter Hunt's vision of the film should be?<p>However, I must admit to harboring suspicions the additional laserdisc footage was jettisoned due to its inferior quality. Because the original negatives of the additional scenes were destroyed, the laserdisc contained sections from secondary sources. Some of these sections contained scratches, edit marks, noticeable color and density shifts and even a tiny snippet from a black and white workprint.<p>One can argue that since the Restored Director's Cut is aimed at the general public and not 1776 afficiados, Hunt decided to go with what looked best. The average movie watcher would probably find the extra footage rather jarring and distracting.<p>This is quite understandable. Frankly, the DVD version is the one I'll show to persons unfamiliar with the film. Once I get 'em hooked, though, I'll drag out the laserdics and blow them away.<p>Perhaps Sony/Columbia/Tri-Star/Whatever will release their own special edition in the future, one which will allow you to watch the theatrical version, the current DVD's Restored Director's Cut, and the whole-nine-yards-laserdisc assemblage. Remember how a film would have multiple laserdisc releases? You almost had to build an addition to your home to house all the flavors of &quot;Terminator 2&quot; floating around in the mid-90s.<p>So, you may ask, why give the DVD 5 stars?<p>It's technically flawless and superior to the VHS version by several orders of magnitude.<p>Comparing it to Pioneer's 1992 labor of love is unfair. The laser version had a limited release, was aimed at collectors, has been long out of print and is on an obsolete format.<p>And besides, completists will want it anyway.
 | product/productId: 6300983781 | review/userId: AL4BWE1G9BXJ2 | review/summary: At last! | review/text: I have waited years for this to come out on DVD.  One of my favourite films of all time (if not my favourite), I've only had a very poor copy I taped from the television years ago.  When it was first shown at the Cannes film festival, the critics gave it a standing ovation (totally unheard of).  A beautiful story, wonderfully acted and filmed.  A truly magical experience, so why did we have to wait for so long? - second hand tapes have been changing hands for quite large sums, so its obvious there was a demand for it.<br />Slightly mysterious, but very grounded, the story is touching in many ways.  The basics are spelt out in the other reviews below, so I won't repeat them.  But I will repeat my praises for it- this is a MUST HAVE independant Canadian film, rarely seen at the Cinema anywhere, and surely one of the best films missed by most people.<p>BUY IT NOW.
 | product/productId: 0780622510 | review/userId: AQP1VPK16SVWM | review/summary: Effective and atmospheric thriller | review/text: John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) believes that he's conquered his demons; the man convicted of a series of brutal murders that he hunted and caught has been put to death. Or has he? Suddenly, murders with a very similar MO begin happening. Hobbes gets phone calls from someone he comes to believe is the man he saw put to death? But how could that be? With the help of a sharp linguist (the astonishingly beautiful and talented Embeth Davison) Hobbes discovers that evil doesn't truly die but constantly gets "reborn".<br /><br />An effective thriller director by Gregory Hoblit ("Primal Fear"), "Fallen" does occasionally stretch credibility but, on the whole, it's a gripping and powerful thriller along the lines of "Angel Heart". Mixing elements of "The Exorcist" and ""The Silence of the Lambs", "Fallen" features a sharp performance by Denzel Washington and a strong supporting cast including John Goodman as Hobbes disbelieving partner. Hoblit's direction manages to gloss over some of the cracks in Nicholas Kazan's imaginative screenplay. The incredible craft of the film makes you realize how inept recent thrillers have been.<br /><br />The video quality is very solid although some of the darker sequences do suffer a bit in this DVD transfer. Overall, the image quality is stellar. The audio has very nice presence with the dialogue coming through with clarity and crispness. It's evident that this hasn't been remastered for its re-release. It looks very consistent with the previous edition released to DVD.<br /><br />Although it doesn't any extras, there's a very good commentary track. Featuring director Hoblit, writer Kazan and producer Charles Roven focuses more on the performances, how he tried to bring credibility to the more incredible elements of the screenplay and what was changed along the way from conception to production.<br /><br />If you're looking for a solid, creepy movie to watch this Halloween (though this one isn't appropriate for the kids. It deserves its "R" rating although not quite as much as the much gloomier, darker "Se7vn" another terrific thriller), you may fall for this creepy, effective and atmospheric thriller. Take a walk on the dark side this Halloween and visit those who have "Fallen".

 | product/productId: 6302468027 | review/userId: A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4 | review/summary: Two stories about female bonding | review/text: It was a joy watching Evelyn (Kathy Bates) transforming from an emotional eater to someone wanting to take better care of herself.  Evelyn is a sweet and kind woman, but shows she has a more feisty side in the very funny parking lot scene.<br />It was also a joy watching the relationship between Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) develop.<br />Their relationship provided comic relief and a brighter light that shone over the darker main story.<br /><br />The main story involves two females, Idgy (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) whose friendship began reluctantly and later turns into a best friendship.<br />While their friendship develops, it seems like Idgy is romantically courting Ruth. For example, there's a scene where they're both boarding a train and Idgy reaches her hand down (like a gentleman) to help delicate Ruth onto the train. In another scene, Idgy impresses Ruth by showing her how she can charm bees. When a shocked but charmed Ruth asks her why she did it, Idgy replies, "I did it just for you."<br /><br />A very sweet gesture, but also kind of a romantic, too. There's a scene where Idgy kisses Ruth on the cheek and although they don't make out or anything, it did imply Idgy might be a lesbian...especially since she also doesn't date men and also dresses like a man.<br />Whether the friendship is romantic or not, though, it's a strong one. These women go to great lengths to protect one another when they need it the most.<br /><br />Besides depicting friendship in this movie, slavery is also depicted. White people are shown as both cruel and loving towards slaves (with Idgy and Ruth being on the loving team). One thing that might upset people is seeing slaves depicted as happy slaves enjoying having a master. One slave even sings happily while he works.<br />There's a plot twist involving this same slave that is both clever and disgusting.<br /><br />This movie can be a little slow at times. I understand two simultaneous stories take time to develop, but I still thought the pacing could've been sped up a bit.<br />There were also some inconsistencies, too. For example, in one flashback, Idgy is a little girl and Ruth is a young woman. But in another flashback, both Idgy and Ruth look the same age.<br />Also, the ending implies that Mrs. Threadgoode was actually Idgy all along.  However, in the beginning, Mrs. Threadgoode announced herself as Idgy's sister-in-law...so either she's lying about being Idgy's sister-in-law or she's lying about being Idgy. The ending doesn't clear that up.<br /><br />Also, although Idgy is a genuinely good-hearted and brave person, she's also a smoker, a thief, and a prankster at church which makes it hard to consider her a role model.<br />But overall, though, I consider this a warm-hearted and clever movie.

We both enjoyed it and it held our interest for the duration. I particularly liked the art deco sets, and the 1930's period way of speaking. John Lone plays a great villian. Penelope Ann Miller is stunning as Margo Lane. Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the Shadow and Cranston but I wanted a little more screen time for the Shadow.  I still give it 4 stars because it is a faithful representation of the Shadow radio series which I have listened to on occasion.  The DTS sound is superb. The DVD does not have anything in the way of extra features so I was let down in this respect. The DVD also should be offered in wide screen format because the movie is actually pretty good. A sequel would have been excellent, since a lot of the framework of the Shadow is set up in this movie. Too bad the studio forgot about this movie. My recommendation is to get this movie and pop a batch of popcorn and enjoy!

I found this movie every bit as entertaining, clever, and ingenious as their other films.  The animation and voice talents are superb.  Aside from the jokes and the dizzying chase scene, there are two scenes in the film that are living proof of the power of truly great animation; one, near the end, is absolutely heartbreaking and puts a lump in my throat no matter how many times I see it.  The other is the final image of the film, and it blows my mind to think about how a collection of pixels could carry such emotional resonance.  I say bravo.

It's a good family comedy movie that gets everyone in a good mood.  Chevy Chase does an awesome job as the lead character and Randy Quaid as the unwelcome family member is always a great twist.  The Griswalds just want a great all American family Christmas with the entire family present and enjoying each other.  Just one thing after another seems to sabotage that hope in a funny change of events.

However, I had hoped to get info comparing the many different rebounders available.  The author developed and sells his own rebounder -- which is  not the one I ultimately bought -- so he doesn't give any specific info on others.  It is definitely worth the Kindle price but not what I had hoped to get.

Of all the useless things you can buy before the baby arrives, this DVD is worth every penny.  Even if you get an extra half hour rest, it would be golden. Highly recommend his swaddling technique too, it worked better then the velcro swaddlers we've tried and once you get a hang of it, much simpler (just make sure you buy good (large & breathable) swaddling blankets!! like aden + anais).

For example, the  tools of the craft and how they are used and how they are NOT used, how  Witches do NOT worship the devil, we do NOT hold sexual orgies, and we most  certainly do NOT hold animal sacrifices, etc.. Information about the  various types of Witchcraft, such as Gardner, Alexander, and traditional,  just to name a few is also provided. This one video provides the very  foundation of knowledge that every Witch should have or would want to have.  If you have never bought a single book on Witchcraft, and you are not sure  if it's for you, then don't buy any books until you watch this movie, and  after watching it if you feel that, yes, this religion is for me, and you  feel as if you've come home, then all I can say to you is, Welcome to the  Craft. This movie was worth every penny. Blessed Be.

Lauren and Sandy both show up at the morgue at approximately the same time and discover that they've bother been sleeping with the same man.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Sandy and Lauren to discover that the body in the morgue is not Michael, and they form an uneasy alliance so that they can track Michael down.<br /><br />Honorable mention goes to Frank (George Carlin) for his role as a hippie, living with an Indian tribe in New Mexico.  He had some of the best lines in the movie.<br /><br />When Lauren and Sandy tell Frank that they're looking for a man, Frank misunderstands and assumes that they want to have sex with him.<br /><br />Lauren and Sandy then make it clear that they are looking for a very *specific* man....so that they can kill him.<br /><br />Frank immediately switches gears and exclaims, "Then you'll need a witness!  I saw the whole thing!  It was an accident!  The axe fell out of her hand!"<br /><br />I loved this movie!  Bette Midler, Shelley Long and George Carlin were all fantastic in their respective roles!

 | product/productId: 6301744136 | review/userId: A20NJAPECFGIR9 | review/summary: A True 80's Classic! | review/text: I just saw this film tonight after not seeing it for about twenty years. I was nine when this movie first came out in '86 and as a child it is one of my favorites. Films like Short Circuit are more than just movies for children of the 80's decade. This movie signifies a culture of movies that we could truly identify with and that made the world of 80's cinema unlike anything else Hollywood's ever created.<br /><br />Short Circuit is a gem and if you love family entertainment then you will enjoy and appreciate it. Remember, this was in the mid-eighties before outrageous, computer-enhanced special effects, sex, violence and loads of unnecessary curse words took over the SCI-Fi/Action genre. Still, back then, Johnny Five was before his time. This is as clean as they come and one of the sweetest films ever made. If it weren't for a few curse words this movie would be a G.<br /><br />I'm sure fans of anything 80's will love this movie and have already seen it multiple times. If you haven't, check it out but do not expect Short Circuit to be like the action films of today. It's entertaining, silly and at some points cheesy but that's things we loved about 80's films. So, if you're up for good clean fun then I definitely recommend Short Circuit. And if you're an 80's kid like me, this should be a film added to your DVD collection.

Of course the cast,costums and settings are great. with 60 minutes and 20 million dollars more this movie would have been a great achievement.
 | product/productId: 0792837118 | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: Landmark Musical Shows It's Age | review/text: There are basically two types of musical: the "show" or "classic" musical, in which a loose plot provides an excuse for musical numbers, and the "integrated" musical, in which the plot and musical numbers support each other.  The show musical was standard well into the twentieth century; even so, the shift toward the integrated musical began fairly early in the century, and surprisingly it was Hollywood that led the way.  Among the landmarks in this change was the 1933 HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM, which featured music by Rogers & Hart and which starred the most famous singer of the era, Al Jolson.<br /><br />The story is classic Great Depression nonsense.  While the rich, famous, and powerful struggle with penthouse difficulties, the homeless are cheerful folk who bounce from meal to meal in happy fashion.  The result is a fantasy world in which a Central Park tramp (Jolson) and the Mayor of New York (Frank Morgan) can be friends and social equals.  When a misunderstanding occurs between the mayor and his girl (Madge Evans), the high society girl decides to throw herself off a bridge--and is rescued by the tramp.  The girl looses her memory in the fall, the tramp doesn't know who she is, and the frantic mayor doesn't know where she is.  Needless to say, much romantic and comic confusion ensues.<br /><br />Seen today, there is something intrinsically distasteful in the "happy hobo" construct, which has it that all these homeless folk are just as merry as you and I and don't actually want or need a roof over their heads.  But what makes HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM famous isn't the story line or even the performances: it's the way the movie handles the transition between script and song.  Instead of simply having the actors burst into song, the way is smoothed by a dialogue-like but distinctly musical patter.  It was a novel approach, and it would point the way to everything from THE WIZARD OF OZ to GIGI.  The script by S.N. Behrman is clever and witty, and director Louis Milestone is extremely innovative in his staging.  Yes, HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM was and is an extremely, extremely influential film.  On the other hand, it's not a greatly watchable one.<br /><br />The big problem is Al Jolson (1886-1950), who was easily the single most famous singer of his day.  Trouble was, Jolson was never able to find a way to translate himself to film: he instead plays exactly as if he is on the Broadway stage and has to reach the very last row of balcony seats.  The result is uncomfortably stagy, with lots of eye rolling and you-may-applaud-now moments.  It is incredibly tiresome.  The other performances are alternately tiresome (Harold Langdon) and merely acceptable (Morgan, Evans), the music isn't all that memorable, and in spite of the clever script and Milestone's speed-slick direction the whole thing feels stale.  To add insult to injury, the DVD picture and sound quality isn't all that great.  So, unless you're a hardcore fan who has to trace the roots of the American musical, you might want to give HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM a miss.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer

The story, although fictious was originally written in book form by acclaimed writer Allister MacClain. It would later spawn a follow up movie "FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE" with Robert Shaw & Harrison Ford, and a personal friend Richard Keil. The movie is one of those that catches you up in the story and never lets you go till the climatic end.

I didn't see it as a film about "white middle class rage"; I simply saw it as a film about any person's rage, be they white, black, latino, asian, or any other ethnic group.  There are times I feel like Michael Douglas's character-angry, frustrated, and ready to take out anyone or anything that gets in my way.  Of course, life is too short to be pissed off, which is conveyed at the end
 | product/productId: 630170780X | review/userId: A1KD93LN4BHUT3 | review/summary: Please PLEASE Release This Title On DVD! | review/text: Around every Halloween time, The Wonderful World of Disney aired this Colonial-era masterpiece over three long weeks, keeping us in suspense as to how it would all turn out.  This movie had everything:  adventure, scary costumes(those masks seriously freaked us out when we were little), misty moors, and brave villagers crushed under burdensome taxes struggling against the big bad redcoats.  It was Robin Hood clearly influenced by Zorro!  The lead character---mild-mannered vicar Dr. Christopher Syn by day and the fearsome Scarecrow of Romney Marsh by night---is wonderfully portrayed by the great actor Patrick MacGoohan.  The rest of the cast was solid, too, as was the historical detailing, and the costumes and scenery were nicely done.  The overall theme of the corrupt being exposed and brought to justice was well-handled and lacking in unnecessary melodrama; right prevailed over evil, as it usually did in a Disney film, but this one was more balanced and better produced than many others.  Please, Disney, PLEASE release this one on DVD so our children can enjoy it, too!  The world---or at least us rabid fans of The Scarecrow---will be eternally grateful.

This was our first family experience with Bibleman.<br /><br />This particular DVD provides a LIVE experience of Bibleman. It is showing a production they did before a live studio audience. The theme of the show was Ephesians 6 the full armor of God.<br /><br />The kids gave the movie 2 thumbs up. The adults survived the movie! The acting is not spectacular by any means and the enemy of confusion was well, confusing. But the Biblical content is supreme and the way Bibleman uses the Scripture to fight the enemy is pretty incredible. If your kids like superheros and the Bible then you might want to try out Bibleman. Just expect 1980's acting and effects and you'll be fine!

 | product/productId: 0783241909 | review/userId: A28XEJO7RBWRVR | review/summary: An Astounding movie wich was shamfully overlooked! | review/text: Ride with the Devil is a civil war drama about the kansas/Missuori buskwackers.  It is one of the few movies which takes you into its period world so effortlessly.  It shows the true violence of the time and yet shows how that violence affected people and changed their lives.  Ride with the Devil was directed by Ang Lee, who brought us the brilliant Sense and Sensibility, this is his best work since Sense and Sensibility.  Lee knows how to make a period drama come alive to the viewer in a way that few directors can do.  Maybe its because he usually does projects he really feels for.  The acting in Ride with the Devil was supuerb.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he is the most talented young actor in Hollywood, today. He protrays a a first generation american,Jake Rodell, with such heart and sincerity, very few actors could have done that. Skeet Ulrich delivers his best and most seriuos performance to date, as Jack Bull. Singer, Jewel, gives a suprisingly good and nuanced performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  Jefferey Wright, protrays a freed black with real integrity and authority.  Wright and Maguire were horrible oversights at the Oscars. Actually, i thought the whole movie was a horrible oversight. They brought a whole differnet level to this movie with their performances.  they made you see their characters in a way that few could have done.  You truely cared what happened to them as if they were a close freind.  Wright and Maguire made you see the Civil War not as north and south but as people defending the only life they had ever known.  Ride with the Devil is a captivating movie that goes right to your heart and helps you to understand a time in America's history, when nothing was simple and everything was a battle--Freedom, your way of life and survival.  it puts a new persepective on a war with split our nation in two and hurt everyone it touched.  this movie will probably never get a big following but for those of you reading this you will not be disapointed.  so go rent this movie or be like me and buy it.  thank you Ang lee and everyone how helped make this magnificent movie!

Now, 31 years later, I wondered if I would still laugh just a little...<p>And did I!  What makes screwball comedies so difficult to pull off (and probably why no one does them anymore) is the rare combination of acting talent and timing.  Both are present here.  There are no acting slouches in this film.  One of the true joys of watching the film is the absolutely flawless way in which the characters behave.  It's obvious that director Peter Bogdonavich studied thousands of hours of screwball comedies from the 1930's and early 40's.  It was certainly time well spent.  `What's Up Doc' still holds up as a non-stop, funny, silly, zany, screwball ride from beginning to end.  (And the whole family can watch it!  How many films can you say that about these days?)  To describe the plot would be a waste of time and it would probably spoil the fun, so I'll just say see it for yourself.  Enjoy!

In a world of glamour and celebrity Marron fights to maintain her career and Frank Farmer, her bodyguard, fights to keep her alive.<br /><br />Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluted view that she is invincible.<br /><br />Houston plays a charachter that paralells her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan.  Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career.  Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shinging moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible.  Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role.<br /><br />Bodyguard, although panned by many critics, was extremly successful at the box office both domestically and worldwide.  The 8th highest grossing film of all time, Bodyguard was financially a success for Houston but her acting performance was ignored by critics.  The film has many twists and turns and keeps you guessing.  It is not an Oscar worthy performance by Houston, but highly entertaining!
 | product/productId: 078401020X | review/userId: AIFXFHO2N9WJB | review/summary: Surprising and provocative. | review/text: By now most people are aware of some of the more notorious scenes in this popular 1992 movie about a murder/mystery writer (Sharon Stone) being prime suspect for a string of murders that eerily resemble the death scenes in her novels.  What some people may not know is that this movie actually has a really intriguing story.  I decided to rent this movie one night when not much else was at the rental store and I was in the mood for a mystery movie and the clerk at the rental store recommended the new unrated edition of "Basic Instinct".  At first I was skeptical, I figured it wasn't much for story, just eye-candy, and I wanted a story.  The clerk assured me that it was more than just eye-candy, this movie had an excellent story full of twists that would keep you guessing until the end, so I decided, why not give it a try.  To my surprise the movie was excellent.  Even the most notorious scene in the movie (the interrogation scene) which when talked about sounds like it was a marketing ploy to get plenty of guys in the seats, actually served a purpose in the film by showing the power Sharon's character weilded over men with her sexuality.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is quite superb, especially by Sharon Stone who you never quite know if she's good or evil or simply playing the devil's advocate.  Michael Douglas also does an excellent job of playing a loose-cannon detective who is the lead investigator in the case and gets involved with Sharon's character.  The directing by Paul Verhoeven is also top-notch, possilby his best.<br /><br />So, with all that being said, don't write this movie off as simply another raunchy movie with no story, give it a chance and I'm sure you'll be surprised.<br /><br />"Basic Instinct - The Unrated Director's Cut" contains language, violence, strong sexuality/nudity, and drug references.

 | product/productId: 6300247236 | review/userId: AY12DBB0U420B | review/summary: A Timely Movie In A Time Of Rapid Change. | review/text: Last night I felt like watching a comedy, so I put a "9 to5" DVD on. It starred Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The setting was about 1980 when the country was going through a major realignment of the work force. The male-dominated upper levels of business, scientific or academic employment were under fire for not hiring and promoting enough women and women's role in these establishments was starkly defined. It was an interesting time and this movie fits the situation. All the stereotypes prevail in abundance. The Fonda/Tomlin/Parton trio play the downtrodden women and do an excellent job of it. Gags are plentiful and it makes it fun to look back on that period, if somewhat embarrassing.<br /><br />The movie is well done. The acting is good, if somewhat exaggerated here and there for the purpose of laughs. The direction and filming are good. The three leading actresses fit well together and seem to be having a good time. It's a fun movie to watch. If I had any criticism, it would be that the circumstances have changed so drastically in the past three decades that the humor now seems very dated and somewhat stale. Well, that's the fate of producing a timely movie in a time of rapid change.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Most people who see this movie are either confused or horrified.  The way the book was written and the movie was directed surprisingly makes you cheer for the evil Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  With a serial killer name Buffalo Bill on the loose, Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee is assigned to interview a cannibalistic killer name Hannibal Lecter.  She ends up earning trust in Hannibal and he does to her what he does best: gets into her mind.  <p>Hannibal helped Clarice in finding Hannibal while still driving her to the brink of insanity with his eagerness to know about her troubled past.  Clarice Starling is played by Jodie Foster and Dr. Hannibal Lecter is played by Anthony Hopkins.  Both stars won Best Actress and Best Actor respectively, while the film's director and the film itself also won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture respectively.  This movie will stay in my fourteen year old mind for a while and most who see it face the same dilemna.
 | product/productId: 0792162625 | review/userId: A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ | review/summary: Absolutely great sports movie, but what's up with Moxon? | review/text: The brief synopsis: In West Canaan, Texas, football is life.  The entire city revolves around the religion of football.  The team is led by big-man-on-campus Lance Harbor (Paul Walker).  Along with the typical cast of zany teammates, a maniacal, championship coach named Bud Kilmer (Jon Voigt - awesome in this role), and the backup QB, Jonathan Moxon (Van Der Beek), the team faces and overcomes difficulties.  Team pulls out improbable, far-fetched play to triumph in the end.  Tons of exciting and believable football action sequences.  There has always been something about the movie that troubled me, however - aside from the improbability of finding a football helmet that would fit Dawson's coconut - Jonathan Moxon's character.<br /><br />Mox never studies, yet he's rumored to be in the running for an academic scholarship to an Ivy League University (Brown).  When Harbor goes down early in the season, Mox must step up and be a hero.  With scholarship dreams dancing in his head, Mox had put all of his eggs in one basket.  The only problem is his complete nonchalance and inattentiveness to his studies also leaks into his football.  Despite these deficiencies, he becomes an overnight superstar.  He gets free beer after the game, but it's not a big deal.  Everything up until this point in the movie is fishy, and THIS is where I figured out what was going on.<br /><br />No real controversy to get beer.  Hmm.  Doesn't study school books or play books.  Hmm.  Mox has failed over ten times; he's in his late twenties, been in high school for years, and his receding hairline finally gave him away.<br /><br />The reason he didn't need to read the playbook is because he memorized the plays.  Kilmer has been using the same plays for each of Dawson's last 8 years as a backup!  It appears that Kilmer is frustrated that Mox doesn't read the playbook or pay attention during games, but it's actually because he's sick of seeing Mox on the sidelines.  If he is going to stick around that long, he may as well be an assistant coach.<br /><br />Why doesn't he study in the classroom?  He's auditing the courses!  He's essentially the white Radio, going to class even when it doesn't matter.  He's been applying to Brown for years!  That's why it's so important to him.  He wants to FINALLY move out of his parents' house.<br /><br />In the middle of the movie, he turns down Ali Larter (who should be a megastar because of this scene alone) in a whipped cream bikini.  No way a teenage boy turns that down.  No way.  Why does Moxon?  Two words: statutory rape.  Why is he with Amy Smart?  Because he knows she's the goody-two-shoes, and there is no risk (i.e. no breasts).  How do the guys get into the strip club, let alone get a free ride?  It's on Moxon's credit card; he opened a tab!<br /><br />It all adds up folks.  It doesn't get in the way of making this one of the more imminently rewatchable sports movies of all time, but it definitely adds something to the viewing pleasure.  Even on late-night TV, this is always a must watch - a TEN! - if only to prove my theory once again.

We watched it on TV this morning and I ordered it for her at my earliest opportunity. Bear lets the kids  know that there is no pressure, giving up your diaper is sometimes hard to  do, and it's OK to have accidents. But at the same time, he reminds the  children of the advantages of being potty trained. Loved it! I've already  recommended this to two friends, and the video hasn't even been released  yet!
 | product/productId: 6300183912 | review/userId: A14NTCK68VH00B | review/summary: Correction about the score | review/text: Copland's wonderful score for this film uses as a leitmotif the French classic chanson from the 18th century, Plaisir d'amour. It is this song that Clift sings to de Havilland while they are in the parlor. "Can't Help Falling in Love" has music certainly inspired by this French tune, but Copland too was inspired, esp since the tune is wonderful and the lyrics reflect the theme of the film: the joy of love lasts but a short time, the pain of love lasts all your life.
 | product/productId: 630179821X | review/userId: A2V3P1XE33NYC3 | review/summary: A train wreck | review/text: Before writing a review for "Terror Train," I decided to peruse Jamie Lee Curtis's filmography to test out a theory. I believed that the atrociousness of "Terror Train" likely was the straw that broke the camel's back, thus leading this actress away from her horror film roots and into new territory that she would subsequently mine quite successfully for the next twenty plus years. I think my theory proves correct, at least in part. Before making this movie, Curtis starred in "Halloween," "The Fog," and "Prom Night." After "Terror Train," she made "Halloween II." And that was it as far as horror went until she reprised her role as Laurie Strode in a couple of the latter stage "Halloween" sequels in 1998 and 2002. I compliment her for moving beyond what was obviously posing a grave threat to her burgeoning career, namely her status as a slasher scream queen. If she had kept making horror movies, perhaps starring in a "Terror Train 2" or something similar, we would be reading about her in one of those "Where are they now?" articles. Don't get me wrong; I like Curtis's horror film portrayals in "Halloween" and "The Fog." What I don't like are films like "Terror Train."<br /><br />A truly unimaginative slasher, "Terror Train" sets up its premise early on. A bunch of college freshmen--Alana Maxwell (Curtis), Doc Manley (Hart Bochner), and a couple of other bland faces I can't place at the moment--play a particularly nasty prank on one Kenny Hampson (Derek McKinnon), a geek whose demeanor and appearance practically begs for abuse. Rightly ascertaining that Kenneth hasn't been with a woman, the members of the fraternity he's pledging to send him up to a room where Maxwell awaits his presence. But there's a catch. Alana has no intention of bedding the gullible Kenny, so she hides behind the door to watch him embrace a cadaver those merry fraternity pranksters copped from the medical school. Hampson predictably freaks out, spinning around and around on the bed getting all wrapped up in a bunch of gauzy curtains. Sure, it's a mean spirited prank, but Kenny flips out in a permanent sort of way and heads for a free vacation at the mental motel. Life goes on for Maxwell, Manley, and the rest of the kids involved in the gag until their senior year. It is then that the group rents a train for one last alcohol-fueled bash before moving on with their lives.<br /><br />How is it possible to stage a bloody massacre in the narrow confines of a train? It's not easy, so director Roger Spottiswoode and writer T. Y. Drake throw in a contrived scenario in which all of the kids don costumes while partying the night away. Ahhh, a costume party! See, this way the killer can wear a mask and go unnoticed while he kills his prey! How clever! Anyway, people start dropping almost immediately, with one kid dying outside in the snow while his friends board the train. Once inside, the movie moves about as fast as the train. We're treated to interminable stretches of mind numbing boredom as the camera moves from group to group for bouts of yawn inducing dialogue. A magician named Ken (David Copperfield) shows up to provide entertainment and look and act weird, and a train conductor called Carne (Ben Johnson) ambles about offering sage advice to anyone who'll listen for more than a second. Occasionally the movie reminds us we're watching a horror movie with a relatively bloodless kill or two, but the murders come too few and far between to help this train wreck. Lots of screaming and running around sends the signal that the film is coming mercifully to a close. The end.<br /><br />I'd like to advocate a new policy concerning DVDs right now. For films like "Terror Train," I think Congress ought to pass a federal law requiring a sticker attached to the cover of the DVD case that says, "This movie stinks!" That way I can avoid unpleasant experiences like this one and move on the next load of schlock that much faster. Geez, where to start with the terror that is "Terror Train"? Well, the performances are mediocre, with only Jamie Lee and Ben Johnson turning in anything that smacks of a passing resemblance to acting. David Copperfield, I must say, should never, ever consider appearing in another movie. He's about as lifeless as road kill here, and what's up with that haircut? He looks like he's wearing a motorcycle helmet. But it's not just the performances that sink the film; it's the lack of carnage. What is this, a 'PG' rated film? I saw more blood when I skinned my knee back in the third grade than I did anywhere in this mess. If you're looking for an axe in the head, a machete making a meaty thwacking noise as it enters young flesh, or extended periods of arterial splashing...well, look elsewhere because you won't find it here.<br /><br />The only extra on the disc is a trailer for the film, and for once I'm not complaining. I wouldn't want to listen to a commentary or see behind the scenes footage. The movie is far too boring to merit such special treatment. I planned on giving "Terror Train" one star, but I'm going to kick it up a notch for one scene that actually does manage to work up a bit of suspense and, dare I say, terror. The part in question involves Jamie Lee hiding in a cage screaming her head off while the killer jumps around outside breaking the light fixtures and generally ranting and raving because he can't reach his prey. One scene doesn't redeem the film, however. I recommend giving this one a wide berth--just watch "Halloween" or "The Fog" again if you want to feed your Jamie Lee Curtis cravings.

They cleaned up some of the language, but the worst part is how they changed Billy's death from suicide to an accident. Totally changes the impact of his death. When he screams out "Julie!!" and then stabs himself on stage, it is truly hearbreaking. Regardless, the ending still gets to me.
 | product/productId: 0792835042 | review/userId: AIPSUF99BQ17T | review/summary: Make sure to listen to the commentary | review/text: I have always loved this movie, and I saw it again after many years. It was as deep and well acted as remembered. Jane Fonda, Bruce Dern,and Jon Voight were at their professional and artistic peaks. The details are what made this so compelling, the real Vietnam vets, ( they were not actors), the music, the expressions in the actors' and actresses' eyes...<br />I have to especially commend the men who did the commentary. It is one of my favorite things to do, to re-watch a good movie and listen to the commentary, which often is quite entertaining ( such as the movie Sideways' commentary)or in this case, extremely enlightening and educational.<br />Haskell Wexler, Jon Voight, and Bruce Dern provided the commentary, and while I would have loved Jane Fonda to be included, these 3 proved to be wonderful. They quietly discussed all the aspects of this movie, from the difficulties in lighting, the script and improvisational moments, the interpersonal relationships, the Vietnam vets in the movie and the real basketball players; the purpose of the music chosen, the history of what was going on in the US and why this movie was unique for it's time...I can not stress enough to any of you reading this: Please take time for the commentary. To be able to hear these 3 great artists and to learn about a piece of movie making history... it was engrossing and touching; makes me appreciate the movie itself even more.
 | product/productId: 6300217833 | review/userId: A3NO9S7E0FG6Y6 | review/summary: Far and away the Best version of this opera! | review/text: In my opinion this 1981 production at the Met is easily heads and tails above its 1971 and 1991 competition. First of all it has a wonderful cast who play their roles to comic perfection;Pavarotti himself is in his prime.<br /><br />Secondly,the production design and Nicola Rescigno's treatment of the score capture the rustic, country feel of this Donizetti comedy much better than Levine in the 1991 production which I  had the great fortune to attend. Though that production boasts Kathleen Battle in great voice as Adina, it is a role of a young woman in love and Judith Blegen seems to fit better here. As for the rest of the cast there is very little comparison. Brent Ellis and Sesto Bruscantini give seminal performances here.<br /><br />As far as the 1971 CD version goes, though there is some good singing here and there, I have never taken a liking to Bonynge who I believe had very little understanding of music, but had a great business sense and bedside manner. His treatment of both his wife's singing or a score make nearly any work of his unlistenable for me. Dame Joan had one of the greatest voices ever but couldn't pronounce a lick of what she was singing in most everything she recorded with her husband including the '71 elisir. Pavarotti on the other hand was unimpeachable in this regard.<br /><br />In conclusion, this production is the closest thing to what I think Donizetti must have had in mind when he wrote the score. This also contains beyond any doubt or criticism the absolute BEST recorded version of "Una Furtiva Lagrima" available.

Lead by Frank and Fay (played by real-life couple Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy), the holdouts face thugs who vandalize the building and threaten them all with bodily harm, trying to force them out.<br />In response to Frank's desperate cry for help, a flying saucer two-some come to their rescue.  They help with repairs to the building and help run the restaurant, along with their tiny space-ship offspring.<br />There is heartwarming drama and humor in the efforts of the "visitors" to help mend the old building and the lives of those who dwell within.<br />The special effects are endearing at best, but the over-all movie experience is fun for the whole family.<br />Caution, the building fire scene could be very scary for the little ones.<br />Mary Ann<br />Natchez, MS

However, it had such a great and timeless plot that I didn't know what I was missing.  This film, made in 1970, featured some very dated computer technology but by no means dated sci-fi ideas. An excellent story about what can happen if you turn running your country over to a computer with artificial intelligence, give it the "go/no decision" on use of weapons but no plug to pull when things go very wrong. I recommend this movie for all sci-fans, students of "AI", "consciousness" or sentient computers. This was a great film and extremely well done and thought out for 1970.

 | product/productId: 0767815351 | review/userId: A2IS16K96YSFDV | review/summary: 'I'm Billy Hayes...At Least I Used to Be' | review/text: Based on a true story, the 1978 film "Midnight Express" stars Brad Davis as Billy Hayes, a young American who is apprehended while attempting to smuggle two kilos of hashish out of Turkey in the early 1970s.<br /><br />Despite his hopes of an early release, Billy is convicted and spends years in a hellish Turkish prison.  When they realize their sentences will stretch on for many more years, Billy and fellow inmates Jimmy (Randy Quaid) and Max (John Hurt) plot escape when they face sadistic guards and an environment so brutal that the law of the jungle prevails and many of the prisoners are driven insane.  A couple of the scenes are absolutely not for the faint of heart, and I can now understand why I was not allowed to watch the film on cable when I was nine years old.<br /><br />"Midnight Express" is a Seventies classic--it was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, and its soundtrack produced a Top 40 hit, Giorgio Moroder's "Chase."  The DVD set for this unforgettable film comes with a booklet that discusses the production of the movie, and the DVD itself contains the original preview of the film.  "Midnight Express" is a searing examination of the depths to which man can fall but also of the tremendous inner resources that some possess in the face of extremity.

 | product/productId: 6302212529 | review/userId: A1WZ15MXASDZQB | review/summary: My favorite Disney movie! | review/text: This is my all time favorite Disney movie, I loved this movie so much I used to watch it all the time when I was little.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is that it has a good pace, it tells a long story in a short amount of time, by skipping out on things that probably would have made more sense, but would have slowed the movie down.<br />One might think "What does Eric and Ariel see in each other? They just fall in love and live happily ever after?"<br />I can imagine of utterly boring this movie would have been, having you forced to see those characters explain and show how much they love each other.<br />Instead, it's love at first sight, you kind of guess Eric's personality (though it's obvious he's kind and brave), and it dosen't slow the movie down, and they do add the romantic scene "Kiss the girl" to really show Eric and Ariels love for each other. "Kiss the girl" is so beautifully animated, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.<br /><br />The music and the songs really stands out in this movie, I used to sing-a-long with "Under the sea" when I watched it, nowadays I always choose "Part of your world" when I sing. That song is so dreamy, so perfect and tells the story that just because you got a lot of fancy stuff dosen't mean you are happy. "Kiss the girl" is also a very good song, it suits perfectly with the beautiful scene.<br /><br />And to not make this a sappy love-story (like Pocahontas), there is some scary stuff in this movie. The ending battle is without a doubt the best painted parts of the movie, I can't even imagine how many hours was spent drawing that scene!<br /><br />It's a good story, great songs, loveable (and not lovable Ursula) characters and beautiful animation.

It is not as intense as the first. Nor is it as insightful as the second. The aim this time around is simply to have fun, and it meets that goal very well.<br /><br />Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should. Kristanna Loken is a welcome addition to the pantheon of terminator models, becoming both very sensual and very eerie.<br /><br />You may feel that the movie should have done more to deal with the concepts of fate and free will, like was discussed in the previous movie, but if you merely want to watch a movie that has great effects, great action and passably charismatic characters, you could do worse than this movie.

On the 1.85:1 side, you lose bits not only from the left and right of the original print, but from the top and bottom as well!!!!!<p>The film itself, of course, is brilliant, one of my 10 faves, and stunning even when seen in its old 1.33:1 ratio. Just don't watch the fake widescreen version -- and write to WB immediately to demand they release a proper edition of this classic!!!!!!

Quotes like that are what this movie (and the video games in which it is based) is going to be remembered for.  I decent action film based on the successful Mortal Kombat fighting games the movie is focused on, you guessed it, "Kombatants" punching each other around trying to win an inter dimensional tournament to save the world from the evil Emperor.  About as scary as playing a game of Space Invaders, but you don't go to see a movie like Mortal Kombat and expect anything more then the title implies.  Plenty of action and a plot so simple that there is no brain required to watch this film.<br /><br />The plot centers on three Kombatants who the thunder God - Lord Raydon - believes will decide the fate of the earth.  During the course of the tournament they face a series of warriors possessing supernatural powers who are commanded by the Emperor's evil sorcerer Shang Tsung.  As the tournament goes on the face stronger opponents, including the red-eyed Kano, the ninja attire wearing Sub-Zero and Scorpion, the four-armed champion Goro, before they take on Shang Tsung himself.<br /><br />A short film, barely going over ninety minutes Mortal Kombat certainly does what it intended to do and with a fair level of success.  The constant action and laughable dialogue will no doubt entertain teenagers and just make for a fun late-night movie for casual viewing.

 | product/productId: 0784011370 | review/userId: AIHA1HTAIR3O2 | review/summary: Looks and sounds great! | review/text: The Blu-ray version of this looks amazing.  I bought the "ultimate edition of the standard DVD a few years ago and this looks notably better - even compared to the former's image being upscaled.  This is is the type of picture I expect out of Blu-ray.  Not being a Hi-def rocket scientist, I can't speak too much for the sound quality other than it sounds great.  I don't have the euipment to process DTS-HD, so I can only assume that it sounds better than what normal DTS provides.  The extras on the disc are the same as on the ultimate edition DVD, so you're not losing out on anything like in some of the other Blu-ray ports.  My only complaint is this:  Lionsgate has got this thing for having the pop-up menu take up most of the screen.  Given that the other studios have gone with a nice, low-profile menu that only appears at the bottom, I hope that Lionsgate will adopt this practice sometime in the near future.  Other than that, if you're a fan of 'First Blood' I can easily reccomend this disc.
 | product/productId: 0783236352 | review/userId: A2HJB9J5O5CLPB | review/summary: An Excellent Murderer | review/text: Teresa Wright, innocent young woman, lives with her Betty Crocker, mom, Patricia Collinge and her bank clerk dad.  He's a detective murder enthusiast, Henry Travers.  Then there's Dad's creepy pal, Hume Cronvn, with various recipes for poison.  A young bespectacled sister and goofy little brother complete the family circle.  Indeed, Wright is just off the set from her Mrs. Miniver performance.  The virginal attitudes, the very real naivet&eacute; of 1940's small town, middle class girlhood never to be seen again, contrasts with the, ah, insertion of evil.<br /><br />Uncle Charlie shows up, the beloved, world traveling, younger brother of weepy mom.  Actually, he's on the lam because his apparent wealth is accumulated after affairs with wealthy widows.  Since these women had ended up in the morgue, the young detective, Macdonald Carey is on Joseph Cotton's trail.  To get information, Carey romances Wright to get the goods on the Uncle.  Hence, a confusing romance ensues, but can she give the detective information on her mother's favorite.  It gets easier as Wright starts to get the picture.<br /><br />This is Hitch's first American production and he certainly seems to enjoy the more expensive production values.  The town of Santa Rosa literally pulls all the stops for the fat man. In those days, folks lived a block from the town business center.  This is the same area where today there are crumbling buildings and high crime rates.  In the forties, the middle class lived there, wandering the streets, walking to the library, strolling to the bank, or the local bar without a look over their shoulders. But watch out!  Joseph Cotton, an excellent strangler, may be behind you.

 | product/productId: 0767800141 | review/userId: A2TOU0N8XE68W4 | review/summary: Interesting Modern Turn On The Old Vampire Legend | review/text: I've always had a particular fondness for this film which I believe was a "first" in a lot of ways in 1972, but rather sadly it seems to now be regarded as a bit of a joke by alot of modern audiences more's the pity. Released in early 1972 just as the Vampire cycle of films in both America and England was coming to a close "Blacula", provided a unique twist on the Vampire legend and presented us with a very urbane black Vampire played by deep voiced William Marshall. His vampire is ultimately quite a tragic figure when you learn the facts of how he got to that state and Marshall in his performance is not only up to carrying on the vampire legend but also manages to depict his character for most part in a highly sympathetic light that breathed life into the old legend.<br /><br />"Blacula", begins it's story in 1780 when the elders of an African race send one of their princes Manuwalde on a special mission to Transylvania to seek out Count Dracula's assistance in putting an end to the illegal slave trade which is being carried out by westerners in their country. Unfortunately Manuwalde and his beautiful wife Luva (Vonetta McGee)do not find a sympathetic audience in the Count who proceeds to attack Luva and when Manuwalde goes to her defense he finds himself knocked out by Dracula's followers and placed in a coffin with Dracula then placing the curse of the undead upon him and closing him up in a sealed chamber of his castle for all eternity. The story then shifts forward to 1972 when Dracula's Castle is being emptied of its contents and two antique dealers purchase not only some of the antiques but as a curio the coffin which holds the undead remains of Manuwalde. Shipped back to Los Angeles the coffin is opened and Manuwalde begins his reign of terror killing both of the young antique sellers. Stalking the streets for fresh victims for his blood lust Manuwalde comes across young Tina who is the absolute reincarnation of his long dead wife Luva and he begins a frantic courtship of her in the hope of getting his beloved wife back. The murders of Los Angeles residents however continue with the same suspicious bite marks appearing on the victims. These arouse the suspicions of Tina's brother in law Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), who begins to connect the strange Manuwalde with the murders. When night club photographer Nancy (Emily Yancy), is killed just as she is developing some photos of Tina with Manuwalde the finished film when discovered by Dr. Thomas reveals a blank space where Mamuwalde was standing which further implicates him. Now that Dr. Thomas knows Manuwalde's real identity, the chase is then on to track him down and keep him away from Tina. She however has fallen in love with the Prince and has completely fallen under his spell. After a scary encounter with Manuwalde and his disciples in a disused warehouse the doctor and police track down his resting place to an electric plant where in the ensuring fight Tina is mistakedly shot. Laying her to rest the broken hearted Manuwalde sees no purpose in continuing and in the ultimate sacrifice evades his pursuers and runs up onto the roof into the early morning light allowing himself to disintergrate into dust in time honoured Vampire tradition.<br /><br />Passed off as trendy and dated hip action by today's audiences I find this story an original and interesting one. William Marshall as the cursed Blacula of the title does an outstanding job in the role of the tormented man with the curse of the undead on him who sees a chance at second happiness. His vampire while undoubtedly savage and blood thirsty is allowed to display his sadder side in particular in his scenes with Tina over the losses he has experienced in life. Vonetta McGee in the two roles of Tina / Luva also gives a great performance as the young girl drawn to the mysterious stranger who claims she is his wife brought back to life despite knowing what he actually is. Most of the black characters depicted in "Blacula", are surprisingly postive ones with Dr. Thomas played by Thalmus Rasulala being a medical investigator who is always two steps ahead of the police in their investigations. The only dated characters in the otherwise intelligent story are the two antique dealers that are unfortunately depicted as gay stereotypes but apart from that it is a pleasing film in the acting department. The 1970's feel to the story is well presented and the flashback beginning at Dracula's Castle is also top quality. One of great strong points of "Blacula", is the amazing and quite frightening vampire makeup applied to William Marshall which is highly effective and on a much more savage side than that used by Hammer studios for their vampire creations. The film abounds with many eerie and quite frigtening moments such as the female Cab driver (Ketty Lester), rising from the dead in the Morgue and attacking the night worker (Elisha Cook), Manuwalde's transformations into a Vampire Bat, his attack on the photographer in the dark room and the attack in the Warehouse are all standout scenes that earn "Blacula", its proper place in modern horror circles. Very seventies in its feel and choice of accompanying music that is part of "Blacula's", charm and are elements which we as an audience almost 30 years later should not be too judgemental about.<br /><br />Being a great fan of vampire films I believe that "Blacula", is a worthy late edition to the Vampire horror movie group along with the also interesting "Count Yorga, Vampire" of the same period. Today it is certainly viewed as one of the best of the blaxploitation cycle of films so popular in the early 1970's, and it was succesful enough to have its own sequel the following year with William Marshall resurrected in his famous role as Mamuwalde in "Scream Blacula Scream".  "Blacula", contains some humour and is well balanced in its storytelling and in its horror elements making for very entertaining viewing if you are a fan of this genre. Sit back and enjoy possibly the first black vampire to grace horror movies in William Marshall who with his regal bearing and deep sensual voice creates a most interesting vampire character that is really this stories chief asset. Enjoy!

This wide-screen version allows you to see it as it was originally shown in theaters in all of its spendor.  So grab your popcorn and settle in for a great motion  picture treat. Adam (Howard Keel) brings home his bride (Jane Powell), who  thinks she is finally going &quot;to cook for just one man&quot;, to a  mountain cabin filled with his six younger brothers.  The six boys, naive  due to lack of education in the finer things of life, are taught by their  new &quot;big sister&quot; how to dance and court a girl.  Adam read in one  of his new wife's two books about the Sabine women who were carried off by  the Romans.  When he told his brothers about this, they decided to try this  method of betrothal for themselves.  So they went on a bride roundup.  They  ended up snowed in for the winter with the girls, but no brides.  Somebody  forgot to bring the parson! The story is full of fun, frolic, singing and  dancing galore.  Everyone in the family has a treat in store when they  watch &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.&quot;

Not that I thought that particular creature would ever be real, but something that Mankind had never met up with might be out there.  Heck HIV Aids was barely heard from then.  It came from Africa.  Who knows what might be lurking in space.<br /><br />Anyhow Sigourney was "hot", the action fast and furious. A true delight to watch.  I'd invite people over to the house just to watch the movie and get their reaction.<br /><br />Alien is, quite simply, one of the best movies ever made in both the sci-fi and horror genres.<br /><br />The film hasn't aged a bit since it came out in the 1970's. The DVD is great too, with excellent picture quality and a really great commentary track<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Science Fiction, horror movies and horror classics.<br /><br />Gunner January, 2007

Who'da  thunk it??? | review/text: I'm not going to attempt to compose a brilliant summary of this extraordinary film.  Others have done an excellent job of that already.  I merely wish to add my voice to those proclaiming "The Lion In Winter" as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Even if the script WERE less than brilliant, a cast such as this could most likely win awards just reading aloud from the Peoria, Illinois telephone directory.<br /><br />Oh, and just in case you wonder what relevance this historically based film might have for us today, consider that it was John [eventually crowned king] who signed the "Magna Carta" in the year 1215.  This document was the first in British history in which a king agreed [admittedly under great pressure] to limit his monarchic power.<br /><br />This, then, became the cornerstone of what was later to emerge as England's limited parliamentary monarchy and that of other nations as well.  It further becomes the inspiration for limited government in general and more specifically for that republic that was to eventually emerge in the colonies across the big pond, so to speak.<br /><br />Consider also that Richard was to go on and become King Richard II, famous for his crusades to the Holy Land.<br /><br />Relevant today?  You BET.  And never was learning history so enjoyable as this film makes it.
 | product/productId: 6301914090 | review/userId: A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ | review/summary: All revved up with no place to go | review/text: Days of Thunder is an entertaining film boasting a great performance by Robert Duvall and a few exciting, albeit semi-ludicrous, racing scenes.  As a whole, though, this film chugs along near empty, lacking any real oomph.  Tom Cruise plays reckless upstart Cole Trickle, a race car driver who has decided to make the jump from Outlaw and open wheel racing to stock car racing.  Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) is the former car builder and crew chief that used car salesman and new car owner Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) wants to bring on board to work with Trickle.  Trickle is as wild on the track as he is off, and all of the talent he definitely has seems wasted as he and Harry are almost completely incapable of communicating with one another.  Eventually, there's a breakthrough, and Cole wins a few races.  At the Firecracker 400 in Daytona, though, Cole is involved in a major wreck along with his nemesis Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker).  It is here that Nicole Kidman enters the picture as Cole's doctor Claire Lewicki.  Cole's recovery from the crash involves more than just physical healing, and there's a new, thoroughly sleazy upstart in the circuit whom Cole must now contend with.  There's an interesting yet unfulfilled subplot about Rowdy's injury and his way of dealing with it as well as a romantic theme that basically goes nowhere; clearly, the action on the track is what the filmmakers were banking on in terms of the movie's success.<p>NASCAR wasn't as big back in 1990 as it is now, but even then you didn't have to grow up in NASCAR country like I did to see how ridiculous most of the racing action in this film was.  Anyone with no knowledge whatsoever of stock car racing would get the impression from Days of Thunder that the whole point of driving is to wreck all the other cars.  These cars spend an inordinate amount of time crashing and banging each other as well as the wall, yet amazingly enough battered old wrecks easily catapult themselves back into the top five.  The damage these cars sustain would wreck the aerodynamics to such a degree that they couldn't keep up with the pace car in real life.  Even still, the scenes can prove a little exciting, especially the big finish back at the Daytona 500.<p>As a loyal fan of the late Dale Earnhart, this movie makes me feel a little weird because part of the storyline involves a driver being killed at the Daytona 500 the previous year.  It's also a little strange to watch Nicole Kidman, as she really didn't seem to offer very much on screen this early in her career.  Her Australian accent is more pronounced than it is today, and her hair was still all frizzy in the way that made me question why Tom Cruise was so attracted to her in the first place.  I think Tom and Nicole may have originally met on the set of this film (but I could be wrong about this), and oddly enough their onscreen relationship seems to have no spark of life whatsoever.  Days of Thunder isn't a bad movie at all, but it's nothing to scream about either.  I would offer a word of advice to future viewers of the film; you would do well not to watch the film alongside a NASCAR fan because he/she will likely get on your nerves explaining over and over again how unrealistic the racing scenes really are.

I saw it for the first time last night and its comparable to 'The English Patient' in more ways than one. Undeniably, it is Meryl Streep who holds the film together, as the supporting cast does her no favors. The direction is superb and the background score is very captivating. Universals' DVD presentation of the film is commendable, complete with an hour long documentary called 'The Song of Africa' which documents the crews' travails in the dark continent and also gives one some insights on how the film made it from page to screen.<p>However, Robert Redford ruins most of the film with his dull uninspired take as a British expatriate living and trekking in South Africa. I have never particularly liked any of this mans' performances, and his role here only serves to reiterate that he is one of the most overrated American actors of all time. I can even imagine Tim Curry or Danny DeVito doing a better job here than he does. His character is supposed to be British. Why on earth does he then sound as if he just stepped off a trailer in Mobile, Alabama? Did Mr. Redford do no research on this part? This is truly unpardonable and one of the reasons why I have to ultimately give this film only three stars. And they all belong to Meryl.<p>Mildly recommended.

 | product/productId: 0783241038 | review/userId: A2OSERGXBYMPJ0 | review/summary: &quot;That Was a Hell of a Thing&quot; | review/text: Sometimes you're taking a chance when the only description in the review on the front of a DVD box is the single word, "Funny." Is it "ha-ha" funny or "my soda tastes funny, try it" funny? Fortunately Galaxy Quest delivers more than great laughs, it has well-done special effects, good writing and characterization, and acting that's well above average. Tim Allen does a good job of distancing himself from the Home Improvement Tool-Man character, while Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman portray their characters with a vulnerability they don't usually show in their more commercial work. Tony Shaloub is excellent as always.<p>Plot-wise, Galaxy Quest is little more than "The Three Amigos in Space" (of course, Star Trek was pitched as &quot;Wagon Train in Space,&quot; so perhaps the similarity is apropos). It does enough new and differently with the premise, however, to make this a good film in its own right. The inclusion of the Sci-Fi convention fanboys in the climactic scene was hilarious, and at the same time managed to ring true. Cmdr. P.Q. Taggart, having to fight the twin El Guapos of the alien, Sarris, and egomania - well, that's one more El Guapo than The Three Amigos had, isn't it? <p>There are a few bonuses on the DVD, but an actor and/or director commentary would have been nice, too. The Thermian audio track is of the native Thermian squeaking variety, not the mis-inflected English spoken most frequently in the film. Usually deleted scenes are cut for a reason: they're not very good. Several of the extra scenes on the DVD, however, could have been included in the final release without any problem (one clears up a continuity problem involving Sigourney Weaver's uniform zipper). The "making-of" documentary is nice. The cast/crew bios are good and provide a nice little Easter Egg Hunt, as well.<p>I really enjoyed this movie. More than just funny, it's clever and witty, too. If the DVD packaging is ever redesigned, that's three words they can put on the cover. Check it out.
 | product/productId: 0780630157 | review/userId: A3PHTB9X7B11XL | review/summary: Sappy but fun | review/text: This is a truly sappy musical; the sophistication in RKO musicals was a year away.  But the film is a lot of fun, in large part because of the generally good music, slightly awkward musical numbers, the stunts, and the uncensored shots of lots of beautiful girls.  Indeed, this movie may well have hastened the introduction of meaningful film censorship in 1934.  Fred and Ginger don't, in fact, do very much together, but in retrospect you can see what's coming.  As for stars Delores Del Rio and Gene Raymond: well, the silents are still haunting the talkies in the very early thirties, and here is a case in point.  The scene on the beach after the forced airplane landing is embarrassing.  That sort of thing would quickly disappear from the major studios.  So sit back, relax, and wait for the airplane dancing scene.  Sappy but fun.

According to the movie, sex, grief, and anger are more valuable than pleasantness.

The blu ray is a noticeable improvement over the DVD in many scenes, especially<br />when Lazarus is raised from the dead. I definitely saw<br />more distinct visual information, which greatly magnified the effect of this scene.<br />I have seen the DVD version at least twice in the last<br />year. I would not hesitate to buy this blu-ray again, though it is telling that Fox/MGM says they<br />used the best elements "available", not the best in<br />existence.<br />As for the carping about cameos of great stars ruining the picture, add up the screen time for John Wayne and Shelley Winters (who seem to engender the chief complaints). I'll bet you'll find that, where they are distinctly visible or actually speaking, it adds up to less than two minutes in a film over three hours long, even in the cut version.<br /> George Stevens is an icon among directors. He did not become a fool overnight because he decided to make a picture about the life of Christ. He knew how to downplay the cameos, and to exact wonderful performances from virtual unknown(at the time) actors. This movie gets better<br />with age, and with subsequent viewing, as Stevens<br />apparently knew that it would.<br />I give it four stars because it has not been restored,<br />a restored version probably would have rated five in<br />my book. It is not a movie I would want to be without,<br />even on a less than perfect blu-ray.

One of Hollywood's most perennial delights, this is a great film any which way you slice it.  When showgirl Bonnie Lee (Arthur) is docked via her ship in the banana republic of Barranca, she's delighted to met two American flyers: Joe Souther and Les Peters (Noah Beery, Jr. &amp; Allyn Joslyn).  They fly for a cut-rate airline owned by softhearted Dutchy (Sig Rumann).  The airline is run by hard-boiled Geoff (Grant) who, despite hazardous weather conditions, must maintain a regular flight performance in order to obtain the mail subsidy.  Geoff is rather misogynistic because of a previously sour romance with another gal: Geoff's best friend Kid (Thomas Mitchell) tells Bonnie to keep away from him.....There's obviously much more to this exhilerating Columbia film which was originally entitled PLANE NO. 4.  Based upon a story fragment in which director Howard Hawks wrote in 1938 entitled PLANE FROM BARRANCA.  Hawks said that he conceived the idea for the story while he was flying with a Mexican bush pilot around Mexico.  Lightweight leading man Robert Sterling made his motion picture debut here.

It was nice to have a good guy who didn't go around his boss and take things into his own hands.  It was a more realistic compared to most action movies where the hero walks across everyone around him because he is right and they are all wrong.  Good movie.
 | product/productId: 0767809378 | review/userId: AO4J90YPX5RU6 | review/summary: Ricci is peachy! | review/text: Ricci aside I thought Lisa Kudrow was a delight playing the oppisite of her well known ditzy blonde "Friends" type cast, which helps her to not become to much of a type casted actress. She does have range. I fully enjoyed this movie. I loved the characters, the offensive (to many) script, the well balanced comedy mixed with drama. This film moves you, makes you laugh, think, and truly has you wanting to reach into your television to strangle some if not everyone. Christina Ricci "She's the human tabloid." is all attitude and no graduate as DeeDee Truitt a 16 year old girl that refuses to grow a heart of gold even for us the veiwers. Thats cool we see that type of stuff everyday in the movies. After her stepfather kicks the bucket she decides to go and live with her brother. He, who is moaring his lovers death welcomes her. One might say that was a huge mistake on his part. She does little more than ruin his teaching career, steal his new boyfriend, gets him involved in a gay sex scandal involving a former student where he teaches (thus, the reason for his almost termination), okay what else... steals his dead lovers urn containing the mans ashes. Oh and thats just the half of it. Let's finish this... "The Oppisite of sex" is what DeeDee wants. SEX involves relationships, deceases, pregnanies and other complications in ones life. Who want's that? The film also addresses the survival of the species topic. It's true if we didn't love sex (complications aside) we would have died out aeons ago. Good move on God's part. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by adults that aren't easily offended.
 | product/productId: 0783235666 | review/userId: AJ9W09EUQPAKE | review/summary: The Taming of the Shrew | review/text: What a great conceit to use birds in a horror film. The potential for looming danger is ever present. On crowded urban streets people are always ducking, flinching reactively when a pigeon swoops low. Of course they never get hit - but they could. And you can imagine how unpleasant it would be to be attacked by birds - nasty, feathered guerrilla attackers, all up close pecking and sharp pinching and cutting of the skin. Bloody, and not pleasant.<br /><br />Hitchcock deploys the bird theme to magnificent sci-fi effect in this movie.  Melanie Daniels pursues caddish bachelor Mitch in Bodega Bay, a small Northern Californian community. Flitting across the bay after secretly delivering some lovebirds to him, she is swooped on by a gull and pecked. Then attacks by various species of birds grow, ever stronger, more mysteriously and more dangerously. Lives are endangered, people are terrified, the homely superstitious residents of Bodega Bay look to the mysteriously icy blonde Melanie Daniels and wonder what she is doing here, and why did the attacks start when she came to town?<br /><br />This film does not end with clean, satisfactory meanings or resolutions. There are several symbolic motifs that could be explained in a number of ways. Lydia, Mitch's mother, in a way is the most curious character in the film, her role seems to parallel the bird attacks in many aspects - her hawk like suspicions, her careful guarding of Mitch and attacks on people who try to get close to him like the tragic Annie Heyworth. The famous last scene features birds rippling and gathering ominously, but they do not attack.<br /><br />What happens? Melanie seems to have been subdued, her haughty arrogance and self confidence blown away. Is she a better person? Why the bird attacks? Will they continue? This is a movie that gets under the skin, and poses more uncomfortable questions than it answers.

 | product/productId: 1558802533 | review/userId: A11PTCZ2FM2547 | review/summary: A Masterpiece of a Masterpiece | review/text: Talk about the legacy of acting legend Gregory Peck.  This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUKA">Captain Ahab</a> and Atticus Finch.  (And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)  With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timeless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061120081">novel</a>.  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.<br /><br />For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

 | product/productId: 6301978226 | review/userId: A15YPJLKLZS0MK | review/summary: A Further Decline in the Series | review/text: Well the firsr Rocky movie is one of the best films ever made and even won an Oscar for Best Picture. The second entry became predictable but was still very good as Rocky wasit look like ba ad guy despite an impressive performance by another real life actor and American icon, Mr.T in a role as Clubber Lang who quickly moves up the ranks and gets a shot at Rocky. Rocky was a successful champion the whole time as the film successfully tries to suspend your disbelief by implying Rocky defended the title the whole few years between this and the second Rocky film. When watching movies it is important to get glued to it like in the first Rocky to where it makes you feel emotional, that you got your money's worth, all 2 or 3 bucks of it. Not even an appearance by Hulk Hogan in his role as Thunder Lips can help but make this look like a ho hum third entry in the series that was just meant as entertainment for the night and a cash in by the makers of this film the first one was such an excellent film. I'd hate to only give this 3 out of 5 stars but it's way too fast paced- for a one hour and 30 minute movie it seems like it only lasted 45 minutes it went by so quick. Mick dies sadly and Apollo becomes Rocky's friend. 3 stars is not a bad movie- I do enjoy seeing the further devolpment of the Rocky character it just can't help but seem like a deliberate money making cash in by the makers of this film on the power of the first entry.

This is Chevy Chase's best performance as Clark Griswold.  He perfectly mixes the goofiness of the character with a touch of sentimentality that all successful Christmas movies have.  Clark wants to have the perfect family Christmas and of course his carefully detailed plans go awry.  There are some hysterical scenes involving hanging Christmas lights on the house and shopping in a downtown Chicago department store.  The cast are all funny and the film is worth watching for Mr. Chase alone.

 | product/productId: 6302101743 | review/userId: A10Q8NIFOVOHFV | review/summary: Minor film from Ray Harryhausen. | review/text: A struggling Wild West show discovers dinosaurs on the loose in Mexico, and decides to exploit the discovery. The true star of this movie is the stop-motion animation done by the master of non-computerized special effects, Ray Harryhausen. Crisp color photography adds to the pulse-pounding scenes of prehistoric predators. The production problems of this movie help explain its lack of commercial success. A weak script and wooden acting also detract from the enjoyment. The plot drags and takes too long to get to the "monsters of the lost valley" part. Once the special effects kick in, things get more lively. The scenes of riders roping Gwangi are thrilling. The show-ring battle, however, between Gwangi and the elephant is not up to RH's usual excellent standards. The elephant is obviously an animated model. The segment copies an earlier RH film, "20 Million Miles to Earth." Gwangi rampaging through the Mexican town recalls King Kong rampaging through the streets of New York, but the comparison ends there. The spectacular fire in the great cathedral is an exciting visual display. Dedicated collectors of classic sci-fi films or steadfast fans of Ray Harryhausen will want this one for their collection, regardless. ;-)

 | product/productId: 6300146030 | review/userId: A1COYZSZP13T6J | review/summary: A Wonderful Movie based on a Wonderful Book | review/text: I never saw this film in the theatre.  I saw it on TV many years ago and was enchanted with the medieval setting.  I just recently got the DVD when I remembered the movie due to discussion of the book on an internet board I post on.<br /><br />All I can say is that I am in awe of the work done by the director in bringing the book to the screen.  The visuals alone express exactly the sense and the setting that Eco took pages and pages of info dump to allude to.<br /><br />The size of the whole complex with small poorly clad men scuttling over it at the mercy of the weather accurately places man (in the understanding of the time) between cruel and capricious nature (i.e.: godlessness) and being dwarfed by the immense buildings dedicated to god, which represent his power and importance in the world, and the puny stature of man.<br /><br />The dark interiors, lit only by fire highlight the fear, superstition and lack of education and outside contact that the average 'simple' person had.  It made real the poverty and the terror and the precarious hold on life the people had, and how they would grasp at anything that promised safety and salvation.  How it was so easy to believe in demons, and witches and other physical manifestations of their hard life. The strange look of the monks also represents the difficulty of surviving unscathed by disease, or accident.<br /><br />At the ending of the medieval period the church had grown into a fat, rich, bloated institution more interested in temporal matters, and internal minutia (angels dancing on the head of a pin) than on acting as shepherds to god's flock.<br /><br />The movie shows the Benedictine monks, the caretakers of the monastery and local flock, as those who started with a good heart, yet who uphold the status quo in fear rather than love.  Because the times have changed, the flock's needs have multiplied, and the monks have not, they end up going through the motions of the religious life during the day, with venality creeping in during the dark hours:  Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, Acquisitiveness, and Selfishness.<br /><br />Rather than copy and disburse books to uplift the darkness they hide them away, and prevent the spread of learning; keeping the knowledge as secret treasure for the select within the monastery.  There are gradations of the select within the walls, leaving the monks in competition to become 'more select', rather than focusing on the needs of their flock, and god's work. All they do is dump refuse through their sewer and make the people scramble like animals to survive.<br /><br />This is the setting upon which the future role of the church and god's place in man's affairs is to be debated, in the guise of the question `was Jesus poor? `  Where the regular church people are too afraid of change, and being branded heretics, yet no longer can really believe in the simple answers and rituals of the past, or rely on their superiors for good guidance.<br /><br />The papal delegation, the Dominicans, are rich, fat, and far above the ordinary life of the monks or the 'simple' peasants.  They do not wish to give up the wealth, the life of luxury, the ability to satisfy every personal whim, and the temporal power over kings, states, and the simple peasants that the current state of the church bestows on them.  Within their ranks is an Inquisitor, the judge, and jury they use to keep any who question them in line, with threats of torture, horrible death, and damnation.  They use the Inquisitor to stamp out those who have drunk at the deadly cup of ancient knowledge and who are beginning to question and think for themselves.<br /><br />The Franciscans are the group who represent change, the desire to be free of the trappings of the past, who want to minister to the needs of the people both physical and spiritual and leave power and wealth to Caesar.  They are concerned about the good and bad of the knowledge that can lead one to sin, but they are not all the same and not all want the books hidden or destroyed.  Some believe that using the reason god gave them, they will find more to worship the creator for.  Though their oldest member, Ubertino shows that they come from the same past as the Benedictines.<br /><br />The deaths and murders in the monastery are the outward manifestation of unease, sin, and the breakdown of real belief in the past solutions the church is preaching.  Enter William of Baskerville, and his young novice, who represent the coming of the renaissance, the coming of reason, knowledge and enlightenment.  They move within the rhythms of the monastery, while staying true to their own beliefs.  They try to set the wrongs to right, and move the Benedictines to open their library and disburse the knowledge they hoard, while winning the dispute with the papal legation, and ultimately staying alive.  In some they are successful, and in some they are not - much like life.<br /><br />I can't give the movie 5 stars, because too little time and context was set up so that the viewer who had not read the book would understand what the debate stood for, and what the Greek book stood for.  Without those clues, the movie seems a lot of to-do about some really trivial matters, yet they are still issues we are struggling with today.<br /><br /> This is a movie that you can watch over and over, and pick up and revel in all the details, as well as the wonderful performances.  There are some who think Gui, and Salvatore are over the top, but in fact they are needed as they show real human passion escaping from the control of a repressed setting.  The sex scene is also needed for the story and really rather beautiful.<br /><br />The movie actually led me to read the book, and I think that those who complain about the movie being different don't understand that the movie must be visual, and that what they think is lacking in the story is mostly presented in the visuals.  I agree with the director who said The Name of The Rose is a bestseller which most who purchase don't read, and that if you can read and understand the book, you can also understand and appreciate the movie.  The quibble about the ending is really a matter of your preference for the tone, hopeful, or not.<br /><br />The director's commentary and the documentary on the making of the movie are very good, as is the director's photo tour. The music, sets, lighting, and cinematography are magnificent.

You would THINK that with the popularity that Tom Selleck has reclaimed with the success of his Jesse Stone movies that all of his earlier works would be back in production, but n-o-o-o-o-o.<br /><br />As we know, you can't buy "High Road To China" as a new DVD anymore.  All that exists are various kinds of over-priced used copies, and many of them are in formats that cannot be reliably played on DVD players sold for use in the United States. And there are some offerings of "new" DVD's, but I've got serious doubts about what they originated from.<br /><br />I've tried contacting some of these Sellers to get the answers to simple questions, like, "Is the movie in 4:3 (full-screen) format, or widescreen?", and, "Is this movie formatted in Region 1 or is it 'one size fits all?'". No replies!  I suspect that a some of these offerings are cheap knock-offs that were illegally dubbed for sale... claims of "new, factory-sealed" mean nothing when anybody can get access to heat-shrink machines.<br /><br />Poor Tom Selleck! It's so hard to buy many of the really enjoyable shows he's starred in -- especially the earlier ones.

It's got a plot that's rather silly (though it's essentially the exact same plot as "The Spy Who Loved Me" -- a movie everyone seems to love, even as they bash this one -- it's just set in space instead of at sea), over the top stunts in a couple of scenes (the scene of the gondola turning into a hovercraft and floating through the Piazza San Marco in Venice makes me wince), and gadgets that belong more in a Star Trek movie than in a Bond film.<br /><br />Yet despite all these undoubted flaws, I still love this movie.  It's hard to say why, but I imagine it's because it was the first Bond film I ever saw in the theater.  I was just a kid, fresh off Star Wars, and being a sci-fi fan, I loved it.  I suppose that fond, childhood recollection colors my view.  But having said that, this movies does have some very good points.  The heroine, Lois Chiles, is the best looking Bond girl since Claudine Auger in Thunderball, in my opinion.  The locations, particularly Venice, and the Amazon jungle, are simply breathtakingly beautiful.  The special effects, though they do occur in scenes that just don't belong in a Bond movie, are really quite good.  The villian, Hugo Drax, is the most sinister Bond villian since Blofeld, and is well acted by Michael Lonsdale.  It's got Richard Kiel as Jaws (and really, how can you not like Jaws?)  And finally, John Barry's musical score is, I think, the best he ever did for the Bond series.<br /><br />So despite all the undeniable flaws, and despite the fact that I greatly prefer the earlier, more realistic Bond films from Sean Connery's run, I still can't help but like this Bond film.  It has a unique charm.

 | product/productId: 6301734734 | review/userId: A3BIFXBEOT5AEV | review/summary: A great film | review/text: Beginning in Atlanta Georgia in 1948, Southern Jewish-matron Daisy Werthan looses control of her brand new '48 Packard while backing out of the garage. After panicking Miss Daisy slams on the gas (instead of the break) and backs her car into a ditch causing some concern for both her safety and her eligibility for motor vehicle insurance. In reference to these concerns, Boolie a local businessman and Miss Daisy's son, hires his mother a driver and purchases her a new 48 Hudson for his mother to ride in. When confronted with antagonism, Miss Daisies new driver Hoke meets confrontation with charming submission and an equally stubborn disposition as the decades pass by on there friendship.<br /><br />Glasses<br /><br /> The opening dialoged in this movie is a conversation between Boolie and his mother Daisy would has just crashed her car. Boolie suggests that Miss Daisy needs glasses. He is somewhat comedic but overall forceful and logical. He is much less concerned with his mother's problem and much more concerned with fixing things. When he tells his mother she might need glasses Miss Daisy responds with, "the cumbers are nice this time of year". When Boolie tells his mother that she is lucky to be alive (and we'll come back to this later) Daisy tells her son "it was the cars fault".<br /><br />Religion and Race<br /><br /> Religion too is a major point of discussion within this movie. At one point Daisy is upset with her son because he is "socializing with Episcopalians". The way the Boolie handles these comments is with sarcasm or to ignore her comments all together. As the movie progresses on however, Miss Daisy seems to gain some respect for Christianity claiming that Hoke is probably the only real Christian at a party. She also allows the death of her housekeeper and cook Idella to impact her view as she (who is normally very concerned about how she is be see) attends a primarily if not all black church for Idella's funeral. Later Daisy openly attends a dinner where Dr. Martin Luther Kings Jr. is speaking.<br /><br /> At one point in the film the audience comes to learn that Miss Daisy's Temple has been bombed. At first she is complacent, but soon she becomes augmentative as she denies even the possibility that Hoke and his informative police officer are telling the truth. While Hokes age and experience has helped him to reflect and remember back on a similar incident of racism in his own past and where he seeks to share and remember Miss Daisy approaches this incident very similarly to the way she handles most problems in her aging life: she ignores the problem or she attempts to argue it away.<br /><br />Independence<br /><br /> One of the most pivotal moments in the film comes when Hoke first begins to drive Miss Daisy. As Hoke says, "it took six days, the same time it took the Lord to make the world". As Daisy stubbornly walks to the local grocery store known as the Pigly Wiggly, Hoke begins to drive along beside her (we'll come back to this as well). Eventually overcome with embarrassment Miss Daisy gives in and gets into the car amidst the prying eyes of her neighbors.<br /><br /> Soon the issue becomes more obvious. Daisy states a number of times that she doesn't need a driver, and that her late husband had taught her how to drive and take care of a car. Clearly daisy feels that she is loosing control over her own life. She no longer cooks for herself, and she no longer drives herself and so she feels she must attempt to control everything she can. She tries to control her son and his marriage she tries to control how people view her in her community and interestingly though she cannot control the steering wheel she does control who has the keys and where the car is parked.<br /><br />Space in the house<br /><br /> Another interesting piece of information the viewer is given comes from a conversation between Boolie and Daisy just after Hoke is hired. In there talk on the phone Daisy admits to her son that she doesn't want anyone in her house eating her food and taking up space. She deals with a common problem among retired people and wants her things to remain just as she has always had them. Although the care taker Idella has grown on her over the many years she remarks that Hoke makes her feel like she has "no privacy". Her response is to openly criticize everything Hoke does and to attempt to get rid of him. Hoke on the other hand is aging as well. However he deals with these issues in a very different way. For the most part Hoke approaches things with simple reason. He is not concerned about the neighbors; he parks the car in the best possible space. He is not going to be told when he can "make water" or have control over the keys, and even purchases the old Hudson commanding it for himself on his own terms. Although he too is feeling uncomfortable of being in Miss Daisy's space he feels the need to be useful.<br /><br />Usefulness<br /><br /> Usefulness is certainly a large part of this story about ageing. Both characters in fact deal with this issue in different ways. For Hoke, he cannot handle making money without doing any work. Rather than getting paid and being lazy he sees opportunities to work all around the house (though Daisy won't allow it). Coming back to what I said earlier Hoke ultimately finds his usefulness in driving Miss Daisy as best he can. The pinnacle of this is the encounter where he drives beside her while she walks down to the Piggy Wiggly until she agrees to ride in the car.<br /><br /> For Daisy the issue is fairly similar. Daisy is often found talking about the good ol' days, when she was growing up; when there was little to eat and when things were hard. But she doesn't look back on those times as being a stain on her life as Hoke believes he might. Instead she looks back fondly on those times because she felt useful. This can most clearly be seen in the grave yard scene where Hoke reveals that he is functionally illiterate. Daisy reaches what is clearly her kindest moment in the film and things turn towards friendship when she tries to teach him how to read and when she smilingly hands him a reading workbook from her old days as a teacher.<br /><br />The Death of a Friend<br /><br />Certainly one of the most impacting movements of this film comes when Miss Idella passes away. Earlier in the film, just after crashing the car into the ditch Daisy's son Boolie had told his mother that she was lucky to be alive. Daisy's response was to ignore him and to blame the whole things on the car saying, "it was the cars fault".  Here though we are confronted with an entirely new kind of Daisy. While she had been rejecting the idea that things were changing, while she had rejected to notion that she was getting older, needed glasses, or could possible die, now Daisy looks at things in a whole new light. The death of Idella forces her to look at her own life and in response to her death Daisy sadly tells Hoke that Idella was the Lucky one.<br /><br />Aging<br /><br /> By the end of the movie each character has aged considerably. Boolie faces ageing with a smile and a joke telling his business friends that he has "less up here (hair) more down here (fat)" and that this has made him work harder. Hoke tells Daisy that the old Hudson is "in the Junk Yard now some 15 years" and leads the viewer into the next faze of Daisy's life where she has become confused at times and can no longer live at home. At this point we see Hoke in a very similar situation to the Daisy we were introduced to. Hokes eyes are bad and he is now driven around by granddaughter no longer able to do his life's work. Rather than the gradual acceptance of aging like Miss Daisy did, Hoke represents a kind of acceptance. He faces old age with a smile and with his old friend Miss Daisy by his side.
 | product/productId: 6302484359 | review/userId: AP8HVZLVTAJCH | review/summary: 'It's what you do with what you've got!' | review/text: So Dear To My Heart is an absolute gem of a movie! A delightful musical drama about a young boy with big dreams, and an unwanted black lamb named Danny. It is a gentle, heartwarming story, simply told & beautifully understated. A movie full of nostalgic charm and appeal. Set at the turn of the century in 1903, it recreates small town America with stunning detail.<br /><br />The film begins as the pages of a scrapbook open, and as they turn, they are brought to life through the art of animation, before dissolving into the live action world. The transitions between the animated pages of the scrapbook and the live action scenes are so beautifully and seamlessly done, that it allows the film to flow freely at all times as one unique piece of work. The animation never appears to be out-of-place or obtrusive.<br /><br />Much is understated in this movie, and it remains the better for it. We can tell that life has not been the easiest for the Kincaids and it is interesting to note that even here we have the theme of a single parent, in this case a grandparent, left to raise a child, whilst single-handedly working the farm.<br /><br />The film never comes across as saccharine. Thanks to a wonderful script with good, solid characters that have such great depth to them. And they are played to perfection by a good, strong cast. Every role has been cast perfectly. From Beulah Bondi as Granny, the legendary Harry Carey as the judge, Bobby Driscol & Luanna Patten as the two children, to Burl Ives in his very first feature film appearance, as that loveable Uncle Hiram. The ending is just right too. Winning the first prize blue ribbon would've been just too schmaltzy. What we are left with instead is an ending that is much more rewarding and satisfactory.<br /><br />For me, the film works on every level. And it is augmented by a wonderful score by Paul Smith and choral arrangements by Ken Darby. But it is the heart of the movie that has endeared it to me. One of faith, hope, and love. And of great wisdom. Of daring to dream big, but not to despise the day of small beginnings. It's encouraging messages of "It's what you do with what you've got" and 'Stick-to-it-ivity.' But most of all, about learing to keep and maintain right priorities in life, something that Jeremiah learns during the course of the film. To quote the film's opening line, "The greatest wealth a man may acquire is the wisdom he gains from living. And sometimes, out of the small beginnings, come the forces that shape a whole life."
 | product/productId: 6301783018 | review/userId: AG6NBC3NLVVJ | review/summary: Torture for art's sake??? | review/text: This over the top art flick makes some snobby reference to the emerging middle class into money and power.  Apparently in England that is a bad thing.  This country has a branch of government (the house of lords) that only requires you are born of certain families and you get to write laws that affect everyone ELSE. Anyway the director and writer is an ARTIST so he is above it all apparently and he has a self made man portrayed as a brute, criminal and torturer. That's what happens when you are not born from the proper noble stock. The worlds biggest fashion victim designer  Jean Paul Gaultier is responsible for the costumes and the talented actors involved in this joke hopefully fired their agents by now. Call me too  sensitive but I don't enjoy watching a 10 year old boy get slowly stabbed in the stomach nor am I a big fan of torture for arts sake.

DVD transfer A++ | review/text: So many others have done justice to this outstanding movie, I will focus on technical quality of this DVD. I do love this movie, I've seen it perhaps 15 times in as many years. And of course Casablanca is one of the most quotable movies ever!<p>The DVD transfer of this B&amp;W classic is OUTSTANDING!! I watch this on my 2200 lumens front projection system. I have an enormous screen measuring 14.5' diagonal! I can easily see the quality of the digital transfer on every DVD, and I am astonished at the high quality of this transfer for Casablanca.<p>The film noire aspect is perfectly captured in high resolution sharp detail (but not excessively so). You can see absolutely everything ... the patterns on ties, Ingrid's jewelry and beautiful hair, incredible detail on wardrobe and props, etc. If you are used to seeing Casablanca on VHS, then viewing this DVD on a nice home theater system will be like seeing the movie for the first time ... it is so rich in detail.<p>The quality of the contrast calibration is great! Deep black, crisp white and an excellent transfer curve in between. All the cast look great. They really did an excellent job in transferring this classic film. I know I sound impressed, but I am not exaggerating in the least about the quality ... my home theater screen is huge and this film looks great, as good as anything you would ever see in a cinema. I am not easy to please, and this disc is so well done that this great film is a joy to watch, again and again and again.<p>The dolby digital 2.0 mono audio transfer is excellent as well. It's hard to believe that this disc is of a film made 61 years ago.<p>Very well done DVD. Enjoy!

 | product/productId: 0767851900 | review/userId: A1JG9920BAIQTD | review/summary: Brilliant | review/text: Some find it odd that some one of my most oft-repeated sayings when discussing religion in serious conversations comes from a Kevin Smith movie -- "I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier." But I think that that line alone made this movie more than just a screwball comedy, controversial for the sake of being controversial. "Dogma" has some actual messages to get across, and it just happens to do it in a much more enjoyable way than, say, "The Passion."<p>The movie follows a disillusioned Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino) on her journey, ordered by Metadron (Alan Rickman), to stop two fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from reentering heaven, thus rendering God's word reversible and ending the world as we know it. Along the way, she encounters workers of God, prophets, and the missing thirteenth apostle (Chris Rock, my favorite part of the movie). I'm not going to reveal any more of the plot, except to say that Alanis Morissette makes a pretty unexpected (and funny, when you consider the absurdity of it) appearance.<p>The great thing about "Dogma" is that it always seems to know exactly what it's doing. There's parts when it's supposed to be screwball humor (which is most of it), and parts when it's supposed to be more serious. It blends these two perfectly together, and the result makes you laugh and think at the same time. Truthfully, not many movies can do that. Sure, some may watch it only for the appearance of Kevin Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself, respectively) but if you look deeper, there's some real substance to this movie. It's not a bashing of the Catholic church; it's simply a movie that reminds you to ask questions. Highly recommended unless you're an easily offended Catholic.
 | product/productId: 6300183823 | review/userId: AGZVS6M8XJGN6 | review/summary: One one of the warmest, most deeply felt characterizations in all Western movies... | review/text: No Western could be more out of time-scale than "Lonely are the Brave," and yet, paradoxically, no central character was ever more truly Western than Jack Burns, the strange wanderer, played by Kirk Douglas...<br /><br />Douglas in this film version of Edward Abbey's moving novel 'Brave Cowboy' is, among a number of other things, a man who hates barbed wire... He showed, a similar dislike for it in King Vidor's "Man Without a Star" (1955), which was a traditional cattle range movie, and in those circumstances that seemed reasonable enough... But "Lonely are the Brave" is a film set in the New Mexico of 1953 and such behavior now seems totally irrational...<br /><br />But then he's an irrational, quite extraordinary man... He rides a horse called Whisky when the world flashes past him in Cadillacs... He carries a guitar and sings folksy ballads of the old West... Arriving in the concrete of Duke City he is quite confident that in order to free a pal he has only got to break into jail, fool a sheriff and make his getaway... After all, it's Western territory and this was always the way of it...<br /><br />Who and what is he? The question bears examination for he is one of the most intriguing characters in the whole Western portrait gallery... He is never really explained in the book, nor indeed in the film... He is drawn and stated and the rest is left to the reader or audience... You watch the way he moves, you listen to what he says and the way he says it... You observe his strange actions and reactions... But most1y you are left to make your own conclusions...<br /><br />Is it a case of a fantasist totally hooked on the Western legend? Has he seen too many Western movies (probably 'B' features)? Has he read too much Western pulp fiction? Is he so deep in thought by it all that he is incapable of realizing that the world has moved on, is running out of grass, or tolerance for oddballs with a preference for grass?<br /><br />Is he making a protest about what the West has become, and is seeking, in his inarticulate way, after different values? Is he just pure throwback, a man belonging to another time? This figures, as he might say... He would belong so splendidly, with his simple values...<br /><br />Whatever he is, he's a profoundly tragic conception....<br /><br />The old friend he is there to aid (Michael Kane) has been jailed for giving shelter to over-the-border illegal immigrants... Douglas calls on his buddy's wife, sensitively played by Gena Rowlands, who seems as touched and dazed by him as anyone in the audience... In order to get Kane out of prison he decides that he first needs to get into it himself and so after a saloon bar fight, followed by more fisticuffs at the jail, he gets the cell he wants...<br /><br />In jail, however, he finds himself once more knocking up against the twentieth century--its mores and inhibitions... The pal doesn't want to conform to the old Western pattern by making a break for it... Far better to serve out his two years and then return to his wife and child knowing that his 'debt to society' has been paid and they will have nothing else to worry about... This is not just pure self-interest... He honestly thinks it the right thing to do...<br /><br />So having fought his way in, Douglas now has to fight his way out... This he does with the aid of files he brought with him to effect his friend's escape... And out with him go a couple of characters not inhibited by fears and scruples...<br /><br />So he becomes a man on the run, but, since he still has his horse, an old-style outlaw on the run, heading for the mountains with--naturally--a posse after him...<br /><br />But no ordinary posse... This is the 20th century version, supplied with all sorts of technological devices... If this very recent cowboy in his strange, ancient times way, is challenging the rule of technology, it is only logical that the long cold arm of science should reach out for him... It does so with walkie-talkie radios, jeeps and even a specially borrowed helicopter...<br /><br />What chance has he? The sheriff seems puzzled by the situation--that a man on a horse should dare everything against such a formidable array of gadgetry... Since the enigmatic wanderer is determinedly playing out a Western drama he must inevitably come up against a compassionate sheriff...<br /><br />The sheriff is a man doing a job, without any keen enjoyment for the job or, in fact, for anything particularly... He's bored, skeptical, laconic, and you feel that he would like nothing better than for Burns to get out of his territory...<br /><br />But while the sheriff goes about his manhunting duties in a routine way he lets slip another implication--that deep, down in the lethargy and disillusion there's a soft spot for the man on a horse... Is the sheriff at heart--if you could ever find his heart--a bit of a rebel, too?<br /><br />Kirk Douglas will be remembered most of all for his performance as the man out of step, out of his proper time... His Jack Burns in "Lonely are the Brave" is one of the warmest, most deeply felt characterizations in all Western movies... David Miller directed the film with simplicity and a similar warmth... No more was needed...

Joel Schumacher took that dark vision and gave it a metrosexual makeover.<br /><br /> Val Kilmer takes over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne and, even though he is better than Michael Keaton, doesn't seem like he really cares to be in the film, Chris O'Donnell joins the cast as Robin and returns us to the creepy, homoerotic feel of the sixties TV series, Tommy Lee Jones gives an uneven performance as Two-Face, Nicole Kidman is bloody awful in a pointless part, and the one saving grace for this terrible film: Jim Carrey as The Riddler!<br /><br />  Even though The Riddler origins have been rewritten, which is a huge mistake; Carrey's manic performance is a joy to watch and, at times, seems to be taken directly Frank Gorshin's great Riddler from the sixties.<br /><br />  A big day-glow thumbs down to Joel Schumacher ludicrous version of Batman, and a thank you to Jim Carrey for keeping the viewer from gouging his eyes out in disgust.

 | product/productId: 6302484367 | review/userId: A27KNXAROMSJ7A | review/summary: Still the Chilliest....Billy | review/text: I treated myself to a viewing of this DVD the weekend before this Halloween, and it reminded me what a transitional film George Romero had made back in 1968.  By then, we had already seen a decade of gore, what with sexploitation films like 1963's "Blood Feast", and with Sam Peckinpah's nausea-inducing (literally, for many patrons) "The Wild Bunch". But Romero couched his gore in shadows,  in eerie, silent, (read: no score) black and white, and then rooted his feet firmly in the future and the past. He paid homage to his film ancesters by reminding us of Frankenstein's monster stumbling towards the innocents (albeit in droves), seeking their blood (Dracula), and then to Orson Welle's infamous War of the World's broadcast, a play that would have been chilling enough had not tens of thousands of listeners not heard it and thought the radio reports of Martians attacking were real.  In NOLD, Romero has his live protagonists watch, horrified, as television anchors tell them (Orson Welles style) of the incredible but "it must be true" monsters that are attacking, of instructions scientists are giving which are horrifying ("When someone dies, there is no time for funerals or such niceties.  You must burn the body immediately, within minutes....")<br /><br />All the while, a race drama which may have been one of the first of its kind (although "In the Heat of the Night" preceded the film)unfolds in the house where the protagonists have sheltered themselves, and which is constantly reached into by a zombie arm or leg. An argument ensues over whether the group should remain upstairs, where escape might be possible if the zombies break through the barriers; or in the cellar (symbolic bomb shelter?) to create even more of a barrier.  Predictably, with tensions arising, even when the black and white men looked upon as the leaders seem to have come to agreement, bonds within the group prove too weak to maintain.<br /><br />As for Romero's foot in the future of film, this movie set off his own franchise of zombie films.  But it's clear many newer films have tipped their hat to this one.  The Joker of Tim Burton's "Batman" dancing with an unconcious Vicki Vale, foreshadowing the plague that is to hit Gotham (one that definitely harkens back to this plague on the eastern seaboard in 1968.)  And how NOLD spans the Cold War arm and arm with the two most memorable (to date) versions of War of the Worlds is uncanny.  Radioactive fallout from a troubled  sattelite (in the outer space of H. G. Wells himself) causes a monstrosity that completely overwhelms humanity, that at first we have no defenses against, until we pool our collective brainpower....even then, we lose many good people who could have helped along the way.<br /><br />I am especially struck by how much the cellar scenes, and the hysterics of Mr. Cooper, the "Pro-Cellar" leader,  remind me of the basement "This is not an attack, it's an extermination" scene in Spielberg's War of the Worlds this summer.  A better tribute to this film's importance in the whole of the genre could not be serendipidous.<br /><br />Fear not...or rather, fear, if you seek a film for pure entertainment value, and not its role in the history of literature.  If you haven't seen it before, and sleep soundly the night after you've seen it, ask for your money back.
 | product/productId: 0800185188 | review/userId: A1M9DQDGE07Q0U | review/summary: WIN WITH WILLIE - POLITICS AND CORRUPTION; What A Novel Mix! | review/text: &quot;All The King's Men&quot; is the political melodrama that swept the Oscars and made actor, Broderick Crawford a household name.  Pity that in the intervening decades he's all but been forgotten. Crawford is Willie Stark - an honest man butting heads in the political arena until he finally gets his chance to rule when he sweeps the every man's election.  Too bad for Willie that the power goes to his head.  John Ireland costars as the reporter who wants so desperately to believe in Willie that he's willing to overlook the slow spiral out of control.  Mercedes McCambridge is a publicist with only greed in her heart and poison on her mind. John Derek is cast as Willie's son - the tragic victim of his father's scaling to great heights.<br />TRANSFER: Somewhat of a disappointment. Though the gray scale is reasonably well balanced though at times the contrast levels seem to be a shade too low. A lot of wear and tear has gone into this film's original camera negative.  Scratches and age related blemishes are glaringly obvious.  Some sections of the print appear to have been lifted from third generation masters instead of the film's original camera negative.  There are moments when aliasing and pixelization crop up but these don't terribly distract.  The audio is MONO but nicely balanced.<br />EXTRAS: NOT A CHANCE!<br />BOTTOM LINE: The drama is compelling.  If you can get through all the surface issues with regards to the print elements, then you are in for a very stirring film.
 | product/productId: 0767817672 | review/userId: A2YQI7AJYC49AT | review/summary: The forgotten players | review/text: From a cinematic point of view, this movie was a fine work of art.  I was taken by the landscape and by the performances of Wes Studi as Geronimo and Gene Hackman as "Nantan Lupan."  But what this fan appreciated most about this movie was the appearance on an unsung military officer by the name of Charles Gatewood - it was past time for the part he played in the "Apache Wars" to be acknowledged.  Gatewood was apparently an individual of some integrity and appeared to be able to carry out his orders with dignity and compassion.  For readers interested in discovering more about this officer, I would suggest that they read the excellent material on him written by the historian Louis Kraft.  Gatewood was rewarded for his exemplary service to our nation by becoming the victim of the pettiness and selfish self-centeredness of Nelson Miles, the officer commanding the Apache campaign at the time of Gatewood's service.  I wish there was a way to commend Gatewood, and censure Miles.  While this movie fictionalizes some key points in the chain of events and does little to honor the Apache people, it succeeds in bringing to light the labors of good human being attempting to be of service to his fellow man - regardless of skin color, rank or station.

I thought the original<br />EXORCIST was unforgettable at the movies and this<br />has many scarey moments, its not quite as powerful<br />as the the first one but it goes in its own direction<br />and has several scenes of pure terror. I enjoyed the<br />sounds quality on this movie and George Scott is<br />great in this, as he was also in the spookie, THE<br />CHANGELING.  This is very well made and acted movie.<br />There<br />are a number of little touches that take this movie<br />out of the ordinary, as stated in other reviews, the<br />confessional scene especially, the patients at the<br />hospital, so many strange sounds keep your blood pumped and<br />keep the story moving.

Re-watching it with Oliver Stone's added footage, made it riveting! Oliver Stone said that he thought this film and his film, "Nixon", are his Godfather Part One and Two. I am in complete agreement with him. This is a spellbinding thriller even if you didn't live through this era.

It was indeed pretty entertaining with all the battles and so forth.  But the final part, where poor old Wallace is drawn and quartered was really too much for me--especially given the fact that what I had been subjected to in the hospital was major abdominal surgery!  To see all of those crude implements assembled and then applied to Gibson's character made me wince--especially with a few dozen surgical staples still holding my incision closed!  I really doubt that Wallace would have been able to articulate even the word "freedom" after having his guts mangled in such a way!

 | product/productId: 6302034981 | review/userId: A356TJCTCLDN89 | review/summary: go watch Virgin Spring instead | review/text: Last House on the Left is one of those infamous movies that people talk about but no-one ever actually saw. It's never on TV and I had begun to think it was more myth than real until I finally saw it. Right away I realized that it' loosely based on Ingemar Bergman's Virgin Spring which is about a tighly controlled man who realizes that the two travelers sleeping in his barn are actually responsible for the murder and rape of his favorite child. What should he do? What would you do? Later as a twist you wonder what will God do?<br /><br />That movie was a chilly Swedish classic. Last House is just grue, it's grand guinol, it's essentially as close to a snuff film as most folks would ever want to get. And it's poorly acted to boot. Wes Craven, who obviously went on to better things must have gotten these actors off the street and paid them with lunch.<br /><br />Two young girls are kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed. The rape and torture goes on for a very long time. There is a disembowling scene and it's long and the camera lingers in a close shot of the intestines. Fun stuff, eh? Not to me. Later the parents of one of the girls finds out and go after the crazed drifters who did the deed.<br /><br />If your taste in horror runs towards ghosts, vamps, werewolves and the nameless thing in the dark Last House is not for you. Either pass it by or watch Virgin Spring instead.

 | product/productId: 6301661761 | review/userId: A96K1ZGW56S2I | review/summary: Rewriting History. | review/text: BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the fifth movie in the PLANET OF THE APES series. It's a decent movie, but could have been much better with a bigger budget.<p>The movie takes place several years after the ape revolt and after mankind has almost destroyed itself by nuking cities around the world. Caesar has established an ape city several miles outside of what was once New York City. In Ape City, apes and men coexist but not as equals. Men are subservient to apes and Caesar says it will stay that way until he can trust the "race of man", not just a few individual humans. The climax of the film occurs when mutants attack Ape City in an attempt to restablish human supremacy.<p>The movie itself is an average 1970s film. The movie illustrates how the apes were just as destructive as humans. However, this latest edition of BATTLE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES tries to rewrite the Apes mythos by leaving out a crucial scene. This version of the film leaves out the scene where the remaining mutants begin worshiping the Doomsday Bomb that destroys the world at the end of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. This version of the movie ends with a scene of The Lawgiver teaching to a group of ape and human children leaving the viewer believing that history had been changed, when in actuallity it had not.<p>Overall, an average movie, but the weakest of the APES movies.
 | product/productId: 0790715112 | review/userId: A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2 | review/summary: Western drama | review/text: This is a western for the ages set in late nineteen century Montana.<br /><br />A saloon girl is beaten and knife-cut. Her coworkers are angry but the sheriff (Gene Hackman) does not want to do much about it. Her coworkers put up a thousand dollar reward to obtain justice, but the reward only draws undesirables and brings trouble to Big Whiskey, Montana.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris join forces in an effort to obtain the reward money. After the setting, the story is mainly about the confrontation within the trio and the sheriff and the values that emerge considering that the gun is mainly law.<br /><br />Disc two is about 'the making of' and a considerable data base of Clint Eastwood movies. Included is an episode from "Maverick" starring James Garner and a very young Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />"Unforgiven" belongs next to "High Noon". It is that good.

It's stilted in parts and very stagey.  The best scene is the mock trial with Irene Papas (fabulous as Helen of Troy) and Katherine Hepburn (in a good turn as Hecuba) arguing what should be Helen's fate.  If you're a fan of Bujold, Redgrave, or Papas you may want to watch this for their performances, as none of these actresses has a scene together the scene selection makes it easy to just see the actress that interests you (Hepburn is in the whole movie).  Otherwise, you may feel like you are watching a homework assignment.
 | product/productId: 5554454763 | review/userId: ARAYL97JHBAAS | review/summary: Carousel gives you a catharis | review/text: This movie is full of joy and love and pain.  It is the story of the life of a man who is a Carousel barker - a good one, too, but who doesn't know who to earn money any other way.  He meets a sweet and independent, beautiful young woman, who works at a mill.  They soon find themselves out of work, married and with a baby coming.<br /><br />And it's about second chances.  The Carousel barker gets a second chance to set things right after he dies trying to find a way to get money to support his family.<br /><br />The movie is the origin of one of my favorite songs of all times - You'll Never Walk alone.  "When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark. At the end of the storm is a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark...."

 | product/productId: 0767850246 | review/userId: A2582KMXLK2P06 | review/summary: I laughed, but it's not brilliant or anything | review/text: I really liked the way the jokes came across in What Planet Are You From?<br /><br />Lots of weiner jokes that were used creatively and even somewhat intelligently, NOT horribly and obvious.  The way the "alien" would come up to women and demand having sex with them because it was his job to have a baby with a woman and bring the baby back to his home alien world was VERY funny to me.  Of course it wasn't believable in ANY way, and it wasn't supposed to be.<br /><br />I'm very surprised the writers actually included segments involving the alien world, since to me, that seems one step TOO far into whacky and tacky, if you get my drift.<br /><br />I thought the story was great how the "alien" finally found just the right woman for him to have a baby with, and honestly, the very best thing about the movie is the way the alien cleverly tried convincing women he wanted to have a baby with them.  You see, the women thought the alien was a nice, responsible adult man looking to start a family- they had no IDEA he was actually an alien appearing on earth for one reason and one reason only, and *this* is why the story was great!<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was how the alien (in case you don't know, the alien is actually just an adult man) came back to earth- apparently the only way he can get back to earth is to appear in an airplane that's flying in the air.  VERY silly.<br /><br />Overall though, a unique comedy that's full of hidden laughs and great moments.
 | product/productId: 0792846508 | review/userId: A3HN134PKEXFOZ | review/summary: It's A Dog Eat Dog World... | review/text: Texas Chainsaw 2 is an over-the-top, phantasmagoric thrill ride of a horror-comedy. It is the first sequel to the highly influential 1974 original Tobe Hooper masterpiece the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the only one to stray very far from the formula of the original. Most of the familiar characters are back the three Sawyer brothers Drayton (the cook), Bubba (Leatherface), Grandpa, and Chop-Top who sat out the first movie in Vietnam. Chop-Top has erroneously been identified with the his other brother the Hitcher from the first film who met his demise at the end by being run over by a semi. The Hitcher makes his appearance in part 2 as the dessicated corpse dubbed Nubbins that Chop-Top dances around with. Sure this film has a pretty incoherent plot, but who cares? It does not try to be the original, and that was smart on Hooper's part. With this film he makes a mostly surreal/fantasy piece that has some horrific effects by horror-maestro Tom Savini. The sets towards the end when they reveal the Sawyer's hideout are fantastic, an abandoned theme park with underground passages, and there are some fine performances throughout especially by Jim Siedow (RIP) who plays the cook and has the choicest lines in the film. I can understand why most people find Chop-Top's incessant blabbering annoying, but to me he is a plus in the film as true psychotic whereas Leatherface is played as an almost sympathetic character falling somewhat in love with Lefty. Dennis Hopper seems to be having fun spouting biblical nonsense, and wielding his chainsaws with equal fervor to the maniancs he's been hunting. Look for a cameo appearance in the hotel scene in the beginning by director Hooper, and southern horror maven Joe Bob Briggs. Overall this film is escapist fantasy, and not meant to be taken that seriously.

It is hard to believe that a mere 11 minutes can change a movie so much, but this is a bastardised version of the picture. Not only has the content been altered, but the colour and soundtrack are not up to scratch on this video release. <p>Do yourself a favour, view one of the 20th century's great pieces of cinema on the directors cut DVD. It will be worth the extra.
 | product/productId: 5554818323 | review/userId: A1QI4ATF368A9B | review/summary: ok romantic comedy | review/text: Ben Stiller and Ed Norton star as a rabbi and priest who are reunited with their friend from junior high school, a high-powered, workaholic businesswoman played by Jenna Elfman. I thought Norton and Stiller had good chemistry and were believable as life-long friends. I thought the early scenes in which a Jew and Christian become interested in each other's faith interesting. I just wished this would have been developed more throughout the film.<br /><br />When Elfman's character comes into the picture, she throws her two male friends' lives for a loop. Stiller is a rabbi who is being pressured to meet and marry a nice Jewish girl, and Norton is a priest who must live a life of celibacy. Both men lust for Elfman. Stiller, who begins secretly dating Elfman, is afraid his synagogue and his congregation and family will find out that he is involved with a non-Jew. Norton contemplates violating his celibacy vows so he can be with Elfman.<br /><br />My problem is that these two men swoon so much over Elfman. She is attractive but not a stunning head-turner. She's not a great actress, either, and belongs on TV. I thought another actress, maybe Cameron Diaz, might have been better in the role.<br /><br />Also, it's obvious that Elfman and Stiller are in LUST, not love, as they seem to spend a lot of their time in bed with each other. Their relationship is shallow. Stiller's character, who has a history of having flings with women, seemed a bit shallow himself. Norton's character seemed a bit deeper. Another problem is that Stiller and Elfman have no real chemistry together. Elfman seemed to have more chemistry with Norton, actually.<br /><br />I also think the love triangle could have used more tension, too. Elfman flirts with Norton, but once she gets involved with Stiller, she seems to treat him more like a brother. It would have complicated things more if maybe Elfman had some genuine feelings for Norton as well and then he could have very real inner turmoil about his chastity vows.<br /><br />Of course, everything ends up very nice and neat and predictably, but I thought Elfman chose the wrong guy and I doubt their shallow relationship will last after the movie is over. Overall, this is an enjoyable piece of fluff if you are in the mood for a romantic comedy.

A very stylized, complete kind of artwork, it takes enough detours from the melodrama to remain interesting indeed.

Also, I don't think the franchise that is spawned every lived up to the initial movie, which is very clearly meant to stand alone (it forecasts a better human future, that ain't happened). CCS

I really think you have to read a few comic books to really appreciate ths film. The laughs  kept coming as they knocked Superman's identity, the Batman films and a  number of other superhero cliches. I found most of the characters good  except Ben Stiller's Mr. Furious Character got old pretty fast. The special  effects and set were well done, the city and opening theme obviously a poke  at the overblown Batman films. The big fight at the end is great with a  large variety of villains. This film is not for everyone, I think it  probably would have done better if it had been made between 1992 and 1994  when comic books were at a peak. I do think this film will have a cult  following on video. It kind of reminds me of the Clue film from 1986  because it is kind of a different premise that gives some really good  supporting comedians a chance to shine. Very amusing, but not for everyone.

There are two groups of toys. One is a set of aliens under the premise that they have crashed on Earth and need assistance. The other is a group of soldiers who have been taught the Gorgonites (the aliens) are their enemies.<br /><br />With top secret military computer chips installed, the toys turn out to be much smarter than anyone planned, and the soldiers group, in their relentless hunt for the Gorgonites, poses some real problems for real people. A teenage boy and the girl next door are put in the position of defending the alien toys, and themselves.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is in fine form voicing of leader of the soldiers, and Frank Langella gives the Gorgonite leader real feeling and dignity. Other performances are spot on and often funny. A lot of humorous catch phrases are tossed around in clever contexts throughout the film.<br /><br />The DVD presentation is crisp and well framed, and the sound is excellent.<br /><br />This is a very different type of story, although in general it reminds me somewhat of Gremlins. An enjoyable watch.

This is not one of them. It probably should be. You will find that many of the Python crew plays many different characters in the movie.<br />Now the truth can be told. It all starts with three wise men delivering gifts to young Brian. Oops they correct their mistake. Later, Judea, 33 A.D., on a Saturday afternoon, once again Brian (Graham Chapman) is a tad far down the mount when they hear what sounds as "blessed are the cheese makers" (it's not meant to be taken literally that could mean any manufacturer). That is where Brian first sees Judith (Sue Jones.) Later he shall be involved in the People's Front of Judea. Later still he will be mistaken for the messiah (it is a logical mistake). Two factions fight over who owns the messiah (the Shoe Followers and Gourd Followers.)<br />You will recognize many of your favorite vices and verses. One of the highlights of the story is the speech given by Pilate and Biggus Dickus.<br />As with most complex movies you will find the one you are looking for Python comedy, fanatic parody, or if you wish a deeper meaning.<br />If you enjoyed this movie the next on your list should be "Wholly Moses" (1983) with Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman.

The violent men features a top notch cast. Glenn ford, Edwarg G robinson and the queen of film noir Barbara Stanwyck  starr in this Rudolph Mate (DOA) directed take on your standatre western. It's basically about a  shrewd, crippled  land tycoon (Robinson) his wife, (Stanwyck) and his hired goons who are taking  all of the neighboring farmers land. He has almost all of the land he needs except for Glenn Ford's land. Conflicts and mayhem aboud.  <p>Sounds like about 100 other westerns everyone's seen a million times. Well, not this one. This is coming from a director(Mate) who directed a film noir classic so you know that  the story wouldn't be that simple. There are quite a few twists and turns and more than a few wrinkles thrown in for good measure. The violent men is well directed with very good performances throught with particular nods to Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G Robinson who work here for the first time since Billy Wilders classic Double Indemnity. Good Stuff.
 | product/productId: 6302171725 | review/userId: A2JOUZJYNM2XTO | review/summary: Timeless Movie; Brilliant Acting | review/text: I think "Silence of the Lambs" may very well be the best movie I've ever seen.  It is marked the best in my mind for universally excellent acting (particularly Foster, Hopkins, and Ted Levine), a racing, suspenseful plot, thrilling elements of character you will have never seen coming, and an on-the-edge-of your seat feeling from the moment you first meet Dr. Hannibal Lecter to the moment the credits begin to roll.  I love being drawn into movies in such a way that real life seems far far away.  This is one of those movies.<br /><br />Clarice Starling is a young, strong-willed FBI student assigned to interview the intriguing and frightening Hannibal Lecter.  Starling finds herself involved in hunting down Buffalo Bill (a killer nicknamed as such for the way he "skins his humps") with Lecter's help.  The mind games and conversations that go on between Starling and Lecter are absolutely my favorite parts of this movie.  So many times I thought I'd had a grip on the plot only to find myself totally thrown again and again.<br /><br />"Silence of the Lambs" is not only a truly wonderful movie in general, but in the subcategory of horror/suspense/thriller movies, it is perfect.  Suspense, a slight bit of gore to keep your heart pounding, remarkable and admirable characters, and just the right amount of disturbing chills placed tastefully throughout the whole thing combine to become my recipe for the ideal horror movie.  Even if horror movies are not to your taste, give "Silence of the Lambs" a fair try - you will be impressed.

My favorite character is the "child catcher with the net."  Why can't there be someone like that in real life especailly with todays kids.  But i digress.Even though i find the kids voice somewhat annoying, the sound that is on this DVD is really great. The THX 5.1 sound catches everything that was originally recorded for the highest highs to the lowest lows. The picture quality is excellent and the film is in it's Roadshow presentation with the Intermission.This film is a total JOY for all ages. And with the ever so talented Dick Van Dyke you simply can not get any better. Sally Ann Howes is a broadway gem of a star as well as the entire cast and somehow you get a found appreciation for Benny Hill who is really totally out of character in this movie. He's wonderful.  This film is a classic and if you a bit down or sad, put this movie on for a great uplifting feeling.

In My Mother's Womb | review/text: Let me preface it to say that there are few films that I would give more than the 5 stars allotted to reviewers.  To say that I love this film is an understatement.  When I saw this film theatrically in 1978(it was the extended director's cut not the original version that played theatres in 1973) I wished that I was in Modesto, California cruising the streets to the sounds of the Wolfman.  This film suggests the kind of director George Lucas could have become if he had not become engrossed with "Star Wars" and ILM.  Our loss.  The story deals with young people on the cusp of adulthood going out for one last fling.  Their stories aren't earth-shaking ones.  John, the rebel, has to usher around an underage girl.  Steve, the responsible one, is trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, Laurie.  Terry, the geek, is trying to make it with a Sandra Dee wanna-be.  Curt, the brain, is pursuing the elusive blonde in the white T-bird.  Along the way various things intrude on these pursuits.  A drag race, a gang initiation, etc.  Lucas has crafted a dream world here that is every much as wonderous as that of "Star Wars".  Enough cannot be said of the period music that comments on the action of the film.  And of course Lucas assembled a largely unknown cast (Richard Dreyfus, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, etc.) who portray young people not dumb teenagers.  One of the devices that Lucas uses to illustrate that youth is a temporary state is show title cards about what happened to the principle characters later in life.  This film illustrates the innocence that was contained in this country prior to the social upheavals that occured later in the 60's.

There are some race issues to be aware of--you do see some of the stereotypes of the day--but young children will not pick up on that and with older kids it's easy to talk to them about it.  The music is outstanding, even the in-between-scenes incidental music sticks with me all day.

I had never really seen this movie before, only bits and pieces. I really enjoyed this hilarious movie, let alone the extra features(about 25 of them).  After watching the movie, I played with all of these.  There are a few &quot;documentaries,&quot; and many extra pictures and drawings.  My favorite features were the theatrical trailers and &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail In Lego.&quot;  &quot;GET ON WITH IT!&quot; Try not to laugh as you watch these extras.

 | product/productId: 6301140974 | review/userId: A3T1YHEP25SGDK | review/summary: Neat story | review/text: Personally, I find that the first three minutes of the movie are the absolute best.  It's a brief view of Mr. Seagal running an Aikido class and demonstrating technique.  Since he is wearing a hakama, his footwork is hard to follow (which is the purpose), and the motions are extreme, but it is interesting to watch.  I'd even be willing to bet that the freestyle sparring is neither choreographed or the blows pulled.  For that bit alone, the movie is worth purchasing.<p>There are a few problems that might cause the purist to cringe.  The goal of Aikido is to execute technique with a minimum of movement, and it is not intended to be as agressive as it is in this movie.<p>Nevertheless, this is a very good movie.  Enough plot to fill the space between the fight scenes, and the fight scenes are very well executed.  As has been pointed out, you realy need to watch the scenes in slow motion to appreciate them, but that's half the fun.<p>Steven Seagal tends to try much too hard, and there are moments where it's just a bit cheesy, but you can't have everything.<p>This is a must view for someone who appreciates the &quot;art&quot; in martial arts (the technique is amazing!), and is probably pretty decent (though a bit slow) for the action movie fan.

Ron Howard did an unbelievable job of keeping up the suspense.  Enough about the movie though, everyone has seen it.<p>All of the extras on the DVD are fantastic.  However, if you're a history buff, and a stickler for historical accuracy, then the commentary with Jim and Marilyn Lovell is what you are looking for.  They go through the entire movie and clear up any embellishments made to improve the &quot;story&quot;.  Most surprisingly you find out that things you thought were made up, are actually true.  It was a very interesting addition.<p>Fantastic all around DVD.  If I didn't own one DVD, I would consider this a candidate for my first.  MUST HAVE!

No point in reapeating these, they say all I think, My contribution to the reviews is simply Director Hayao Miyazaki is someone special. All his Anime are becoming classics, all are excellent, I have 2 now and I will be looking for more. All reviews of his other 4 productions I have searched have 4.5 - 5 ratings and I feel I can understand why after seeing those that I have, I cant wait to check out some more!.<br /><br />I am reasonablly new to anime, I am also an older person, I find some anime are fairly petty, pretty but sadly lack in storyline and depth. Cant say that for KIKI, It is a great story presented very well, and I recommend it to every one. I can also recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away.  (other favorite Animes are Chobits, NOIR, Samurai 7, and Voices of a Distant Star)
 | product/productId: 0800129903 | review/userId: A3MQQS40FK2QAQ | review/summary: Two really cool movies on one disk | review/text: Since this Blu-Ray is two movies on one disk, I have written a double feature review.<br /><br />EL MARIACHI<br /><br />When this film came out in 1993 I only heard bits about it. It wasn't until it came out on VHS tape and later on Laserdisc that I began to take notice. Rodriguez earned $3,000 by volunteering as a lab rat for a month in a medical research hospital, where he wrote the script. With another $4,000 from his friend Carlos Gallardo, he shot this movie in Mexico with the intention of selling it to the Spanish video market. But a copy of the film wound up into the hands of a major Hollywood talent agency. Rodriguez was signed with an agent, which lead to a 2-year development deal with Columbia Pictures.<br /><br />That was what I knew about EL MARIACHI when I sat down to watch it for the first time. When I finished, I thought it was really cool. It doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but it does have plenty of action. And it wasn't until many years later when I watched it again I discovered something else. It is a Mexican Western, like the Man-With-No-Name movies Sergio Leone did with Clint Eastwood. This was especially clear after I read Rodriguez's book: REBEL WITHOUT A CREW, where he gives full detail how he made this movie for $7,000 and what happened after that Hollywood agency got its hands on it.<br /><br />The plot is a Comedy-of Errors type. An unnamed mariachi (Gallardo) comes into a small town in Mexico, intending to follow his father's footsteps and make a name for himself, dressed in black and carrying his guitar in a case. At the same time, a gunman named Azul (Reinol Martinez) arrives dressed in black, carrying a guitar case full of weapons. He also has come to town with a goal, which is established in the opening sequence. He worked for a drug dealer named Moco (Peter Marquardt) and helped him make a lot of money. Now he wants his share of it, and starts killing the dealer's henchmen to get to him, having been double crossed by Moco. Moco sends his men to kill Azul, but they end up mistaking the mariachi and chase after him. At the same time the musician has to fight for his life, he finds some work at a bar, which is owned by a beautiful lady (Consuelmo Gomez)<br /><br />If this plot seems rather simple and obvious, that is actually a small price to pay for the movie. What the film has is an unbelievable amount of energy in it. If you watch carefully, you'll see lots of cutting even when the characters are speaking. This not only helps to prevent the film from getting bogged down, it actually works to keep the film going at the right pace. (The Blu-Ray has the first of a series that Rodriguez has been including in all of his movies: THE TEN MINUTE FILM SCHOOL. For this movie, he explains the real reason why he did the dialogue scenes that way.)<br /><br />The action scenes have a lot of fast cuts in them. A lot of times I complain about this kind of editing in big action movies, but with EL MARIACHI, it isn't an issue. We see automatic weapons firing, and characters getting hit, and the film doesn't look like it actually cost only $7,000, except with the grainy picture and lack of surround sound. It also features a stunt that Gallardo did himself, which also adds to the illusion of a movie costing more than it did.<br /><br />On Blu-Ray, the film is very grainy in appearance. This is because of the main source: the 35mm blown up version of the original negative, which was in 16mm. Next year is the 20th anniversary of this film's theatrical release. Rodriguez should have the film completely re-mastered, using the latest digital technology to clean it up, as well as an audio re-mastering into 5.1 DTS sound. There is also another drawback to this film. The subtitles are in white, and are very hard to see at times. When they were putting this Blu-Ray together, they should've made the subtitles in yellow.<br /><br />(note) Rodriguez included an award winning short film he made in 1990, which proved to him that the feature film was possible: BEDHEAD. This short film is actually really good. All I can say about it is that I laughed out loud while I watched it, and that Rodriguez seemed to have a talent for comedy as well as action.<br /><br />DESPERADO<br /><br />After Rodriguez made an action film for Showtime called ROAD RACERS in early 1994, he made his first Hollywood theatrical release with DESPERADO. The film is a sequel to EL MARIACHI, and it cost $7,000,000. Even in the mid-nineties that is a really low budget for any Hollywood movie. And like EL MARIACHI, it looks like it cost a lot more than that. If you're a Hollywood Executive who funds the cost of a movie, Rodriguez gives you your money's worth. That's what he demonstrates with this movie.<br /><br />I have to give a Spoiler Warning for EL MARIACHI to describe this film. (Read no further if you haven't seen the previous film.) At the end of EL MARIACHI the title character has lost his left hand and his girlfriend. Believing he may never play the guitar again, he took the guitar case full of guns. In DESPERADO we learn that the drug dealer who shot him worked for a bigger drug cartel: Bucho (Joaquin de-Almedia). The mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is determined to kill this man, and makes it clear that he is the only one he wants. But everywhere he goes he winds up in a bloody shoot-out against Bucho's men. As he says to a bartender (Cheech Marin) before he gets killed, "You had to do it the hard way."<br /><br />In addition to looking for Bucho, the mariachi has two other elements to deal with. He saves the life of Carolina (Salma Hyeck), a bookstore owner, and the two end up developing a relationship together. I wouldn't call it a deep relationship, since there is really no time for it. She returns the favor by removing a bullet in his shoulder. The other element he has to deal with is another person who came to town: a knife throwing bad-ass (Danny Trejo). Rodriguez says that Trejo has a great face and intended to use him in all of his future films. The first time I saw him, he looked like a really scary guy you would definitely not want to tangle with.<br /><br />Although this film is indeed a sequel, it is actually Part-II in a trilogy of the Mariachi-with-No-Name. It makes it clear that EL MARIACHI is a Mexican Western. It is strange how this genre easily moves itself into the films from other countries; including Japan. (Akira Kurosawa made his own Samurai Western with YOJIMBO.) But there is something else added to it. In addition to being a Western, DESPERADO is a Mexican John Woo movie.<br /><br />Woo is the Chinese filmmaker whose Hong Kong action films feature an unbelievable amount of stylish gunfire. His main character usually shoots with two 9mm pistols, raking up an incredibly huge body count. Blood flies everywhere in Woo's movies, and he constantly uses slow motion. With the exception of the latter Rodriguez does the same thing. Gunfire erupts all over the place in DESPERADO, with plenty of blood flying everywhere. The action scenes are spectacular, even if some of them look so preposterous.<br /><br />There are some really funny scenes in DESPERADO. It opens with Steve Buscemi telling the story about a gunfight the Mariachi got into, which he ended up witnessing. This follows with the title credits, which reveal that the mariachi had two guitar players as a backup band. They're playing in a bar and deal with a dangerous patron in a comical way. Quentin Tarantino comes in for a cameo, where he tells a really tasteless joke in a bar. Cheech Marin's bartender, who works with a regular in the bar (Tito Larravo), adds his own comic elements. On top of that, Rodriguez throws in an entertaining shootout involving the Mariachi's backup band and a clever use of guitar cases. (More of that, I cannot reveal).<br /><br />Is DESPERADO a masterpiece? Of course, not. Neither is EL MARIACHI. But these films are really entertaining. Rodriguez is a director with tremendous talent, and a lot of creativity. And DESPERADO qualifies as a Kick-Ass Film. (See my review of GRINDHOUSE for a definition of that.)<br /><br />DESPERADO looks much better than EL MARIACHI on Blu-Ray, and takes full advantage of the DTS 5.1 Surround effect. If you have a good 5.1 Home Theater, it makes an excellent demo disc.<br /><br />Both movies feature a running commentary by Rodriguez. What he does is to explain how he made EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO on their incredibly low budgets. His intention, I believe is to inspire young filmmakers into going out and shooting their own action movies at little cost. With the modern HDTV technology today, they can make their films even better, and cheaper.

The story (of this adaptation, NOT of the original novel) is weak in that regard and makes the film a hard-sell due to the expected and anticlimatic resolution. <p>Midway through the movie, the director seemed to have gotten carried away in a semi-doozy theme regarding the right to bear arms which overshadows all common sense. At one point, an idealistic man is even willing to bend the law to achieve his "right" goals. <p>Regardless, the tense Hackman versus Hoffman showdown is by far a reason enough to watch this thriller, there are enough moments between the two veterans to make the ride worthwhile. Living proof a film can be spared, and even succeed, with the likes of Gene Hackman, John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman despite a weak, if not goofy, storyline.

 | product/productId: 0790732084 | review/userId: A3LZGLA88K0LA0 | review/summary: CAPITOL PUNISHMENT | review/text: It's a dark and stormy night at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Under the eternally captured eyes of Washington and Jefferson, a lovely young blonde is having sex in one of the rooms in the White House.  Soon a maid discovers her body in a stall in the restroom.  She has been stabbed to death.  Uh-oh, is this going to be a problem or what?<br /><br />MURDER AT 1600 has a lot of incredible plot contrivances that don't work unless you go ahead, suspend your belief, and enjoy the ride.  Dwight Little's competent direction allows us to do that.  Remember, it's just a movie, and even though its plot seems a bit far-fetched at times, it works as an engrossing thriller.  Wesley Snipes is convincing as a no-nonsense DC homicide detective who forces himself onto the investigation, which should have been federally handled since it took place on Federal property.  But then we wouldn't have had a movie.  Diane Lane in a rare "action" role is marvelous as Dena Chance, the secret service liaison who realizes a cover up is going on.  Daniel Benzali (from the critically acclaimed but short-lived tv series MURDER ONE) chews up the scenery as the head of security and the always delightful Alan Alda gives fine support as the head of NSA.  It was nice to see the still lovely Diane Baker as the First Lady (I remember her so fondly from those 60s tearjerkers and of course as the murderess in STRAIT JACKET); Ronny Cox is an appropriately wimpy president; and Tate Donovan does well in the underdeveloped role of the president's sexually promiscous son.<br /><br />This is one of those aw heck, what the heck kind of movies.  It's fun to watch and I enjoyed it.

Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.<p>This fact aside, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot; is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun. <p>All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive. <p>The songs are excellent, from the familiar &quot;Santa Claus is Coming To Town&quot; to the lovely &quot;My World Is Beginning Today&quot; sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.) <p>The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.<p>This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show. So, do I recommend it, the answer is a resounding YES!!!!!

Classic quotable ad line for the cult hit Trancers back when it played in theaters in 1985.  Yeah, Trancers really played the big screen venues back before video ate up the grindhouse theater chains that booked these exploitive little trash movie gems.  Charles Band (of Full Moon fame) created his own little movie studio, the now defunct Empire Pictures, which scored a megahit with Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator and, from 1983 until 1988 (or 89), released many a great piece of low rent cinema, Trancers being one the tiny studio's bigger non-Stuart Gordon hits (Ghoulies was the other one).<p>Jack Deth is an Angel City cop tracking down the last few Trancers, people who have become mental zombies enslaved to their psychic leader Whistler, who Deth singed (slang for dispatch revolver style) on one of the 'Rim Worlds'.  But it turns out that Whistler is not dead, he has gone 'down the line' to wipe out the current Angel City Council members family lines.  Deth has to go back in time, to 1985 Los Angeles, and snag Whistler before he rewrites the future to his power mad liking.<p>Although Trancers has plot holes and paradoxes you can drive several highways through, the script manages some real wit and fun with its premise and character actor Tim Thomerson is obviously having a blast playing Deth.  The Full Moon (now Koch Distributing) DVD is just a copy of the Vestron Video laserdisc release, presenting the movie in full frame and offering up some bios and filmographies of the various actors.  40 trailers for most of Band's Full Moon output is offered on the b-side and that makes this disc all the more worth having.  Recommended.
 | product/productId: 6301304993 | review/userId: A1H5E7O5BW2J13 | review/summary: An Unsettling, Haunting, Creepy, and Beautiful Film | review/text: I have to admit, whenever I watch a black and white French movie, it's like watching paint dry. I don't care how poetic or artsy the film is. Usually I find them to be pretentious, long, boring, and annoyingly uneventful. Les Yeux San Visage (Eyes Without A Face) surprised me. I wasn't expecting anything brilliant, but I wasn't expecting anything that bad either. After all, the plot is original and haunting in itself. I'm not really a fan of scary movies either--i just think they're funny and so over the top. But just like Rosemary's Baby, among other horror films that are more psychological than suspensful, Eyes Without A Face is haunting and creepy for its unsettling images. Such as Christiane's mask and her distorted face. Or her father's sick obsession with luring in young women and surgically removing their face to put on his daughter's, no matter how many times he had to do it after the last attempt failed (and ultimately led to the victim's death). But what also sets this film apart from other horror films is its beauty and sadness. Such as Christiane's dour eyes, the only thing that we get to see up close throughout the movie with her mask on. And her father's dedication to repair his daughter's face. But most sadly, how this father's love isolates Christiane from the outside world, from the life she once lived, and from being the person she used to be. This is honestly the real reason to watch this movie: for the idea, the raw human emotion that revolves around it, and to examine the emotional and moral consequences of today's obsession with plastic surgery (specifically, of those plastic surgeries that go tragically wrong). Not to mention that the doctor's surgical procedure on this helpless young lady is one of the most digusting and horrifying scenes I've ever seen on film!<br /><br />However, the main problem with this film is that it has nothing else to offer in between. When we don't see the doctor doing the surgical procedure, throwing dead girls into underground rooms or what not, or see Christiane searching through his lab, the movie is so dull that it can possibly put you to sleep. In other words, it's not consistent. That's not to say that the whole movie needed to be creepier than what it is, but something eventful should have at least happened in between. Also, in some sense I felt like the characters were flat, if not boring. Maybe if they were a bit more detailed about HOW Christiane became disfigured (all we know is that it happened after a tragic car accident...did the car catch on fire, which led her skin to literally disappear from her face?), and even HOW her father was the cause of it (all we know is that he was "driving like a lunatic"...and?...). It just left me a bit lost and confused. A little flashback could have done it, nothing too graphic, just more detailed. Christiane's father was alright, but at times i wondered what led him to go this far. Mostly, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of characterization in Christiane. Yes, pretty much she's acting with her eyes, expressing the depths of her sad soul, while the mask is the frame that lets us see only the eyes and not her distorted face. But why didn't she speak out to her father about his wrongdoing? She lost her face, not her vocal chords! She's not afraid to express how she feels to her father's assistant, so what's stopping her from telling how she feels to her dad? I could understand if she has once or twice confronted her dad about his evil deed, only to have him become more obsessed and to completely ignore her pain. But no, instead she stays quiet throughout the whole movie, and at the end, feeds her father to the dogs as if he sacrificed so much only for himself and not for her. Yes, of course the man deserved it, but from the daughter's point of view, it seems cruel. After all, he loved her, so much that he killed many girls just to get a face that would eventually decay after the procedure.<br /><br />But oh well. As I said before, this movie is unsettling, haunting, creepy, and beautiful for its sick plot idea, grotesque imagery, and for the fact that it's a pretty nice looking, poetic, and well-made film for its time. It's not a classic to die for (no pun intended), but if you want to watch a horror film that's original and haunting, then check out this one.
 | product/productId: 0783230818 | review/userId: A152C8GYY25HAH | review/summary: Savage satire is one of my favorites of 1998 | review/text: Somebody's not telling the truth about this movie. The studio emphasized that "Primary Colors" was not intentionally based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. The writer of the book it's based on was written by "Anonymous". The real author turned out to be Joe Klien, who works for The New Yorker Magazine. He says the book was, in fact, based on Clinton's first Presidential campaign.<p>John Travolta and Emma Thompson play Jack and Susan Stanton. Jack is Governor of an unnamed Southern State. The couple looks a whole like Bill and Hillary, both in body language and in appearance. <p>When the film came out last Spring, it did fairly good business. It was viewed as a political satire, which it is. In fact, it's one of the best films of its kind in a long time. Some would mention "Wag the Dog" in the same breath as "Primary Colors". The former was certainly a fine movie, but "Colors" is witty, rambunctious, smart and, well, a whole lot like the Clintons!<p>I suppose it has a slightly darker feel to it now, with all the bad press and publicity Mr. Clinton has lately gotten. Before all the disclosures about Clinton's private life, the movie seemed almost innocent. Now it seems prophetic. It's as though "Primary Colors" mutated into a different form. Or could it be that, after the revelations were made about The President, the nation suffered from a case of Mass Denial?<p>The irony is that the character of Jack Stanton is seen as an intelligent, well intentioned man, who has a bit of a problem with his fly. <p>Whatever its parallels with real life, it stands on its own as a good picture. The focus is on John Travolta's character, but Thompson's Susan doesn't get off lightly either. That is because, no matter how much Stanton fools around, the couple is always united in its pursuit of power. This is made clearly evident in two scenes. In the first one, Susan is sobbing and being held by Henry [Adrian Lester], a young and affable political aide. Susan has just found out about another one of Jack's affairs, and she is furious at him and at all who kept it secret from her. The film cuts straight to the second scene, where Susan is shown as all business again, throwing herself into the campaign. This sudden shift in her moods is done on purpose to underline how nothing in this world will alter her mission.<p>Mike Nichols is in top directing form. He really hasn't done as many movies as people might think. He's just done some of the most famous, such as "The Birdcage", "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "The Graduate".<p>Travolta and Thompson are so good that they are almost spooky. Emma Thompson is one of the great actresses of our times. While nobody paid much attention to him for many years, I think many are coming to realize that Travolta is one of our great actors. <p>As Richard, a brilliant but insane political ally, Billy Bob Thornton shines again. It never ceases to amaze me how much Thornton's physical appearance can change from role to role. For the record, he was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas. <p>Kathy Bates threatens to steal the show at times in her dynamic turn as a political aide Stanton hires. She been in an asylum for the last fifteen years!<p>The script by Elaine May has some of the best dialog of any film released in this decade.<br />For example, Stanton checks into his motel at some campaign stop. He looks around and say, "What? No cable TV? What the [blank] were you thinking. of? You can't run for President of the Untied States without [blank] CNN!".<p>Mike Nichols and Elaine May were, many years ago, the top standup comedy team of their time. It's wonderful to see them reunited in this way - he directing, she writing. Still a team!

I thought it had a really good story, something which is often lacking in movies these days. The fantasy and romance aspects were, I thought, well done. In the end, the curse is undone, the bad guy gets his dues, and the lovers are reunited!<br /><br />I thought the acting of the male lead (Rutger Hauer) was a little understated. But then, it was SO refreshing to see a movie like this that wasn't full of arguing, yelling, and stupid, overdone special effects.<br /><br />The only irritating aspect is the character of Phillipe. Early in the movie, he talks too much, far more than a man on the run would. But his character improves as the story goes on.<br /><br />Good entertainment, especially if you like medieval-style fantasy.
 | product/productId: 079283867X | review/userId: AB7ZFVBGLOCA6 | review/summary: Eddie Rocks | review/text: What is is about film reviewers that they always forget what it is like to be a kid again? Eddie does that, takes me back to when I was a kid. The cool cars and the music that when you sat back and listened had meaning unlike the doff doff of today. This movie is about a band and their lead singer Eddie who is gifted to the point of not being able to relate or communicate to other band members other than to mesmerise than with his interperation of music and what it takes to acheive greatness. It also shows the dark side of the music industry in that they destroy the band, Eddie in particular. The soundtrack to this movie is grossly underrated and I have often laughed at the reference to the E Street Band as this would have been a giant album had it been released in the 60's as it is in the movie.

This is simply the greatest movie in American Cinema History.  The acting is superb, especially Davis and Sanders.

 | product/productId: 6300214176 | review/userId: A28GCEHD00JFZG | review/summary: Shoegazing | review/text: My Bloody Valentine (1981): 5 out of 10: Apparently, if you repeat the mantra 'this was a classic cult horror film', people may begin to believe you. In particular, if they are young people, who were not yet born when this movie came out in 1981, and they are starring in the 3-d remake coming out in 2009.<br /><br />My Bloody Valentine is a remake (rip-off) of sorts as well. In fact, it is almost plot point for plot point a remake of Halloween. Same escaped mental patient killer as Halloween, same holiday theme as well. They do downshift the social status of the victims by replacing an Illinois suburb with a Canadian mining town, but other than that, it is a very similar film.<br /><br />My Bloody Valentine found itself In competition with such films as Mother's Day and April Fools Day, (One can be thankful that Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday was not a nationally recognized holiday in the early eighties. One shudders to imagine that holiday themed slasher film.)<br /><br />The film is famous in some circles for getting all of its gore cut out by the ratings board. Combined with a complete (and surprising, considering the actresses and subject matter) lack of nudity, filmgoers in the early eighties could easily have wondered how the film got an R rating at all.<br /><br />Fortunately, a rerelease of the 1981 film on DVD to coincide with the theatrical 3-d remake reinserts the lost footage. Unfortunately, they did not spend the extra money to remaster said footage so it fits in with the rest of the film. As a result, we get a strange spaghetti vision every time a gore scene starts. Despite this, it is an improvement on the original theatrical cut. No amount of edits could solve the fundamental script problems the film suffers from (even by genre standards); and the lackluster killer the movie is saddled with.<br /><br />Overall My Bloody Valentine is a watchable slasher film, especially for those who like the early eighties slasher classics. It could have used more gore and nudity and a much better plot. Something its 3-d remake delivers in spades.

I am not a horror fan by any means, but this movie is more comedy than horror, and it's a film that I enjoy every time I see it. I bought it so that I could view it with a bunch of guys, and they all agreed it was worth seeing. I haven't seen either of the 'Evil Dead' movies but may do so, sometime in the future. The HD side played fine for 10 minutes, and then pooped out, so we flipped it over and played the regular DVD side, which due to upconversion seemed the same to me. I don't think the disc was the problem--my friends HD player has had similar problems in the past. If you want a fun movie with some horror, some action, and lots of humor (including references to many other movies), see 'Army of Darkness'

It works out that if Polly  voluntarily adopts a charming baby boy, she gets to keep her job at  freshman romantic-lead David (Niven)'s family business, showcase her  jitterbug, and even find real romance.  I never realized how delightful and  funny Rogers could be, in this mainly non-dancing romantic comedy.

 | product/productId: 630196909X | review/userId: A3UHINVAIUVGN8 | review/summary: It's JUDY, what else do you need? | review/text: Here it is.  Judy Garland.  In one of her many top-grossing MGM musicals.  In restored technicolor.  With restored stereophonic sound in some areas.  On DVD.  Yes, the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true!<br />Garland was in peak physical and emotional condition when this film was shot, and at the beginning, it was to be an "old west" musical answer to Garland's "Meet Me In St. Louis," released in 1944.  Watching Garland in ANY film, whether she is Dorothy on her way to see the Wizard of Oz, or here, as Susan Bradley, on her way to the wild west to answer a matrimonial ad in her Ohio hometown newspaper, Garland's ability to make the viewer BELIEVE that she is Susan Bradley (as opposed to Judy Garland PLAYING Susan Bradley) is extraordinary.  Garland's acting ability is flawless, and she displays all the elements in this film that led no less an authority than director George Cukor to say that she was "the world's greatest, most profound actress."  Garland's husband, esteemed director Vincente Minnelli, said that "the surface hadn't been scratched with Judy.  She could do anything.  As good as ANY of the greatest actresses that ever lived."<br />Although "The Harvey Girls" was, as most of Garland's MGM films were, a lighthearted escapist venture with great songs and Garland's indescribable chemistry, it gives hints at the depth of her artistry as an actress.  If you are only aware of Judy Garland through "The Wizard of Oz," I urge you to view this film.<br />It is a great introduction to the genius and artistry of Judy Garland.<br />Director George Sidney's comments about the film are available as one of the bonus features, and his insights and accolades of Garland match those statements made by her co-stars in this film, and by any and all that worked with her, and came under her spell, during her 45 year career.  As a movie critic said in 1963, "she is Judy.  She is the very best there is."  Nearly 40 years after that statement was made, and over 30 years after Garland's untimely death, she is STILL the very best there is, and "The Harvey Girls" is a tune filled, happy musical that only underscores those sentiments.

In this instance, an extremely distant pair of parents and a young man seeking his identlty. It's also about great psychological drama, superior period design and unbelievably assured freshman filmmaking from director Mike Van Diem. It's also, as the title implies, about &quot;building character.&quot; The father, Dreverhaven, has some unusual character building techniques, to put it mildly. He at one point tells the young man's mother that he will strangle 9/10s of the life out of son Jacob, but the remaining 1/10ths will make him strong. And just for good measure, he may take the last tenth as welll. <p> Jan Decleir, as Dreverhaven, is a revelation. He's built like Gerard Depardieu and is even more preposessing than that fine actor on screen. He would make a great Javert or Lear in some future production. Victor L&ouml;w, as Jacob's mentor and elder friend, De Gankeelar, is unlike anyone you will have seen on screen or stage. With an impossibly jutting jaw and unique mode of speech, he is the ultimate character actor. The entire cast is splendid. I'm not at all familiar with Dutch Cinema, and am not even entirely sure the term isn't an oxymoron. This film, however, can stand beside anything in contemporary cinema. Now I just have to dig up the novel by Ferdinand Borewijk, from which the movie was adapted. It's such a compelling story that I'm sure the novel will be excellent, as well.<p>Five Stars and counting.<p>BEK

In this DVD age I WANT TO OWN THE DVD of this series.  The video isn't good enough.

I was watching it and suddenly there were scenes that were NOT in the theatrical release! One was of Keating and the Latin teacher having a talk in their office. Another was of Keating and Neil having a talk. I've always wanted to see those scenes again but the DVD has no deleted scenes. If anyone knows where to get them, let us know. This film is brilliant.
 | product/productId: 0783226063 | review/userId: A14A7WXGQ67V5N | review/summary: Was There Not Enough Support To Do This Movie Justice? | review/text: As a dedicated fan of the original movie I couldn't wait to get this new extended edition. I have never been quite as disappointed by a DVD release. Perhaps I was expecting way too much, but who can blame me, in this day and age of digital re-mastering and re-working. Look at what ILM did to restore the original Star Wars trilogy. The theatrical release of Dune may have its foibles and faults, but I believe many would agree with me that it is a brilliant Sci-Fi classic, and deserved the same kind of loving restoration as Star Wars. Was there just not enough money or support out there for Dune to do it justice?<br /><br />I gather that the Sci-Fi channel has been airing this same extended version of Dune - I suppose if I'd seen that I would have been better prepared for what comes on the DVD. Alas I will never support the Sci-Fi channel again after how they mishandled Farscape.<br /><br />I realize this is just one fan's opinion, but I can't justify more than two stars for the extended version of the movie (the theatrical release remains one of my favorite films of all time). I find it impossible to believe that they didn't go in to the restored scenes and add the blue-on-blue effect for the eyes of the Fremen. The character's faces are so critically important to every scene that this omission is instantly noticeable, even in long distance shots.<br /><br />Another major disappointment is the new narrator. Unlike the original hauntingly beautiful narration by Princess Irulan, this narrator's gravely voice is jarring and does not fit with the tone or mood of the film at all. Nor does he pronounce many key terms in the same way as the characters in the movie (e.g., Sardukar), which is sloppy and takes away from the richness of the fantasy universe. Even if someone told me the narrator was Frank Herbert's son or David Lynch, I still think this style of narration was a poor choice that detracts from the film a lot. My wife and I found ourselves dreading the next time there would be narration in a scene - which happened far too often, and often in seemingly random places. It's not that I'm against narration - I'm a huge fan of the original Blade Runner; I loved the narration by Harrison Ford, it fit the mood of the film perfectly and drew my imagination deeper into the Blade Runner world.<br /><br />The extended version of Dune also makes extensive use of new artwork in conjunction with the new narrator, first to create a lengthy prologue, and then scattered throughout the film to remind us what planet we are on. I can't say it's terrible artwork, it has the look of quickly painted concept art.  But again, it just does not fit in with the look of the film. The paintings of the planets have such a rough, sketchy look that when they pop up you are jarred back out of the story and reminded that you are just watching a movie. It creates the feeling you are seeing an unfinished preliminary cut of the film, where storyboards are inserted to mark where special effects will be added later.<br /><br />Hard core Dune fans will already own their copy of this release, and like me, be pretty glad they do. But I bet I speak for many when I say we are still waiting for that "ultimate director's edition." Come on David Lynch, wherever you are, we know you did the best you could, and we love what you did. Now give us an extended version that we fans can watch again and again, instead of just once out of curiosity.

I had heard nothing but bad reviews when it was released to theaters, so I had decided early on that I wouldn't even waste my time.  My sister, however, insisted that I had to see it.  I figured out part of the "twist" pretty quickly, but there was so much more to it than I had expected.  What an adventure!  You can't go into this movie with any preconceived notions; you just have to let yourself enjoy it for what it is . . . a great story with a huge heart and characters you can really feel for.  I truly loved this movie, although it will be a while before I want to see it again.  It was quite an earthshaker to me.  Bryce Dallas Howard has a huge award-winning career ahead of her if she sticks to the right roles.

Thought my review is one of the hundreds here ^.^ I thought i should share my thoughts on this film which has moved me in a new direction.<br /> First of all, this is a GREAT family film, ok....the scene with Mrs. Potiphar is a bit *bizarre* and it does seem to imply something more.... (But i think one of the best parts of movies like this are scenes like that, ones you can watch early in life and then look back when your older and go YIKES! lol..) ok..going on..-four words- MARIA FRIEDMAN KICKS #%@#!!!! She ties this whole production together and has an amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast, the thought provoking part is with this(chemistrys like the one between the Narrator and Joseph is very dangerous to a fanfiction driven 15 year old spazzy teenage girl^.^)<br />  Anyway, my little cousins LOVE this movie and watch it whenever I come over(me being the big Maria Friedman fan). Donny Osmond is wonderful as Joseph, especially during &quot;Close Every Door&quot; and Benjamin Calypso (we understand how hard it must have been to not laugh during that) Robert Torti is a hysterical pharaoh, and everyone just is sensational!! This is a definate DVD to add to you collection!!!!!!!!!! Spread the colored coatness!!!!!

 | product/productId: 0792833201 | review/userId: AQ01Q3070LT29 | review/summary: The "poltergeists" are in this house. | review/text: This is the film that must be seen in a theatre and on a big screen.  Definatly a "lights out" film.<br /> Please don't let your young children watch this one.<br />  What I really appreciate about this film is showing a loving and caring family with good morals with the children.<br /> This film directed by Tobe Hooper and the screenplay written by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor, based on a story by Steven Spielberg, was a total surprise and is a word-of-mouth hit.  I saw the film in 1982 not knowing what the film was about.  I just simply saw the advertisement in a magazine and went to go see it at night.  I never heard of the word, "poltergeist" before and didn't even know what it was until I saw this eye-opening film.<br />  So that others are surprised too, I will not reveal the special effects or most of the plot of the film.  it must be seen from the very start to the very end.<br />  It appears to be a normal middle-income tract of modern homes in the town of Cuesta Verde, California (it's actually Simi Valley, California and Agoura Hills, California).  The Freelings are a normal family in every way.  There is Diane (JoBeth Williams, the mother of three who laughs and loves with her husband, Steven (Craig T. Nelson).  They have a typical teenager, Dana (Dominique Dunne), a nice son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and a young daughter, Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke).<br />  Strange, unexplainable phenomenon is beginning to happen in the Freeling house.  The little girl can hear voices in the television after the channel has signed off for the night.  Okay, she's a little girl, no harm.  But the next night is a real stormy one and the next night even worse.  When the "poltergeists" invade the home, the Freeling's life will never be the same.<br />  Good, strong ensemble cast.  Excellent acting from all, especially JoBeth Williams.<br />  Also in the cast: Beatrice Straight, Zelda Rubinstein, Richard Lawson, James Karen, Dirk Blocker, Michael McManus, Virginia Kiser, Robert Broyles, Sonny Landham.<br /><br />  Famous Line: "They're here!" (Heather O'Rourke).<br /><br />  Sad note: Dominique Dunne was at home October 30, 1982 rehearsing with actor-friend David Packer for the "V" The Final Battle (1984) tv mini-series.  Her former boyfriend, John Thomas Sweeney who was very abusive to her, came over and dragged her outside, strangled her and left her brain dead. David Packer called the police.<br />  The Police did arrive and John Thomas Sweeney was arrested.<br />Dominique Dunne was removed off of life support 5 days later.<br />  This was the beginning of the Hollywood-hyped "Poltergeist curse".<br /><br />  Also Oliver Robins had a real scary incident during a scene with the clown doll.  Steven Spielberg thought he was just acting and even told him to "keep going", but not until he saw Robins face did he realize the boy was really in trouble.  Spielberg finally ran over to the boy and released the puppet off of Robins.<br /><br />  Lou Perryman died ASpril 1, 2009. He was murdered in his Texas home. He played "Pugsley", a pool construction worker, in Poltergeist (1982).<br /><br />  Sequels:<br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYLWUI">Poltergeist II: The Other Side</a> (1986).<br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWALHC">Poltergeist III</a> (1988).<br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CEV3MI">Poltergeist - The Legacy - Season 1</a> (1996-1999)tv series.

 | product/productId: 0792836510 | review/userId: A2Q13PHEXGR48Q | review/summary: A must have DVD for movie fans | review/text: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Extended Version Collector's Set is an amazing DVD that is a must have for fans of spaghetti westerns, Clint Eastwood, and Sergio Leone. Most people know the storyline of three violent men and their pursuit of $200,000 in Confederate gold coins buried in a cemetery. Allowing nothing to slow them down, the trio cuts a violent path to the gold. For the extended version DVD, 14 minutes of footage has been added to the movie that were never part of the American release. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach re-recorded the dialogue in these scenes because an English audio track was never created. It is almost forty years since the movie was made and Eastwood and Wallach have aged which is noticeable in their voices, but that doesn't detract from the overall viewing pleasure of the movie. My only problem with the DVD is the gunshots. Spaghetti westerns had a distinctive noise when guns were fired. Here on this DVD the gunshots have been changed to a more Americanized gunshot. Minor squabble, but I had to get it off my chest. Even with this minor problem this is an incredible DVD that fans of the movie need to have in their collection.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie, "the Good," a bounty hunter who by accident discovers the name of the grave where the gold coins are buried. Lee Van Cleef is equally as good as the steely-eyed Angel Eyes, "the Bad," a vicious gunfighter who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold. Eli Wallach steals the movie as Tuco, "the Ugly," the Mexican bandit who knows the name of the cemetery, but not the name on the grave. The trio are great throughout, providing plenty of great shootouts, but also some great dialogue. The movie also stars Luigi Pistilli as Father Ramirez, Tuco's brother, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Aldo Guiffre as an alcoholic Union captain, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli, and Al Mulock.<br /><br />The Extended Version Collector's Set is full of extras viewers will eat up. The DVD features the widescreen presentation of the movie with 14 additional minutes of footage, audio commentary from film critic Richard Schickel, "Leone's West" a making of documentary with cast(Eastwood and Wallach) and crew interviews, "The Leone Style" a featurette about director Sergio Leone's unique style, "The Man Who Lost the Civil War" a documentary about the actual happenings of the Civil War that take place in the movie, "Reconstructing the GBU" on how the audio recording was done, and "Il Maestro" a feature about composer Ennio Morricone and his famous score. The DVD also has two deleted scenes that weren't able to be inserted into the movie, a French trailer with other missing footage, a US trailer that identifies Tuco as the Bad and Angel Eyes as the Ugly, several collectible mini-posters from around the world, and a collectible booklet with an essay by Roger Ebert. If you have the original DVD, I recommend you keep it just to have the original US release, but buy this DVD as well. This Extended Version DVD is truly one of the few movies you can say is a must have DVD. Buy this movie!

 | product/productId: 0792841484 | review/userId: AGLDQK4S01KPH | review/summary: MARIE WINDSOR-THE KILLING-WOW! | review/text: Director Stanley Kubrick's first "major" film was this vastly entertaining noir,"The Killing",dealing with the robbery of a Northern California race track engineered by ex-con Sterling Hayden.(great!)His "gang" includes such character actor stan-outs as Jay C.Fliipen,Joe Sawyer,Ted deCorsia,as a dishonest cop,Timothy Carey(as a sniper),and the noir immortal Elisha Cook,Jr.(The Maltese Falcon,The Big Sleep)and as Cook's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife Marie Windsor.Miss Windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed,but you will NEVER close your eyes while Marie is on screen,mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie,which she wares most spectacularly. Marie is great as Cook's disguisted wife,who pours out her vemomous insults toward's her little Georgie non stop and without remorse.Naturally,she is not (sexually and otherwise)satisified with George so she has a younger boyfriend on the side,played by a youthful Vince Edwards.The plans for the heist are all hush/hush,but George in order in impress Sherry(MW) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.Sherry, who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for Georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend's help,needless to say one seductive glance by Marie and Edwards is hooked.So when part of the gang meets to split the heist money,Hayden is late,the surprise will take place.The robbery goes OK,but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose!<br /><br />  Kubrick's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along,at a fast pace.The film is only eighty minutes.Sterling Hayden,who at one time I could not stand as an actor (I was a kid when I thought that way)gives his greatest performance to date,only to be topped by his role in Dr.Strangelove(also directed by Kubrick),and in the first Godfather film,as a dishonest Irish Police Inspector.Coleen Gray as Hayden's loyal girlfriend is fine,I believe here career should have been more productive,as she should have been given better roles.She her In Red River,as Wayne's girlfriend,and as Ty Power's naive wife in the noir classic "Nightmare Alley".But this is MARIE WINDSOR'S show and she runs away with it!If you love noir you will LOVE this film!

That kind of mixture of sheer rage, pain, disappointment and the uncontrollable need to cry. This film was strictly made for those Batman fans who eat through a straw and wear a helmet everywhere they go. It is insulting to think that the big wigs at Warner Bros. thought they could distribute this to the same audience that liked the original "Batman" in 1989. Comparing the two is like comparing a toilet seat to a sunset. But seriously, this film was intended to make money and nothing more. They obviously didn't care about the legacy of what Bob Kane created or what fans had come to expect. Fans expect a more macabre feeling to their batman movies. Almost like a science-fiction/noir. This film is an adaptation more or less of the "Batman" T.V. series in the 1960's; not the true Batman that people like Frank Miller understand. With corny jokes from all around the cast (yes, even batman has a few), corny dialogue all throughout the movie, horrible acting, a sub-third grade level plot, and bad enough lighting, camera-working and original score to make it seem like a musical, this movie almost single-handedly brought down the entire Batman film franchise. If you are a total batman junkie and just can't get enough of all things Bat, than rent this movie, but I"m willing to bet that even you will want to burn it afterwards. This movie is so bad, its almost fun to watch for that reason, if it were not trying to be seriously passed off as a Batman movie.

Taken from Tom Clancy's superb novel, PATRIOT GAMES is one of the best action films ever made. Much to Alec Baldwin's dismay, action man Harrison Ford took over the role of the CIA agent Jack Ryan, and he does an even better job of the character than Baldwin did. Philip Noyce (DEAD CALM) does a terrific job with the action, and the sharp script elevates this above standard action fare. A must-see film for Clancy and Harrison Ford fans.
 | product/productId: 6300268888 | review/userId: A319SKSB556033 | review/summary: Go back. Go...beyond. | review/text: Some spoilers perhaps!<br /><br />Since the original Poseidon Adventure raked in so much dough, Irwin Allen wanted to get a sequel off the ground right away. It would eventually take him 7 years to get it made and in that space of time it would go through many changes.<br /><br />To begin with, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure was to star Borgnine, Buttons and the rest of the survivors. After being rescued by the French Coast Guard they were to be transported to safety by train through the French Alps. A tunnel cave-in was to trap them all over again amid other, more sinister, drama.<br /><br />That idea was soon squashed. Hackman didn't want to return (as Reverend Scott's brother!) and even though poster art was created (you can still find the train/gun image out there), that's about as far as production got. Allen focused on making other movies for the time being. Then, in 1978 he asked Paul Gallico to write a sequel. Gallico obliged but died before Beyond was published. His novel had Rogo, Martin and Manny Rosen being forced at gunpoint to return to the ship to plunder its secret cargo. Bandits, pirates, double-crosses and macabre plot developments followed.<br /><br />Unable to convince Borgnine and the others to return at this point, Allen changed the story to accommodate a bunch of new characters. This Mike Rogo became Mike Turner (Michael Caine) and Bandits and Pirates became Stefan Svevo (Television Savalas) and his group of terrorists.<br /><br />Beginning just before the storm in which the Poseidon capsized, Turner and his crew (Sally Field and Karl Malden) are out in Jenny the Tugboat. Turner loses his cargo and worries about the bank taking his precious boat away. New Years Day arrives and the sea is calm once again. Turner sees the French Coast Guard chopper buzzing overhead and figures there must be something interesting over the horizon.<br /><br />Interesting indeed. An abandoned 5-star, world-class super-liner designed to carry hundreds of wealthy passengers. There's sure to be riches to plunder and a quick trip down to the Purser's Office (the idiot who chose to die in the first) might save Jenny from the banks greedy hands.<br /><br />'Doctor' Stefan Svevo (trying saying that while drunk) and his group of suspicious men dressed in impeccably white clothes follow Turner inside, hoping to save some remaining survivors. Yeah right! Svevo just happens to be after a secret cargo of guns and plutonium and has an agent still stuck on-board.<br /><br />Turner and his crew find the Purser's safe quite easy and load up on the loot. But they also find a bunch of stranded passengers including a very young-looking Peter Boyle, Slim Pickens, Mark Harmon and Jack Warden as a blind writer. His quick trip to pinch the riches turns into the much more noble task of leading the rest to safety. But once they discover Svevo's plot a fight breaks out.<br /><br />I think that BTPA has had an unfair amount of criticism. Until the 2006 DVD release the film suffered 27 years of pan and scan TV screenings and videos, which completely screws up the scope photography. Seeing the film in widescreen, as intended, gives it a much slicker look. But I wasn't too impressed with the set-decoration and lighting. The Poseidon was already trashed and unstable before the first survivors escaped. By now it should be seriously threatening to sink or explode and the sets should reflect how much stress the ship is under. But they do look too spotless and the lighting is too bright and un-atmospheric. And, just so you know, a ship of this size would have more than one kitchen. So moans about it 'already being flooded' are invalid.<br /><br />And I do think that the ending is kind of abrupt and rushed. It was a bit of a let-down having finish with such a lame, flippant finale. And, despite, previous criticisms, I do think that the characters are just as good as before. I felt sorry for Jack Warden when his wife died, or when Michael Caine realised that he lost the gold. Wilbur (Karl Malden) was a good character too and I think that his exit from the film was less than what he deserved. There is also more continuity with the original than the negative reviews proclaim. So don't let that put you off.<br /><br />It's had a bad reputation, but BTPA isn't as bad as pretentious movie zealots would have you think. If you are a fan of the original then it is at least worth a rental.<br /><br />The DVD features a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture with Dolby Mono sound (a bit of a downer since the first was in 6-Track Surround). It also contains a vintage a TV featurette running about 30 minutes and a couple of trailers.

Other than "Dances with Wolves" it is the only movie i've seen that portrays Native Americans as caring, intelligent and basically peace-loving people, fighting only to protect what is, by he laws of nature, rightfully theirs. Although the time period is over 100 years later than "Dances with Wolves", the "civilized" characters are still drawn to the spiritual love of nature that does not exist in American life. The lure of the Native Americans' respect for. and belief in. the power of nature are not romanticized or contrived; they simply offer an attractive, spiritual alternative to a skeptical, angry, untrusting modern American society that no longer has the ability to believe in what is not rational and cannot even consider that something  could be possible even if it does not seem probable. Because the setting of the chance meeting between whites and Native Americans is at the end of the 20th century, when logically Native Americans should not still live undetected in the wilds od the Oxbow, the plot and the characters are not romanticized but inatead reveal to skeptics that such chance happenings, while "logically"improbable, are so appealingly possible.<br /><br />I had never seen the movie until it recently ran on A&E twice within a couple of weeks. I watched it and loved it both times.and would watch it periodically whenever I needed to be reassured "there are more things in heaven and earth than are drempt of in [our] philosophy." "The Last of the Dogmen" should definitely be re-released, thus allowing viewers to see that occasionally fantasy could become reality.
 | product/productId: 6301976126 | review/userId: A1IR1HS8EZN0Y0 | review/summary: &quot;AN APPLE MADE OF ARSENIC.&quot; | review/text: One of the problems with studying in film school, being a movie buff and getting older is that at some point in ones' life a man ventures into the video store, peruses the shelves and reaches the conclusion that he has seen every movie worth seeing.<p>I thought I was getting there until a few years ago when I heard about and checked out &quot;The Sweet Smell of Success&quot;. It was like that with &quot;Chinatown&quot;, which I never saw until the 1990s and now consider one of the best films ever.<p>&quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; holds up totally even though it is black-white, set in 1957. Burt Lancaster is J.J., based on Walter Winchell, who was a leading accuser of Communists in the media.<p>Tony Curtis is a lackey publicist who lives on the whim of those who pay him to place items in various columns, which means he must grovel at the feet of clients and columnists. J.J. plays him like a fiddle. This has lines so vitriolic and perfect, Frank Manciewics in &quot;All About Eve&quot; is no more biting, and Bette Davis in &quot;Eve&quot; bites with the best of 'em.<p>Lancaster just fills the screen with irony and sardonic, hurtful wit. Curtis fends it off with skill, it is like a fencing match. Anybody who has any desire to study dialogue must watch and memorize this. Everything is tremendous; the acting, the directing, the score, the noir shadows of New York at night. The music is unreal, lots of horns, filling the room with its wailing sobs of a corrupt, naked city.<p>A love story between J.J.'s little sis and a musician (Martin Milner I think, who was in &quot;Adam 12&quot;), is the heart of the story. It is the one true, good thing, but J.J. is a monster. Perhaps Bob Towne had this in mind when he cast John Huston to be an incestuos father in &quot;Chinatown&quot;. The inference, being the '50s, is much more subtle but it seems J.J. has the hots for sis and wants nobody to have her. He brands the musician a Commie, using sycophant secondary journalists to keep his own hands clean. <p>Any chance for this dark one to have a happy ending goes down the tubes when sis, as much to torment her bro, kills herself. Curtis is utterly ammoral. His picture appears in Webster's next to the word ammoral. <p>Many films have played off this theme. &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; (1996, Kevin Spacey, Frank Whaley) comes to mind. If this could be 20 stars I'd give it 20.<p>Steven Travers<br />Author of &quot;Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman&quot;<br />straversca@aol.com

 | product/productId: 6300267938 | review/userId: A2BSZPRBKYAB2K | review/summary: The story of how "Cowboys" become "Cattlemen", John Wayne style | review/text: Another great movie with John Wayne.  The story of how a dozen or so schoolboys become men by leading a cattle drive.  John Wayne plays "Will Anderson" owner of a ranch and herd of cattle that need to be driven to market.  He has to hire local schoolboys because all the other men around his area are on "gold fever" absence.  This is a great story and excellent acting.  Roscoe Lee Browne is the cook during the cattledrive and is full of wisdom and mystery, Bruce Dern is the bad guy who "oozes" evil from the very beginning.  Robert Carradine is one of the cowboys so is A. Martinez.  This is one of the few movies in which John Wayne's character doesen't survive, but he sure does give the bad guy a big "whoopin".  I like this movie because you see an older John Wayne.  He is grizzled, tough yet tender, and shows the young cowboys how to be men by leading by example.  A great film that is highly recommended!

 | product/productId: 6302120527 | review/userId: AJIH1NJ9N28D9 | review/summary: "It's the world against us and us against the world!" | review/text: Oh so dashing Errol Flynn is Peter Blood, a doctor thrown into slavery without just cause.  Fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates!  Arrrrrrrgh!<br /><br />Highly entertaining from beginning to end, normally when a film gets boring I bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here!  This film didn't let up for a minute.  Even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, who by the way is smoking hot in this movie.<br /><br />Another reason to get this DVD or even better yet the Flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called "Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born".  Did you know co-star Ross Alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with?!  Yikes.<br /><br />Also check out the score by Erich Korngold.

 | product/productId: 0792164962 | review/userId: A25A0MJV5TXDR8 | review/summary: The movie (not the book) | review/text: I'm going to give my opinions of this movie, not the book it's based on, and I'm not going to judge the movie against the book because the movie simply isn't the book.  If everyone posting here understood this, these posts would be a lot shorter and probably less rancorous.<p>Pollack is a better director than Grisham is a writer.  The movie is better directed than the book is written.  The ending works for me.  I liked it.  I liked Cruise and Tripplehorn.  I liked the music.  I very much liked the entire supporting cast (this is one movie I'd add to a list of great ensemble movies).  Hackman gave one of his best performances, which is saying a lot.  Hunter and Strathairne were excellent (their last few lines together by the water were written and delivered perfectly).  Ed Harris was powerful.  Holbrook and Brimley were very good.  Brimley's little talk with Cruise over the photos was maybe the best scene in the movie, and his way with the simplest lines (&quot;I get paid to worry when there isn't anything to worry about,&quot; &quot;He's going nowhere,&quot; &quot;OK, Mitch?&quot;) is the mark of a pro.<p>This isn't one of my favorite movies, but it does fall into another unique category--it's one of those movies I can watch almost anytime, all the way through, and enjoy it.
 | product/productId: 6301888901 | review/userId: A2HT8T5LF487VV | review/summary: TERRIBLE BLU RAY TRANSFER! | review/text: I am only going to review the Blu Ray Disc. The picutre quality has a lot to be desired. I know part of the blame is on Renny Harlin heavy colour filters he used, like the orange or reds are to imposing at times .I couldnt help but notice the low quality tranfer which obviosuly came from a poor print.

 | product/productId: 6300248550 | review/userId: A2DSXA1E02C86D | review/summary: An overwrought melodrama not my cup of tea | review/text: JANE EYRE is the latest in a series of film adaptations of 19th century novels by female English authors that I've been encouraged to view by female acquaintances curious as to my reaction to such genteel fare. While I've thoroughly enjoyed the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK, Charlotte Bronte's JE, I'm afraid, draws a line in the sand that I cannot cross. <p>This 1983 cinematic release of JE is, as I understand it, a faithful rendering of the original written work - a claim I have no desire to verify by reading the latter. In any case, Jane (Zelah Clarke) is an orphan, raised initially by an unloving benefactress and then in a school for girls, who at 18 comes to live at Thornfield Hall, the great house of Mr. Rochester (Timothy Dalton), where Jane is employed as governess to Rochester's illegitimate daughter. Both Jane and Rochester are extremely lonely individuals, and the course of their subsequent emotional relationship is overwrought and melodramatic to an extreme. The "thorn" in Thornfield is apt, especially as it relates to the dark secret which Rochester hides in a garret room. <p>One cannot fault the quality of the production or the acting, and I'll allow three stars in recognition. Clarke is superb as the somber but independent Jane whose emotions are continuously buffeted. Dalton is perfect as the darkly handsome and brooding Rochester. The costuming seems impeccable (though I'm in no expert position to judge). And the locations of the shoot, while gloomy, are at least in England, a green and otherwise pleasant land that is my spiritual home.<p>I loved Austen's P&P, S&S and MP for the wry and sometimes mischievous humor demonstrated by those stories' respective heroines. JANE EYRE lacks any humor whatsoever. It's unrelentingly dark, gloomy and depressing. Even the scene where Jane has her fortune told by the gypsy woman is not so much a crack in the dark tenor of the storyline as another one of Rochester's manic mood swings. One wishes Rochester would just snap out of it.<p>My opinion of JE is liable to be roundly excoriated by Bronte fans. That's fine. I still wouldn't recommend it unless one is seeking to come down precipitously from an emotional high. And with a run time 1 minute short of 4 hours, the agony seems endless.
 | product/productId: 0578009927 | review/userId: A3RNYG8KJIGGPS | review/summary: Dr. Hyman does it again! | review/text: After having multiple health issues and defining some lifestyle changes that worked for me, I came across Dr. Mark Hyman on PBS a couple of years ago and purchased his program. What unfolded before my eyes was scientific explanations for the simple changes I had been making in my life (through trial and error and no help from my doctors)that had made profound positive changes in my health. I have been a real supporter of Dr. Mark Hyman's system of wellness ever since. After being allergy tested, I removed all grains (I was allergic to all of them--not to mention many other things, and yes, chocolate) and refined sugar from my diet, I lost 130 pounds. This was quite an undertaking being a pastry chef/baker and having owned a european bakery for almost 10 years. After watching Dr. Hyman's program, I finally knew why I had such success and was able to implement so many more "healthful hints" with Dr. Hyman's guidance. The positive changes that were to follow are too many to mention.  Once again, with The Ultramind Solution he absolutely hits the mark with his system on health and wellness, confirmed by scientifically proven research and functional medicine. It is about time our physicians walk with us on our health journey by not temporarily stopping symptoms but, by understanding the system of functional medicine that Dr. Mark Hyman so clearly describes in all of his literature and dvd's. I am so thankful to have stumbled across his program on PBS. He confirmed the changes I was making and added so many more that have so positively impacted my life--physically, mentally and spiritually. Knowing that all of the information is backed up by proven scientific research gave me the confidence to move forward in my ultra-wellness health journey for life. Anytime I hear anyone talking about their health in any way, I immediately tell them about Dr. Mark Hyman and his approach to wellness and give them his website www.drhyman.com. Once you experience the change, you will want to share your new found hope with everyone. I highly suggest any and all of his literature/dvd's. You will come away with an "Ultra-Awareness" for your health that is simple to implement in your daily life. I challenge you to go for it! Start "UltraLiving" today!

That it is, BUT the previews leave out profanity and offensive hand gestures the director makes the children say and do.  If I were to imitate in public what the children did in the movie, I would be arrested for public indecency and have to register as a sex offender.  And, there are adults that engage in very offensive acts.  It is porn and sadly very troubling because the children are made to engage in very blatant immoral activities.

I saw it as part of a double feature at a budget theatre and still I felt that I had been ripped off, it was that bad.  I respect Jeff Fahey's talents as an actor, but he should be ashamed to have his name attached to this piece of crap, as should Stephen King (although I guess he really had very little to with this movie's production).<br /><br />The world would be well-served if all prints of this movie could be destroyed.  Forget weapons of mass destruction --- find the original negatives for this stinker and eliminate them.  We will all be better off.
 | product/productId: 630196893X | review/userId: AHD101501WCN1 | review/summary: For the final scene alone | review/text: Others have written how this movie was a 'breakout' movie for Bogart. Others have analyzed the complex character he plays, a hardened criminal who nonetheless has a compassionate side. I found the heart- wrenching part of the movie its final scene , one of death and separation and grief presented in a truly desolating way. In my mind is the image of Ida Lupino, the little dog after the Earle- Bogart main character has been killed.<br /><br />What struck me forcibly when I watched this as a very young person was that it did not have a 'happy ending' and the thought that life might not , deeply disturbed at the time.
 | product/productId: 078062162X | review/userId: A21R3ZLSLR0W09 | review/summary: One of the most pretentious movies I have ever seen | review/text: I saw this movie for a film studies class at the university I attend.  It was absolutely horrible.  The characters are stereotypical and cliched.  The writing is shallow and at times overbearing.  The story itself arrogantly forces the audience to believe that they are viewing a "profound work." Instead, the movie does not go into the utter devastation that the town faced by losing its children, but shows the "seedy" underbelly of white suburbia.  Seems more suitable for an after school special than an award winning movie.  The only reason it got one star was because of the use of complex crosscutting and the subjunctive narrative style. That's it.  Not worth seeing, trust me.

 | product/productId: 0800142039 | review/userId: A2VLEX71IA190V | review/summary: A good movie, as long as you don't expect it to be like the book... | review/text: I'd really like to give this movie 3.5 stars because it was flawed yet I did enjoy it. The scenery and costumes were gorgeous and the movie is definitely loaded with plenty of emotion and heartfelt family moments. On top of this, the soundtrack is beautiful and entirely appropriate for the unfolding events.<br /><br />I will admit that I didn't like this movie much the first time I watched  it, and it was definitely something that grew on me. I think this is because the movie was not really an accurate depiction of the book. Other than the overly feministy nature of the movie, I also felt like some of the casting just didn't seem to be quite right. I think the character of Meg was okay because she was physically pretty and was accurately depicted as being somewhat vain (although she could have been more so), and the character of Beth was also accurately depicted as being shy and sickly, however I don't think Claire Danes was physically dainty/fragile enough for the role. As for the other two sisters, I felt like Amy was depicted very well by Kirsten and also by the other actress; she was selfish and wanted to be pampered. The character of Jo is the one I'm most unsure of. While Winona's Jo did have a temper and was a little fiesty, I felt that she could have been fiestier and more tomboy-ish. She also seemed to be a bit too reserved at times as well.<br /><br />Also, I was a little disappointed with the way character growth was portrayed in this movie; it felt rushed and sporadic, not like character growth should be. For example, Amy starts out as a selfish little girl but becomes a better person as she gets older and we see none of this transition in the movie. One day she's one way, and the next day she's a completely different person. Maybe they should have made the movie longer to do this better and maybe a longer movie would have prevented the omission of certain critical scenes in the book that were left out of the movie (like the first conversation the sisters have which really emphasizes the differences in their personalities).<br /><br />So overall, I would say this is a good movie if you don't compare or expect it to be too much like the book. Accept that it's different and you just might grow to like it like I did.

Not overly religious nor secular, gets the tone right so it can be enjoyed by everyone.

The filler between them seemed mundane. The characters were believable, for the most part - tho LeVar Buton seemed to be reading his lines, and why Katheryn Harrold was attracted to McQueen's character escaped me. The ending  was a little sappy (boy gets girl and newborn, as people cheer). We're left to wonder if his character would strive for more meaning in life as a new (unmarried)Dad.

I actually enjoyed the film because it is something of a hidden item from the 1970's overindulgence.

The effects are good but the story is great. Landing on a supposedly deserted planet only to find the sole survivor of a previous mission and his  daughter the &quot;rescuing&quot; crew begin to be killed off by an unseen  monster. There are even some real moral questions here, like should man try  to play God and create life. This is much more than just a Saturday  matinee. When you eventually see this monster remember that the animation  was done by Disney artists. If you like early sci-fi and don't have this  one, you need it.
 | product/productId: 0792846087 | review/userId: APC21B3WJDKPX | review/summary: Masterpiece | review/text: Woody Allen's wonderful sense of humor is not his greatest asset: it's his storycrafting genius, and nowhere is this more obvious than in this brilliant piece of serious drama, which is not merely an homage to Allen's  filmmaker idol Ingmar Bergman, but an emotionally complex, riveting story  in its own right. Interiors is an examination of a family coming apart at  the seams, not as a result of some outside, malevolent force, but merely  due to the intricacies of human nature.<p>Note that in his more serious  work, Allen typically paints one character as the story's conscience and  emotional center, and he usually plays this role himself; there are  disappointing results when anyone else tries to do it. Not so for Marybeth  Hurt in her multi-faceted portrayal of Joey, the family's frustrated  emotional caretaker, unable to find her own identity. Maureen Stapleton  also provides both contrast and comic relief in her role as Pearl, a  character unfettered by complexity--and intellect!<p>One of the great,  exhilirating pleasures in watching films is coming across a masterpiece  like this one.

 | product/productId: 079289877X | review/userId: A35DI28HRSEEP6 | review/summary: Well worth seeing | review/text: This is not The French Connection, but Hackman is, as always, rock solid, and the supporting cast (particularly Tommy Lee Jones) is superb.  The plot is improbable, with Russian and U.S. officers conspiring to continue the cold war and the case broken by a sergeant formerly married to a lieutenant colonel, who are basically operating independently against all of the forces that be.  Their success (guaranteed in a quintessentially American movie) reaffirms American beliefs concerning independence and integrity while it provides some action/adventure in the process.  The canvas is a little large and there are some gaffes and shaky production values, but this is a reliable way to spend a slow evening.  It's also nice to see Hackman doing a credible high crawl through rough terrain in snow.  He's the man.

This film is the weaker of the two, but it is, after all a different film. Most people, I know, have seen Funny Girl, so this could be a disappointment if one is expected the same level of film. However, it can be terrific in its own way. Barbra gets to play a modern (at the time) character with Daisy Gamble, while at the same time playing Melina Tentrees, a British gal from the past. Her acting is great, and very entertaining. While Yves Montand is not exactly a perfect leading man, he does his best. 4 and 1/2 stars.

Her screen presence also more than overcomes Josef von Sternberg's rather static direction that was typical of early sound films, elevating this romantic melodrama into its classic status.  <p>Kino's region-free DVD contains both the German and the English versions of the film, each on a separate disc.  Both versions look very clean for a 71-year-old film, although just a tad less sharp than I would have liked.  The English version looks a bit cleaner still.  The supplements include a side-by-side comparison of the two versions (with the German version shown on the left), and the English version indeed looks better.  The German version is supported by optional, white-on-black-bar English subtitles.  The black bars, of course, cover up part of the picture.  I would suggest Kino use white, black-bordered lettering for subtitles in the future instead.<p>The German version runs 102 minutes, and has a few scenes that are not shown in the English version due to censorship (such as the moment when Lola rotates her body to reveal her bare back side to her nightclub audience).  The English version runs 100 minutes.  Although it was supposedly made for English audiences, only Dietrich's role is all English-speaking, while the other actors speak a combination of both languages -- English for important dialogs, German for less important ones.  <p>The included audio commentary on the German disc is a mild disappointment.  Although historian Werner Sedendorf's analytical comments are excellent, he just does not speak often enough.  Long stretches of silence are frequent.  Kino should have thought of filling the vacancies with additional comments (either by Sedendorf or someone else), especially when a lot of relevant topics are not adequately covered, such as the legendary collaborations between Dietrich and von Sternberg, the details about the censorship practiced on the English version, the period of German Expressionism that inspired directors like von Sternberg, etc.  <p>The DVD does include a generous amount of extra material.  There is a wonderful biography section that includes photos and credits of about 30 cast and crew members.  There are about 150 photos, some of which are then-and-now comparisons of some of the props and costumes in the movie.  There are text screens of the film's production history.  The best extras, unquestionnably, are the 4 film clips of Dietrich's screen test and concert performances.  There is a memorable clip of the 1930 screen test of Dietrich singing &quot;You are the Cream in my Coffee.&quot;  There are 2 clips of televised concerts from the 60s and 70s showing Dietrich performing two of the songs in the movie (English renditions of &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; and &quot;Lola Lola&quot;).  There is another TV footage of her singing &quot;You are the Cream in my Coffee&quot; after reminiscing about her 1930 screen test.
 | product/productId: 6301782100 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: John Wayne and Gabby Hayes track the Polka Dot Bandit | review/text: &quot;Blue Steel&quot; was the fifth of the sixteen B Westerns that John Wayne made for the poverty row studio Lone Star/Monogram from 1933 to 1935.  Wayne plays U.S. Marshal  John Carruthers who shows up in town just after Danti (Yakima Canutt), the Polka Dot Bandit has robbed a safe.  While Carruthers is investigating the robbery he is seen by Sheriff Jake Withers (George Hayes before his &quot;Gabby&quot; days) and about to be arrested.  But then Carruthers saves Withers' life and they learn they are on the same side.  Carruthers then learns about Malgrove (Edward Peil), the big shot in town, who is trying to take over all of the ranches by having his gang stop all the wagons trains heading to town with supplies.  It seems there is gold under them thar hills and Malgrove wants it all.  The ranchers are about to cave in to Melgrove when the marshal and the sheriff come up with a plan to get the needed supplies to town in this above average 54-minute western.<p>Written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury, who did most of Wayne's Lone Star Westerns, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; also offers the standard passing love interest.  While all of the actors mentioned above were part of Lone Star's stock company during that period, they managed to bring in a different leading lady each time.  This time it is Elinor Hunt as Betty Mason, who apparently thinks she is in a silent movie.  She and her father (Lafe McKee) were bringing in a load of supplies when they were ambushed.  The good guys are too late to save her father, but they bring her back to town where, of course, she catches the eye of Malgrove (a nice villainous name as such things go in these films).  <p>This is an early Wayne film and he is clearly still learning his craft, but Hayes is getting a lot closer to putting all the elements of his &quot;Gabby&quot; persona into place.  Wayne actually seems more interested in having a sidekick than the girl, telling Hayes at one point: &quot;I'm glad you decided to drift along with me. It's kind of lonesome trailing alone.&quot;  It is hard to hear this and not think of how &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes would be the personification of the western sidekick in the Hopalong Cassidy movies.  Usually the attraction to these films is the stunt work by the legendary Yakima Canutt, but he sticks to his standard bag of tricks in this one.

WHY? | review/text: This version differs from the 1960 film because it contains a masturbation scene, which in my mind is a metaphor for the whole project.  Who does Gus think he is that he can mess with a classic?  Vince Vaughn reminded me more  of Lenny from &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; than Norman Bates.  There is no  reason for this film to exist.  Except one.  Thanks to modern technology,  the long zoom from the cityscape to the hotel window is now one unbroken  shot (that's worth a star).  Luckily for us it's right at the beginning of  the movie, so we can watch just that and then turn this atrocity OFF.

Different movies in almost every way, but equally superior film making. Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are sorry excuses for sequels. They're classic examples of Hollywood greed. Bad stories wrapped in excellent SFX don't make memorable movies. Alien and Aliens should be at or near the top of your &quot;Must Have&quot; sci-fi/horror/action DVD list. Aliens 3 and Alien Resurrection...well, something has to be at the bottom o' the heap.

AND a 9'-tall Leatherface who squawks and shrieks continually like he's on fire!!! There's domestic violence as foreplay, skeletal remains as home decor that works, and even an old man who just might be dead! Not to mention dialogue that begs to be belted out in song (example: "You're a bona-fide mo-ron!). Set to music, TCM:TNG could have been a well-tuned, high-performance masterwork.

Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties.

Kane at all. | review/text: If this movies underlying theme was Kanes loss of his youth and innocence symbolized by his sled, and that it affected his later behavior, then they did a terrible job conveying that on screen.<br /><br />  Kane didnt seem all that distraught by having his wealth and power. He didnt seem regretfull that he had allowed his life to lean this way. The people he interated with gave more clues to the man then Orson Welles wooden performance. All I saw was a man who wanted to do good and burned out early and yet I didnt feel none of the passion of someone of his position and abilities should have radiated on the screen.

 | product/productId: 0783241895 | review/userId: A2LKIHV5SGDY7Z | review/summary: Conan questions himself? | review/text: Great story for starters, well written with excellent performances from the cast...looks great in the wide-screen format. Some added scenes, very nice...like King Osric's daughter<br />leading Conan back to Thulsa doom for Conan to get his revenge<br />however, the last scene in the ending with Conan carrying  Osric's daughter off into the sunset seemed a bit cliche'. And the new scene in which Conan questions the last 20 years of his life, was obviously a rehersal. Not only that but, Gerry Lopez sounds like,.. Gerry Lopez in the scene and not his character, Subotai.<br />I had to laugh. Here we have Conan talking of the sweet smelling air as they prepare for Thulsa Doom's attack after stealing Doom's 'queen to be', Osric's daughter.  This film however, has something that not every movie has,.. a wonderful soundtrack!  Basil Poledouris' music could not be more fitting for the movie.  It does a most excellent job in complimenting the over all emotion and feel of such a great story. The only thing that bothered me about the soundtrack was, that it was transfered in awful 'mono', even for the dvd release.  I don't know what John Milius was thinking, obviously too wrapped up in Conan's talk of wasting the past 20 years of his life.  I still however, have to give this release a 4 star rating based upon the story and choice of cast.  Conan The Barbarian is still a great dvd to have.

Having loved music since I could remember, I was immediately drawn to this film.

 | product/productId: 6300208435 | review/userId: ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T | review/summary: Old-Time &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;; Watch Drew's Father | review/text: &quot;High School Confidential&quot; is a kind of a movie your mothers (or grandmothers) with their dates were watching (or pretending to watch) at their local driving theater.  There is no plot except that Russ Tamblyn got involved with drug in his high school, and the picture goes on showing a series of car chase, students who brandish knives, and girls who love them.  And some adults too who cannot understand their behaviors.  But, never mind, it's nothing serious.  <p>In short, the film was one of the major studios's way to cash in on the advent of recently born rock'n'roll age, and as if to prove it, it begins with nice Jerry Lee Lewis number &quot;High School Confidential.&quot;  His role?  Of course, himself.  And the cast, catching the eye of prospective audience quickly and cheaply, is the most attaractive part even now.  There is Jackie Coogan (in the original &quot;Addams Family&quot; and Chaplin's &quot;Kid&quot;) and talking of him, Charles Chaplin Jr. (!).  There is Ray Anthony from the music industry, but most interesting thing is probably  the appearance of John Drew Barrymore, real-life father of Drew Barrymore.  His name might interest some fans who knew his daughter through &quot;ET&quot; or &quot;Charlie's Angels.&quot;  <p>There is a car chase scene (in which a car overturns in a very, very ridiculous way), Mamie Van Doren (who looks like much more famous MM), and ostentatious moralistic preaching about the harm of drug.  But the formula itself survived and still we can find it in the hit movies like &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; which to some extent resembles &quot;HSC.&quot;  Nothing great, but still fun as a period piece.

 | product/productId: 5556167362 | review/userId: A1WUMTJOASEL5F | review/summary: Pete's Dragon on the rocks | review/text: They should actually invent a new party beverage called "Pete's Dragon" cause this story blooms from the pub of the main town off a rocky shore with a wonderful lighthouse. It took me awhile to warm up to this musical (what, 30 years??), and I don't mind saying I was still a skeptic. Finally I layed on my couch and gave it my full attention with no distractions, and even backtracked a little when I had to take a quick "break." I was determined to watch every frame. Bottom line, you know it's a heartwarming, YES, loveable film when the ending credits roll, and you hate to leave this place. That ending pan shot from the sky, as if riding away with Elliot made me think, I am going to miss the inside of that lighthouse. Fortunitely, I can see it again with the dvd.<br />Helen Reddy's "Candle On The Water" was nominated for best song, and it's a lovely ballad about someone who has lost a great love, and unfortunitely, is somehow waiting for his return, even in the wake of hoplessness. She sings it on the rim on top of the lighthouse at night. You know, I thought this flick was going to be another Popeye musical, which is a movie you either liked or absolutely hated. I sort of like it, but I could see why Popeye was crucified during it's day. This movie almost ventures in that direction, but manages to keep afloat in the high tide of entertainment. If you really follow the story, and relish in some of the goofiness, this movie will become heartfelt.<br />By the way, the two hammy villains remind me of Honest John and his pal Gideon of Pinocchio, and Shelly Winters looks like she's having a wonderful time playing that filthy hillbilly role of hers. Now I need a beer (and I don't drink).
 | product/productId: 6302280915 | review/userId: A37OOQQLMMKYR8 | review/summary: Decent movie mostly saved by the visual side | review/text: The Church is the 2nd feature film from director Michele Soavi who was dubbed as the savior to Italian horror. Soavi came around when Italian horror was on its last legs. With the exception of Dario Argento a lot of the other popular filmmakers were on the decline, were having trouble getting work or became knockoff directors. Michele Soavi was hailed as the savior and to be honest I never quite got why.<br /><br />Originally The Church was meant to be the 3rd part of the Demons series, but it ended up going in a different direction and what we get is a very mixed bag. The Church wasn't a bad movie, but the problem is nothing really happens.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Dario Argento, Franco Ferrini & Michele Soavi. Dardano Sacchetti, Lamberto Bava and Fabrizio Bava also contributed to the screenplay, but were un-credited. So due to that I'll just mention the credited writers.<br /><br />The screenplay actually wasn't too bad; there were some interesting concepts, while there might be a silly moment or two for the most part the script wasn't bad. The basic concept here is the same as Demons, but there was a little more depth to the screenplay. Demons and Demons 2 were fun splatter flicks, but The Church was more serious. The biggest problem here is the lack of action. The screenplay really wasn't too bad and made even better by what was coming out of Italy at this time.<br /><br />But there are some problems; the two lead characters pretty much go MIA in the 2nd half, other characters might appear early on than don't come back until the end. The 2nd half introduces some new characters and they don't add anything to the plot. They are just there to die and we don't even see most of the deaths.<br /><br />The Church does benefit from a solid cast, Giovanni Lombardo Radice has a small role and it's always great seeing him in a horror movie and a young Asia Argento also stars. The Church was Asia's 3rd movie.<br /><br />Michele Soavi worked under Dario Argento as an assistant director and it is quite clear he learned a lot. Dario Argento is a very visual filmmaker and if I didn't know any better I would think he was the director. Soavi creates a movie that is visually stunning. The Church is one of the very best shot movies I have ever seen. Dare I say it's on par with an Argento movie?<br /><br />The problem though is really nothing happens. The first few minutes are set in the medieval times and we get a little bit of action, but surprisingly little gore. After that we cut to the present and from that point on it's mostly talk and more talk. Michele Soavi is able to build some suspense and tension, but the problem is there is no pay off; though to Soavi's credit he's very much able to have a nice gothic looking horror movie.<br /><br />Like I said The Church is slow, but what saves the movie from being an all out bore is the visuals. The first half in particular is just so amazingly shot. The Church easily rates as one of the best shot horror movies I have ever seen. In the case of Italian filmmakers not all, but most have this great visual side to their movies and Michele Soavi might be one of the best. The student can't top his teacher though, but you can clearly see the Argento influence. There is some great stedi-cam work as well.<br /><br />Once we hit the 45-minute mark things begin to pick up with an excellent scene, which a character is chased around her house and I thought right there would be the turning point, but instead after that nothing really happens again. Once the hour mark comes in we have a group of characters trapped in the church and it seems like the action is about to start, but guess again.<br /><br />This is the biggest downfall to The Church the lack of action like I said we get some good moments of suspense and tension, but there is very little pay off. Despite the lack of anything happening Michele Soavi is able to create some tension and suspense thanks to his visual touch and that is what kept me interested in the movie despite the lack of action. The final act to The Church is kind of messy and more often than not the movie just sort of repeats itself by this point and the ending is very anti-climatic. If you are expecting a big showdown between the characters and demons you can forget that.<br /><br />I can't really explain why I enjoyed The Church; there is very little action, but the gore level is decent. While it might take sometime to get to the gore and when we finally get it, well it seems like a long time till we get it again, but it is done well. But not a whole lot happens. It's a lot of talk and build up with little pay off, but yet there is just something about The Church I liked. I guess it's the visual side that held my interest, but the 2nd half none of this works as well.<br /><br />In closing, The Church is a movie with a lot of potential, but just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Even though I did enjoy the movie it's not a must see and it's really the visual side that keeps things interesting, but that can only save it for so long.<br /><br />The Church sometimes goes under the title of Demons 3 along with two other movies, 1 being Lamberto Bava's The Orge and Umberto Lenzi's Black Demons. None though are sequels to Demons, but The Church is the closest one in that style.

 | product/productId: 6300183548 | review/userId: AJQKS0N35VLTK | review/summary: A follow-up to my previous review... | review/text: Having now had a chance to properly digest the offerings of the Coppola version (courtesy of the Australian DVD) I can now add to my previous review. (I'd also like to correct a mistake in my previous review: I said that the original triptych has a ratio of 3.66:1. It is in fact 3.99:1 - a further reason that a proper widescreen transfer is needed.)<br /><br />Apart from the 90+ missing minutes, the main fault is the image quality. Some of my favourite shots are ruined because of the bad quality of the film stock available for the 1980-1 version. There are stunningly beautiful shots of Napoleon being chased along the coast: the sun is burning through dark clouds right at the top of the frame, hills loom out of the mist across the sea, whilst a dark mass of land forms a black strip at the bottom of the frame, as Napoleon and his pursuers ride across the screen beneath this incredible sky. These shots are some of the worst quality in Coppola's print. Many sequences were not made from original 35mm prints - only 17.5mm elements existed. As such, the 17.5mm had to blown up to the size of 35mm, with corresponding image deterioration. This is the reason why many scenes look far worse than they do in the latest prints (many better 35mm elements were available thanks to Brownlow and others' discoveries in the early and mid 1980s, but again Coppola/Zoetrope never bothered to incorporate these into their version).<br /><br />There are also numerous examples of incorrect tinting (the original tinting and toning patterns being unclear back in 1980-1 until more discoveries of original prints in the 80s, which Coppola/Zoetrope decided to ignore, along with numerous other improvements). Another of my favourite shots is of Napoleon standing right on the edge of a rocky coastline - Gance has an incredible shot of the tiny silhouetted figure of Napoleon standing exactly in front of a setting sun behind him - the sun alone in a huge bank of cloud and Napoleon's isolated figure on top of these great rocks, the sea crashing beneath him. The scene looks much worse in this version because the tinting is a kind of pinky red, not the much more unobtrusive colour in the authentic version. The tinting here wasn't done using the traditional dye-bath methods used for the latest print by the BFI - the dye-bath gives a much subtler (and more beautiful in terms of actual colour) permeation of colour than other methods of coloration. Much of the tinting in this 1981 print seems far too vivid and often spoils some of the detail - something that dye-bath tinting and toning avoids.<br /><br />I'm also reminded just how damaging running the film at a faster speed is. As I mentioned in my last review, Coppola sped the film up to 24 fps instead of showing it at the intended/correct speed of 20 fps. As a result, all the acting and the camerawork immediately becomes distorted (the swinging camera on the pendulum rope in the double storm sequence has lost some of the incredibly hypnotic rhythm it has at normal speed). Such a basic and fundamental thing as fps speed (often a key issue in silent films as they were often shot at slower fps rates) seems elementary to showing this film properly, but even this is ignored in the Coppola version.<br /><br />Another damaging element to this version is the music - the Carmine Coppola music really is inferior to the Carl Davis score. There are hardly any moments of climax or great emotion at all. The double storm sequence loses much of its impact because of the music, as does the scene where the ghosts of the Convention appear before Napoleon and demand he carry on the Revolution. With Davis, there are incredibly sinister sliding strings and then the Marseillaise worked in to the score as the scene continues, concluding with a rousing finale. With Carmine Coppola, there is just vaguely rumbling organ music for the whole scene - no climax, no Marseillaise, no excitement. Davis also does something far more organic and complex with the classical music he uses - he works it into his own music and vice versa. For example, the Double Storm sequence uses a large amount of Beethoven's 6th, but it is subtly manipulated and expanded so that the climax is an immensely thrilling expansion of the original music and matches the images perfectly. Unlike Coppola, Davis also makes an effort to stick to historically contemporaneous music. He set himself the date of 1810, which he tried not to go beyond in terms of musical borrowing (whereas Coppola uses music by later composers like Berlioz and Mendelssohn). Carmine Coppola doesn't successfully combine his own music and historical music - there is no sense of perfect editing and organic musical melding as there is with Davis. My other main objection to Carmine Coppla's score is that it is always inferior to the images on screen - with Davis, the music remains brilliant and equal to the images for the whole of nearly 6 hours. The Davis score is thrilling, often intensely emotional, and vibrantly exciting in a way that Coppola never manages. Once you have listened to Davis' score, the Coppola simply cannot sustain your interest or emotion.<br /><br />A proper release of this film is desperately needed on DVD. The possibilities for extras are huge (not a single extra being present on any DVD release of Napoleon at present). Further missing sequences might be included - such as the two other triptych sequences no longer in the film (in any version). Gance originally had three sequences edited for the triptych widescreen (the Victims' Ball, The Double Storm, and Entry into Italy), but the first two were destroyed by Gance himself when he lost all hope of seeing his film in one piece again. The reconstructed second triptych (by all accounts an intensely thrilling example of Gance's mastery of editing and visual imagination) does apparently exist in France, but another copyright issue means it hasn't been seen anywhere else. Gance also shot some scenes in Napoleon in colour (yes, colour in 1926) and in 3D (yes, 3D in 1926), although he didn't use this footage in the final cut (although rumours persist that some of these sections still exist somewhere in France...). There is also a long-lost scene that formed part of the Toulon section, where civilians are shot by firing-squads - examples of intensely imaginative rapid cutting and camera movement. An alternative single-screen ending was also made, which includes an extra scene with the character of Tristan Fleuri not in the triptych ending.<br /><br />This film not only deserves a proper DVD release, but needs to be shown in cinemas. The effect of suddenly having a huge 60-foot wide image flood onto the screen when the triptych appears is quite simply a heart-stoppingly amazing moment - surely one of the greatest moments in all of cinema. The curtains are drawn and suddenly the Army of Italy appears spread out across the screen - words cannot do justice to this experience. That Coppola wanted to ban performances of this great work because they quite rightly refused to use his vastly inferior version and his father's music is monstrous. He would have denied the audience and future audiences this momentous experience, and that is unforgivable. The best version of Napoleon must be made available. The battle over this masterpiece is not over...
 | product/productId: 0792838416 | review/userId: A11D5TH3NT4CWG | review/summary: Great Movie, Terrible DVD | review/text: This is one of the great remakes -- a remake that actually doesn't just rehash the original. It takes the same premise in a different direction. And it has a 70s apocalyptic character -- edgy and just a little depressing. The original and this remake really reflect their times.<br /><br />So the movie is fantastic. This DVD is one of the worst I've seen (I have a few hundred DVDs). The compression is terrible -- tons of artifacts indicating severe over-compression badly done. The "letterbox" version is not true letterboxing and is also hideously bad.<br /><br />So it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. If the price is low enough, probably worth having because the film is so good.

Lamberto! | review/text: Shock (Mario Bava, 1977)<p><p>While Mario Bava put his name to Shock (known to American audiences as behind the Door II)-- the last film Bava was involved with before his death in 1980-- that probably wasn't a good move. Bava, whose career reached such heights as I, Vampiri (1956) and Bay of Blood (1971), never sank so low as this. Not even Danger: Diabolik! (1968) is this bad.<p><p>Much of the blame rests on Mario Bava's son Lamberto, who in an interview included with the DVD says (admits to?) having directed over half the film himself. Anyone who's seen any of Lamberto's solo outings (Demons 2, Demons 3, Black Sabbath,<br />Midnight Killer, etc. ad nauseam*) already knew that about five minutes into this dog. It's all the more disturbing given a high-powered, albeit small, cast and a script that might have actually worked in the hands of a director who understands how to build suspense. Mario, for example.<p><p>The story (which isn't a sequel to the original Beyond the Door, incidentally; the only thing the two have in common is David Colin, who plays a different role in each movie) centers around a family who move into a new house. Well, not really a new house. The mother, Dora (Daria Nicolodi, a Dario Argento staple), lived here before with her first husband, who committed suicide years before. Her new husband (John Steiner, who also worked with Argento in the 1982 film Tenebre)is an angel compared to the first guy, or so everyone seems to think. Dora's child from marriage #1, Marco (David Colin, who never acted in another film after this), is also along for the ride. By the family's first night in the house, Marco is starting to fall under the influence of something rather nasty.<p><p>Yes, you've seen a bunch of possessed-kid flicks before, but there's enough here to have made this one compelling (Bava has a take on the Oedipus complex that's just plain nasty-- some of the few scenes that actually make this worth watching) had it been done correctly. However, any subtlety reflected in the original script is woefully absent here; foreshadowing is writ large enough for even the densest viewer to be able to spot any good jumps from a mile off, and the ending can be seen coming long before you actually get there. Not a good thing in a supposed mystery.<p><p>Painfully, both Steiner and Nicolodi turn in good performances, and the soundtrack, originally credited to Libra (who have since been unmasked as Italian pop stalwarts Goblin), is as much a joy as is all of Goblin's other early work. However, Shock provides hard and painful evidence at how much less than the sum of its parts a whole can be. * 1/2<p>(* Yes, Lamberto is credited with the original Demons. One wonders whether Dario Argento was just the writer on that one.)

 | product/productId: 5552666526 | review/userId: A2TVMOHHS0CF0T | review/summary: Good, but not as good as the first one..... | review/text: The Home Alone movies are, and probably forever will be Christmas Classics!<br /><br />The plot of Home Alone 2 is Kevin (Maculay Culkin) becomes seperated from his family around Christmas time one again. Only this time, he's home alone....in New York City! Apparently, by some confusion at the airport Kevin boards the wrong plane, and instead of going to Miami with his family, he finds himself alone in New York.<br /><br />Now, a normal 10 year old boy would be scared, and explain to the adults working at the airport that he's borded the wrong plane, and become seperated from his family. However, Kevin is no ordinary boy, especially since he's got his Dad's personal travel bag with his Credit cards and money! To make the situation more interesting, the Wet bandits from the first Home Alone movie (Marv and Hary) have escaped from prison, and they are hiding from the police in.......New York city.<br /><br />Once you see both of these factors come into play in the movie, you know it's only a matter of time before Kevin crosses paths with Marv, and Harry. When it does, the fun and excitement commences!<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that stated this movie has a bit much violence and might not be suitable for the really young audience. I believe I was 10 years old when this movie first came out, but I never seen it at the theatre. My mother rented it, so I was probably 11 whenever I first saw the movie.<br /><br />Some good things to look for in this movie is the scenes where Kevin is running around New York. Time square, Rockerfeller center, the Plaza Hotel are just a few. The camera shots and angles of certain parts of New York were beautiful, and of course, there is one scene I'm sure that will at least "touch" everyone in some way. I'm talking about the scene where Kevin approaches the Twin Towers, and is left amazed at their size in person. Even better is the next scene where Kevin is on top of the twin towers, and is taking pictures of the view over New York city.
 | product/productId: 6301810619 | review/userId: A1U8DHSI18EEJ1 | review/summary: The Hobo Philosopher | review/text: Boy do I like this one. The executive producer (whatever that is) is Clint Eastwood. I know that Clint is a jazz fan. Well, he backed a good one here. This is a documentary film and not a music video. But there's plenty of music in it. A very nice balance, I think.<br /><br />What a story this is. The Monk was losing his mind. Something was eating his brain up. I look at this documentary like a Vincent van Gogh type story. A real tragedy. We see the whole sad story as it plays out in his life and his music right before our eyes. We see the Monk struggling at his piano as he struggles with the world around him. We meet his loving and devoted wife and son. We hear many of his contemporaries tell us about him. We follow him around to foreign countries, through dingy bus stations, in smokey night clubs and bars, recording studios and up on the concert stage.<br /><br />You want this one, believe me. This is so well done and such a great portrait. I play it over and over. I usually get it out because I want to see and hear the Monk doing his thing but every time I watch it the phenomenally tragic story hits me. What a problem for a man to have to deal with - the losing of his mind. I often wonder how much of his unusual creativity was the poor man simply adjusting to his mental deterioration - hesitating, trying to remember, selecting his next note with a wait and see attitude. Is this the one or is it this one that I want to play? What am I doing here? And then the natural genius kicks in and off he goes.<br /><br />His spinning in the subway station is haunting. His difficulty communicating with words and with his written music was something to watch. The patience of his fellow musicians and their respect for his creative gift. You had to laugh  at the struggle but yet the sadness is always there. You got to know that he knows something is disconnecting. He finally confesses to his wife, "I ain't right" or something to that effect.<br /><br />The music is always great but the story is greater. My hat is off to Bruce Ricker who put it all together. Wow! What a great movie.
 | product/productId: 6301758064 | review/userId: A2RKI7RPP5CJMG | review/summary: Completely New To Me, But Still A Great Film | review/text: I grew up in the 80's and thought that I'd seen just about all of the Christmas "classics" of that decade.  Somehow "One Magic Christmas" slipped passed me until it was packaged with "The Santa Clause/Santa Clause 2" through the Disney Movie Club.  Seeing the price for three movies as a bargain, I purchased all three.  Now I'm very familiar with the "Santa Clause" movies, but I knew absolutely nothing about this film.  When I finally sat down to watch it, it put me in a comfortable holiday mood that only a choice few Christmas films can do to me.  Mary Steenburgen headlines a solid cast of characters as Ginny Grainger.  She's a mom who's whole family is down on their luck for Christmas.  Her husband has lost his job and with it, their home.  Her boss at the supermarket hounds her despite doing everything for him and to top things off, she seems to be the only person not happy that it's Christmas time.  Enter Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), a Christmas angel sent by St. Nick to remedy the problems of Ginny Grainger.  How does he do it?  Through her Santa-believing daughter, Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois).  As the story rolls along and more terrible things and one rather traumatic event occur, Ginny loses all hope for Christmas.  Can Gideon and Abbie (with a little help from ol' Kris Kringle) save the family's Christmas.  You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />As stated before, the cast is solid.  Two standouts are Gary Basaraba as Ginny's optimistic husband and a young Elias Koteas as a family friend.  Special effects are minimal and haven't aged well, but do not distract the viewer from the story.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, Santa Claus does take on a few god-like qualities, and the "magic" at the end of the film may turn off some viewers.  However, I see this character's development and the events that occur as nothing more than another take on the Santa mythos.  A few people might also be turned off by the "creepy guy" factor of Harry Dean Stanton's Gideon.  He hangs around in trees playing a harmonica, dressed in a dark duster and a cowboy hat.  The reasons for this are explained in the film, but he does cast quite the shadow as a "friendly" stranger that may bug some parents.  Not talking to strangers should be a well developed concept for children who see this film, but it never hurts to refresh your child once in awhile.  There is also a very traumatic event that occurs near the end of the film that is dealt with very tenderly, but may be too intense for very young viewers.  Just know that it involves a shooting death of a primary character that is resolved eventually.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, there is one compilation of movie previews, a Spanish language track, and French subtitles.  That's all.  There's no extra cartoon or trivia games, so if that's your bag, you're out of luck.<br /><br />So, despite a few minor details like the creepiness of Gideon at times and what some see as the godliness of Santa, "One Magic Christmas" is a solid family film that I'm sure will be cherished by many for years to come.  Sure, it's no "A Christmas Story" or "It's A Wonderful Life," but it's still worth repeat viewings during that most wonderful time of the year.  Recommended.

It was truly eye opening to hear about the space race with equal time given to the Russian space program(not to mention excellent footage!)<p>The attention to detail is first rate! Control room and launch pad footage are mixed seamlessly with CGI simulation. The end result is a completely engrossing story with hollywood style punctuation. <p>One of the more endearing aspects is the addition of background sound to old footage. You'll be watching a clip of an observatory in the 1920s and hear things clatter or rustle at just the right moment. The sound is so subtle I didn't catch it until the 4th or 5th episode.<p>Compared to a typical series-on-DVD price... You can't afford to pass this one up.

 | product/productId: 0780619986 | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: A Great Antedote For A Rainy Day | review/text: I'm not a Mike Myers fan, and I avoided this film--and its sequels--like the plague when they were on the big screen.  But I now know the error of my ways: AUSTIN POWERS is one of the freshest bits of purely entertaining, mindless fluff to come along in quite a while, the perfect antedote to an overcast and bad-mood sort of day.<p>The story is an amalgamation of the more excessive plot ideas of such films as DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and OUR MAN FLINT.  Fashion photographer by day and swinging spy by night, Austin Powers is the toast of psychedelic London--and more than a match for Dr. Evil.  But when Dr. Evil has himself frozen, Powers does the same, and the two defrost some thirty years later and resume their battle in the much more up-tight 1990s.  The most obvious target of the spoof is the James Bond films, but fans of 1960s film will have a field day spotting the film's take offs on such characters as Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Emma Peel, celebrities like The Beatles and Andy Warhol, and such diverse films as THE TENTH VICTIM and the camp classic DR. GOLDFOOT AND THE GIRL BOMB.  And dare we mention the sixties' own classic swinging spy spoof, the infamous CASINO ROYALE?<p>Myers is greatly amusing in the double role of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, both of whom have considerable difficulty adjusting to everything from safe sex to inflation, and Elizabeth Hurley is quite good in the Diana Rigg-ish role of sidekick Vanessa Kensington.  But the real fun here is in the details--and the details include every one from Michael York to Robert Wagner to Burt Bacharach to Carrie Fisher, "Fembots" with killer pasties, and Italian sexpot Fabiana Udenio as a character with the most devastating name since Honor Blackman hit the screen in GOLDFINGER.  The soundtrack is just as swinging as it gets, with blasts of everything from "These Boots Are Made For Walking" and "I Touch Myself."  And look for a hilarious spoof of Bob Fosse-inspired choreography during the main credits!<p>You won't find any deep thoughts in AUSTIN POWERS, and thank heaven for it: giggles and grins are the order of the day, and the film delivers them in abundance.  The DVD is a nice one as well, offering your choice of widescreen or pan-and-scan, some entertaining notes and deleted scenes, and amusing commentary.  Buy it and keep on your shelf for that rainy day.

This movie did a great job in the comedy/horror genre. It has good jokes, great dark humor, and still keeps an essence of creepiness and horror elements.

 | product/productId: 1572520922 | review/userId: A3JXOXKWOIETIY | review/summary: Sixties French Magic | review/text: Most outstanding in this 1964 restored classic is the score, an outstanding '60s soundtrack by Michel Lagrand and dialogue by director Jacques Demy.  Stars Catherine Deneuve as Genevi&egrave;ve, the story is about her and her boyfriend Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) who wants to marry her, but has been drafted in the Army to fight in Algeria.<br /><br />  All elements converge to create '60s French magic as much sweet sorrow's invoked.<br /><br />  Also here is great cinematagraphy and it should be said this is not one of those schmaltzy Rogers and Hammerstein-type musicals...well just a bit of schmaltz, but the plot's got an edge, as does the style.  You don't have to be into musicals to like/love this, just into great film and music.
 | product/productId: 6302055008 | review/userId: A1ZH086GZYL5MZ | review/summary: A very violent, very gritty film... | review/text: Martin Scorcese delivers one of the best movies about organized crime ever made in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; due in large part to the intense portrayals by an excellent cast. Ray Liotta is completely believable as Henry Hill, an Irish-Italian who becomes a key player in the New York mob. He is befriended by other mob insiders -- Jimmy (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom give Oscar-caliber performances. The pace of the movie is so frenetic that you may begin to feel your pulse rise, particularly during the climactic buildup near the end. In addition to gritty performances, the groundbreaking cinematography in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; makes this a visual treat for the eyes. The only negatives are the sometimes overwhelming violence and language, which are realistically and graphically portrayed but still sometimes hard to watch. Even so, this is one of the best movies to be released in the past half-century.

When it was released on DVD in mid 2001 I bought it and watched it on a high def 32" TV with surround sound and appreciated it much more. When it was released on HD DVD I wasn't quick enough before the discs were withdrawn from sale due to faulty packaging and I was very disappointed. Needless to say I like this movie.<br />I have just watched it on Blu-ray on a 50" plasma with audio pumped out through a Yamaha amp and big speakers. The video was superb. The audio was better. It enveloped me in a seamless surround field and truly made me feel as if I was in the centre of the action.<br />If you haven't got a Blu-ray player buy one just for this movie. You won't be sorry.

While I knew it wasn't the greatest film in the world, I still enjoyed it. It was a fun film and what really made me enjoy it the most was the soundtrack. How can you not like a film that has music by one of the greatest bands of all time, Queen. From the opening theme song til the end credits Queen hammers this film home with great guitar riffs and drum beats. Yeah the special effects are somewhat cheesy and the acting isn't that great but the film is fun. Flash Gordon is not meant to be one of those films where you sit there and ask why that happened, or why does his/her outift look like that. You aren't supposed to pick apart and analyze this film. Flash Gordon is meant to be watched for fun. Sit back for an hour and a half and just lose yourself in the movie. I believe that if you watch this film and just take it for what it is, then you will enjoy it. And I look forward to a better DVD release with bonus material. This DVD is as bare bones as it gets.

Then, a week ago I began reading the book after my mom found it in a thrift store. I absolutely loved it! It has to be my all time favorite book ever, and I get bored easily with some books, especially ones that have to do with the cave man era. (I will admit that the first 20-30 pages of the book I was wondering what was going on with the clan, but I hung in there and it was WELL worth it!)<br />I bought the DVD yesterday, extremely excited to see the movie.<br />Boy, I got lost in some of the parts and I had just finished the book! I really thought the Harry Potter book to movie adaptions were bad and then I saw this. Bleck! I realize a lot of details needed to be left out (it is, after all a 500 page book) but some of the most important ones that showed the emotions and less evolved thinking of the clan that was very important shouldn't have been! One thing I noticed was that the movie spared no time in the 'rape' scenes of Daryl Hannah. C'mon, don't you think there were more important things you could have concentrated on? It wasn't even 10% of the book, but it made up for 30% of the movie. And important parts of the movie such as Ayla's first period, or even the birth of her child were all together forgotten or molested. I didn't like the movie at all- I wish they would do a mini-series or "The Stand" type movie where its 6 hours long. Who cares? Enough people love the book that they would buy it and find the time to watch it, I know I would. After watching this movie, I definatly think it is worth a do-over. And, for people who loved the movie, I'm glad for you. I just don't think it did the book justice. My boyfriend even said that if the book was anything like the movie he wasn't reading it all..How many other people had that same opinion after seeing this wretched 'masterpiece'.

This was based on the appearance of the DVD art work and was an error on my part. One night in a fit of "nothing new" to watch on  DVD I watched the film and was pleasantly surprised. I don't think the DVD jacket should have illustrated the creature as poorly as it did. In fact I think that may have hurt sales of this very good DVD.<br /><br />The story is actually not too bad, original even for King and a well made for TV movie. The DVD transfer was excellent and was filmed in exactly the right 1.85 aspect ratio to fill my large screen HDTV with a clear, crisp and colorful picture that was like a night-out at the movies.

Frank, a Jew from Brooklyn is tried under highly prejudicial circumstances. Prosecutor Hugh Dorsey (Jordan) allows condemning perjury by Jim Conley (Dutton), a black janitor who was one of the few at the factory that Saturday afternoon. Another influence is an enormous crowd outside the courthouse shouting threats against the accused through the courtroom's open windows.<br /><br />Frank, always insistent in his innocence and that every word of Conley's testimony against him is false, gets convicted and sentenced to hang. Appeals right up to the U.S. Supreme Court fail and Frank's hanging is scheduled for a few days before Gov. John Slaton (Lemmon) is due to leave office. Slaton's lifelong dream of running for the U.S. Senate is in peril if he commutes the death sentence to life, but as Slaton is Frank's last resort he feels an investigation into the trial's transcripts must be conducted.<br /><br />The more Gov. Slaton researches, the more uncertain he is that Leo Frank is guilty, yet by overturning the court's ruling, perhaps he and/or Frank may end up lynched.

Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is the story of a man who tries to connect but cannot.<p>Taxi Driver was Martin Scorsese's fourth film and I believe it to be his best, though I have an equal love for almost all of his films. He does a cameo in this and it is possibly the most memorable scene in the whole film. Paul Schrader, a great director in his own right, provides the script. Schrader started in film criticism, was fired, had no money and was forced to live on the streets. Taxi Driver is what came out of that. The score was Bernard Herman's last and it's a fine farewell to a great composer. Just like the cinematography, the music puts us inside Travis's head.<p>The film has a real dream-like quality to it and it's no doubt that that comes from its wonderful and obscure cinematography. There are shots in this film that are just astounding but there is one in particular I will never forget. Travis calls up Betsy asking for a second date and slowly the camera dollies over to the empty hallway and stays there for a minute but it feels like a lifetime. I always felt, and I hope this is right, that this symbolizes Travis's loneliness. <p>Robert De Niro gives one of the most chilling performances in film history and certainly, one of the best. Everything he does in the film is so right and I feel that it really wouldn't work if anyone else played Travis. Another Martin Scorsese regular, Harvey Keitel, turns in a surprisingly funny performance as a pimp called Sport. The scenes between these two legends are largely improvised and serve as some of the best scenes in the movie. A few of the other players are Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle and Cybil Shepard. All of these performances exceptional.<p>"You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here..."<p>One of cinema's true classics, Taxi Driver should be seen by all.

It was so romantic, sexy, exciting, sweet, man I miss the 80's and my youth! I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for the longest...just like every other fan! But in the meantime, I watch the film on Youtube! Long live the 80's and all those great love stories like Fire with Fire...Craig S. looked so fine in the movie :o)
 | product/productId: 1404973605 | review/userId: A2W4UPPE8RUT6Z | review/summary: Lacking in originality, but still good! | review/text: When I first started watching "Guess Who" all that kept running through my mind during the first several scenes was that it was too much like "Meet the Parents".  Everyone I know who saw it thought the same thing, but we all liked it nonetheless.  It was still funny, and I always like a happy ending even if it's predictable as hell!  After all, it is a remake!<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher is growing on me, as I'm not currently a huge fan of his.  He just always seems so dorky, no matter what role he is playing.  It's fitting for this movie, and I think he did well.  Bernie Mac did well in his role of the girlfriend's intimidating father!  Overall there wasn't much I didn't like about this movie.

 | product/productId: 0792841921 | review/userId: A3AYDEWU1EPF15 | review/summary: New Wave Meets Suburbia | review/text: An entertaining tale of a bored housewife in Fort Lee, New Jersey who accidentially gets mixed up in the life of a street smart drifter was one of the biggest hits in the 1980's. Not only a hit, this film marked the  major film debut of a then rising star named Madonna, and made here a  household name throughout the world.<p>The movie which takes place in New  York City circa 1985 revolves around Roberta (Arquette), a disenchanted  housewife who is married to the hot tub king of New Jersey. Due to the  great amount of free time in her life, Roberta reads the classifieds to  follow the movements of Susan (Madonna) who happens to be in the city  awaiting the arrival of her boyfriend and his band.<p>The movie which  revolves around a theme of amnesia and a museum heist was an excellent  starring for Madonna. Although the film was originally a starring vehicle  for Arquette and Aidan Quinn, it was Madonna who stoled the film from the  very start. Madonna-mania was sweeping the country at the time, and almost  every teenage girl wanted to look and act like her. <p>Madonna ,who won the  role after using smart marketing methods (the producers wanted to cast  Ellen Barkin in the role), gave the film many wonderful touches due to her  punk look (dirty blond hair, plastic bracelets, lace gloves) and gave me  many memories of growing up in New York during the mid-1980's. To further  compliment the film, Madonna's hit single at the time &quot;Into the  Groove,&quot; became the film's anthem, and even today, the song still  sounds as good as it did then.<p>Director Susan Siedelman (&quot;She  Devil&quot;; &quot;Cookie&quot;; &quot;Sex &amp; the City&quot;) does an  excellent job of weaving both script and characters together. Overall this  film will appeal to anyone who lived in the Metro New York area during the  1980's, as well as anyone who enjoys the New Wave style of that decade.  <p>The DVD features are great and I was happy to see the original ending  that was cut out of the film. It was great to see this, and only the great  technology of DVD gives consumers many benefits that VHS doesn't. It was  great to see the film's theatrical trailer as well, because trailers then  look so poorly produced in comparison to the ones today. <p>If you are  looking for a modern day classic, then this is the film for you. A true  classic in '80's cinema.
 | product/productId: 0784010528 | review/userId: AB8MSE5JHEG97 | review/summary: "Motel Money Murder Madness..." | review/text: This is Oliver Stone's best film, Val Kilmer's best performance, and the 2d best fiction film representation of a rock band (This Is Spinal Tap is the best, of course). But first, the bad news:<br />Stone's miscogyny nearly sinks the film. Morrison's significant other,Pamela Courson, was by all accounts, a tough as nails hippy chick who had the measure of her man. Jim was as devoted to her as he could be to a woman, and while both strayed often, they always came back to each other. Doors songs memorializing their relationship, like "Queen of the Highway," are a window into what Ray Manzarek termed a great love story. In the film, poor Meg Ryan (an excellent physical match for Pam) plays her as a nagging whiny scold, always trying to stop our hero from doing whatever it is a man's gotta do. Nothing could have been further from the truth, as Pam's refusal to put Jim on a leash was what kept them together. Her character is intolerable in the flick, just like Sissy Spacek's performance as Jim Garrison's wife in JFK and Daryl Hannah's in Wall Street, and is likely more representative of Stone's relationships with sundry long-suffering ex-wives than Pam and Jim.  Stone's miscogny rears its ugly head again in his slander of Nico, the ethereal, brilliant ice goddess, here depicted as a balloon-breasted nekkid bimbo. Ugh.<br />These 2 dead women are sadly not around to kick Stone's butt for the injustice committed herein.<br />Second: for a movie called "The Doors," Robby Krieger, John Densmore, and Ray Manzarek are relegated to the background of the film. Morrison deferred to them in all matters artistic, and in return they provided him with a splendid musical carpet, backing his every unpredictable move every step of the way. While the film does justice to the music, it barely acknowledges the contribution of the musicians, without whom Morrison knew and acknowledged he was nothing. Character-wise, they seem like low-key versions of Pam, bemused and upset by Jim's antics where I suspect in real life they were enablers and facilitors and collaborators.<br /><br />Now the good: perhaps because and not in spite of the fact Stone was stuck in the jungles of Vietnam while this story was being played out, as an imaginative re-creation of The Summer of Love and its dark aftermath, this film is nonpareil. Every detail of decor and costume, every location, seems dead-on accurate. [except for the fact that the women who pack the gigs look like they just tumbled off a casting couch...] I think Stone relished making up for the '60's he missed, and threw himself into the project with discipline and love. (Think of this as the homefront story playing out behind Platoon and Born on the 4th of July...)The concert scenes are phenomenal, orchestrated chaos spiraling out of control, while the ring-leader looks on with a bemused, ironic detatchment, not quite knowing what to make of the mindless Dionysian energies he has un-leashed in his audience.<br />Morrison speaks to Stone: both are products of the counterculture gestalt, both are artists who mix vast talent with vast pretension, excess, bombast, a boatload of drugs, and macho nonsense in equal measure. Stone's aesthetic failings are also Morrison's (great pop star/wretched poet), so the weaknesses of the film don't really hurt the movie, they make it seem more true to Mr Mojo Risin's messed up genius.<br />Finally -- Val Kilmer. This performance/incarnation is flat-out uncanny. Beyond capturing the obvious -- the looks, the voice, the stance, the charisma -- Kilmer also catches the irony and anti-star compulsions; his bemused role-playing when he poses for cheesecake photos for the cover of 16 magazine, his desire to shake up his audience by all the means at his disposal, his willful physical degeneration, pulling the plug on his Pop Star persona by turning himself into a tubby bearded wino/bluesman in record time. Kilmer never lets us forget Morrison was something of a clown, waiting and watching to see what would happen next when he ventured out further on the edge, appreciating the absurdity of the endeavor. Kilmer's sense of humor and self-mockery is what saves the movie from pretension, as it ultimately saves Morrison's art.<br /><br />Formally, this movie initiated the chaotic visual style, expressionist psychedelic agit-prop, which Stone brought to fruition in subsequent films like JFK, Natural Born Killers, and Nixon. The film seems to careen out of control, but Stone's hand is firmly on the tiller. By the time we get to the legendary Miami concert that basically ended the band's career, with Kilmer/Morrison exhorting his equally whacked-out audience to follow him all the way, but clueless as to the destination, the swirling disembodied camera, perfectly re-created music, and wild montage really puts us in the heart of an epoch long past -- I really felt like i was there. Warts and all, a classic.

Filmed in 3-D, a feat in itself for fifty years ago, this tale revolves around Price, a wax museum curator, who is badly disfigured in a fire set by his greedy partner (the effable Roy Roberts) in order to get the twenty five thousand dollars in insurance money.  A few years later, a now demented Price wants revenge and gets it, while setting up a fanciful new wax museum whose figures have a secret twist.  We all know how they're made, but it's fun guessing along.  Carolyn Jones (Addams Family), Phyllis Kirk, Frank Lovejoy and Charles Bronson all show up in supporting roles and the end result is a campy, enjoyable thriller, actually much more interesting than the confusing 2005 remake.  Price fans will love this one.

 | product/productId: 0882709771 | review/userId: A1E12CWVAJYDM2 | review/summary: what a powerhouse for the Lord | review/text: None other was like this saint. I never met her but wish I had, she was always going up against everything thrown at her with grace, poise and her tremendous faith. I knew several that had gone to her healings services and were touched dramatically-their healings stuck and prove she was no hoax. In my youth I listened to her on the radio. Viewing the DVD was awesome. It is reflective of the time it was published, but just getting to see her do what she was known for, thrills my heart everytime I watch it. She wasn't "received" for being a woman doing what the church thought was designated male territory. But it didn't stop her. She loved everyone, it didn't matter what your background, she wanted you to meet the Master, and she was determined to help you get there. I chuckled at the opening statement...when asked why Las Vegas, she said human nature is the same in every city. Well put! She was the apple of the Savior's eye, she did what she set out to do, which was lift up the name of Jesus and get His kids back to serving Him, and always giving the Glory to the Father. The DVD captures her doing what she always did. And she was so genuine and real. I enjoy her energy and enthusiam!

 | product/productId: 0767819586 | review/userId: A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH | review/summary: Jolie's best performance to date...and Ryders last | review/text: I watched this film again last night with my wife (her first time) and upon the second go through I appreciated the film for much more than I felt the first go through.  I will openly admit that the first watching was for a glimpse Jolie's beauty, and her role in this film somehwat prohibits that.  Watching for the second time, this time around for the pure acting and or story line and theres much more to report.  If ever an actress deserved an award more than Jolie here please let me know.  She NAILED her performance in everyway, outshining Ryder by a long shot and proving that she is by far one of the most talented leading ladies around.  Lisa (Jolie's charactor) is the most interesting person on screen, her soul is captured by Jolie's passion for her art here and you feel attached to her, just as Susanna (Ryder) is throughout this film...The film is actually someone mellow-dramatic when Jolie is not around.  This film has an air of sadness about it as you see these girls and how their lives are destroyed by their illnesses...a young girl with burn scares almost brought me to tears when she's crying and screaming about being ugly...and when Ryder and Jolie sing her to sleep...it's heart breaking...as is one of the final scenes when Ryder confronts Jolie with her true feelings.  This is a great film that shouldn't be missed, and is full of great performances by actresses that don't deliver normally like Brittney Murphy who soars in her performance here.  A note, kinda humourous actually, but in the beginning when Ryder is talking she asks if you've ever stolen something when you had the money...HA, she did!!!!

The west was a hard and horrible place or so this movie shows us.  Duall and Jones take a herd of cows, horses, green cowboys and two pigs from Texas to Montana where they encounter some rather rough characters, Indians, old lovers and life long enemies.  I loved this movie, loved how the characters would come and go and how the storylines built on themselves and then twisted back to the beginning to tell the whole story.  Great Movie.
 | product/productId: 6300268047 | review/userId: AKZ0VCSGG1YIS | review/summary: Unbelievably bad! | review/text: This movie is trash from one end to the other- no matter whether you believe Oswald did it or not.<br /><br />The production values are terrible, the dialoge is borderline idiotic, and one small problem, the "reason" given for the whole operation is stupid and vague.  In addition, NOBODY questions anything.<br /><br />Obstacles to the successful completion of the assassination (as shown in the movie) are either ignored or glossed over without comment.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the whole movie is when Will Geer's character seems to have second thoughts about the operation and inquires if there isn't anything that Kennedy has done that could be used to blackmail him (or words to that effect.)<br /><br />Burt Lancaster chuckles and tells Geer that they are "way ahead of him," and they could find nothing.<br /><br />They must have employed the Mr. Magoo private detective agency.<br /><br />Look for the overhead microphones bobbing in many of the shots and the kid throwing papers on the morning of the assassination wearing a Texas Rangers baseball cap- the Rangers didn't move to the DFW area until 1972.  This is not to mention the famous "wanted for treason" handbill that was seen in Dallas before the assassination WRAPPED around the paper.<br /><br />The final insult is the BS about the actuary who determined that the odds of witnesses being dead by a certain date were about a Google-plex to one.  It was found that the person did the calculations incorrectly and the odds were much lower.
 | product/productId: 6301640667 | review/userId: A3MV1KKHX51FYT | review/summary: The Great Suspense Thriller | review/text: "The events in this film are fiction" says the opening. This film is dedicated to the foreign correspondents who report the news. The publisher of the 'NY Globe' wants to send a crime reporter, Johnny Jones, to report on Europe with a fresh outlook. He is to interview Van Meer on the situation in Europe. There are some comic scenes. People arrive for the meeting in London. Mr. Steven Fisher says Van Meer can't attend as planned. Jones goes to Holland for the Peace Conference with Van Meer. But a "lone gunman" shoots Van Meer and makes his escape. He is chased through the flat countryside - then disappears! A wind blows Jones' hat off, and this accident draws his attention to a mill whose sails turn against the wind. Jones finds the real Van Meer hidden away, a double was used to provide a patsy! There is plenty of suspense in these scenes. The gang clears out before Jones returns with the police.<br /><br />Back at the hotel two men attempt to abduct Jones, but he escapes. Another ruse allows him to retrieve his clothes and then board a ship to London. Jones finds Mr. Fisher meeting Mr. Krug! There is double dealing here, a conspiracy. Rowley the bodyguard will take care of Jones. But there is a hitch in the plan. Mr. ffoliot is up on things and has a plan to get Van Meer (no doubt about his work for MI5). But his plan fails due to another human error. Van Meer knows a secret that the spies want. Torture gets the secret from Van Meer. Fisher and his daughter will travel to America on a Clipper flying boat. A ship at sea begins to shell their Clipper [which flies higher and faster], this forces the plane to crash into the sea. The survivors use the wing as a raft. After rescue Jones reports the air raid in London and warns America to become prepared for the future.<br /><br />This fast-paced thriller set a high level that would not be equaled by later films. It combined political intrigue with the usual Hitchcock formula of the chase of an innocent man and a girl, and their eventual vindication. Some events are dated now, but were quite innovative then. How many other films repeated these scenes? The raft at sea foretells "Lifeboat", the chase "Saboteur" or "North by Northwest", the impersonation recalls "The Lady Vanishes" (or the novel "The 39 Steps"), the unmasking of an important person as a villain "North by Northwest". Is there irony in having Johnny Jones use a pseudonym?

I just wonder where I'm supposed to find the "Alternate Ending", as opposed to it being shown on TV once, or so I've heard. I like the crisp, crystal clear sound quality I recieved from Blu Ray on this movie, but with no extras, i condemn Universal for making such an unnecessary move. If you are looking for the thrill and re-digitizing aspect of good horror sci-fi making, then this is for you. However, if you have the Collector's Edition, and you plan to purchase the Blu-Ray edition, I strongly recommend that you keep the Collector's if you want those fun extras.
 | product/productId: 0783244320 | review/userId: ARAM6WHIU854L | review/summary: wonderful parody | review/text: I purchased a copy for our kids, hoping it wouldn't be too silly, or politically correct.  Granted, I don't expect much from the cultural morass that eminates from Hollywood, but &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is a gem.  My favorable opinion may be influenced by long familiarity with the movie's alter ego &quot;Star Trek&quot; (and its conventions), on which GQ is obviously based -- although don't tell Paramount's executives that.  You don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy it, but it doesn't hurt.  (However, the cute drydock departure is designed to appeal to those who remember ST-TMP.)  The technobabel, e.g., &quot;beryllium balls&quot; (in lieu of &quot;dilithium crystals&quot;), was delightful.  (It also gave me the excuse to pull out a periodical table for the kids.  I pointed out that the GQ crew should have washed their hands after retrieving the ball since that metal is toxic.)  Unlike so many sci-fi films in which a feeble or incoherent plot is plastered by gee-whiz optics (&quot;Lost in Space&quot; and the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies come to mind), GQ has a nicely arranged theme (much like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) in which, once disbelief is suspended on physical premises, the story proceeds without being disrupted by internal contradictions or leftist sermonizing.  GQ is humorous without being needlessly slapstick, and although (or maybe because) it's deliberately camp, the plot holds together quite nicely.  The acting is also very appropriate for the story.  The effects are credible, but don't overwhelm the characters or the story.  Real nice job.

The digital transfer to DVD is awful; the "FOG" is nothing but Pixels. As for being a frightening, creepy or even slightly scary film it falls on its face. There is nothing at all thrilling about this boring remake. Its disappointing that this cast was given such a vehicle of banality to act in, we all have seen these people shine in other roles. The Original, as many have pointed out before, is dripping in creepiness and still to this day resonates in my mind every time I am passed by a wisp of fog.  What Hollywood fails to realize with all these thinned out remakes is that the original films were rooted in the times, the mood of society, the innocence of this country and the untapped talents of up and coming directors and writers who have since become jaded and bored.

Then, we see the car almost white with smoke and the two guys so stoned they don't realize they are parked. That, and a couple of other scenes were funny but overall it's predictable in the negative aspects: language (Strother Martin) , gratuitous sex and and the general irreverence of the 1960s and '70s "counterculture."<br /><br />And...oh, yeah, the two boys finish every sentence with the word "man." Well, all I can say is the film had it's day, man, but is a bit dated by now, man! (But still funny!)

 | product/productId: 1559408871 | review/userId: A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ | review/summary: JER  AND  ME | review/text: For the majority of us, we appreciate two kinds of beauty : the beauty of a face or of a body and the beauty of a mind that some call the moral beauty. For canadian director David Cronenberg, there is a third kind of  beauty : the beauty inside. When I say inside, I mean REALLY inside, that  is the hidden parts of your body, your viscera for instance.<p>This theme  is a constant in David Cronenberg's filmography and you have to accept it  if you want to discover this director. In DEAD RINGERS, Cronenberg  associates this theme to another disturbing subject : the twins. And the  result is one of the strangest movie of the eighties : DEAD RINGERS. The  movie is going to arouse a lot of debates in front of your television set  because it doesn't let anyone indifferent. <p>The thematic of the Double is  here widely explorated by an inspired Cronenberg who will drive you once  again in a labyrinthic world of metallic buildings and cold hospitals. No  street scenes to be expected here. At the end of the movie, you still won't  know why, in the case of twins, when you cut them in half, the result is  two and not four.<p>A perfect copy from Criterion with very interesting  extras such as a Cronenberg commentary and a museum of the strange medical  instruments invented by the brothers.<p>A DVD for your library.
 | product/productId: 6300274195 | review/userId: A2QRB6L1MCJ53G | review/summary: Best Disney film of all time | review/text: I grew up watching just about all of the Disney movies that have ever came out and now I'm 19 and can't wait for my kids to watch all the Disney films I still have, especially &quot;Dumbo.&quot;  I have one question, how can  anybody not give &quot;Dumbo&quot; a perfect 5 stars?  It defines classic  in more ways than just about any other Disney film.  It tells the classic  story of friendship between Dumbo and Timothy the mouse.  Dumbo eventually  ends up back with his mom at the end of the movie.  <p>I could write a  review on just about every Disney film that's ever been made, but Dumbo is  the only one that I really like enough even now that I'm grown, to write a  review of.  It has some of the best classic songs and sounds from any of  the Disney films and my favorite part of the movie is when Dumbo and the  mouse get drunk and see all the pink elephants.  &quot;Dumbo&quot; is what  I would call a true classic in every way.
 | product/productId: 6301662954 | review/userId: A301Q50PUIVXG8 | review/summary: the best way to understand DEs | review/text: When I want to understand my father's part on a Destroyer Escort in the Pacific in WWII, I can look at faded photos in a crumbling album, or read accounts of sea battles, but it all seems so incredibly far away and unreal. I am so grateful that Hollywood took the time and care in 1957 to make this movie about the battle of a DE and a U-Boat, filmed in large measure at sea on an actual DE. I can see  how the decks gleamed in the sunlight, hear the sounds of a General Alarm and of men racing to battle stations, see depth charges, 20 MM and 3" guns, "hedgehogs", sonar and radar sweeps, compasses, officers' quarters and enlisted men's cots stacked three high.<br /><br />  In the original book the DE was British, and the ending considerably sadder than in this movie made 12 years after WWII, but the movie is remarkably free of sentimentality none the less. I am so glad it was made. See it.

 | product/productId: 6301661745 | review/userId: A1PMGAZM7ND4LG | review/summary: Such an Ape experience! | review/text: I have to say that this set is one of the best investments I have ever made.<br />The original saga of Planet of the Apes is definitely a cult for the fans, so precisely for those fans there is absolutely NOTHING better you can get, and believe me, every penny is worth it, not to mention that the price is really low for its value taking in consideration that we are talking about 5 movies here and the most complete collection of extra features publised up to date, including the Documentary "Behind The Planet Of The Apes'. The only improvement opportunity is that this documentary should have offered subtitles as it did in the DVD release.<br />Now, if you will judge the produtc by image/sound quality, take in consideration that the original films are between 39 and 44 years old, so the restoration jobs done here are a great achievement by themselves.  This is being offered to the public in the highest definition and quality in image and sound available to the open market today, so I can say with no fear that this is the best anyone can get these days for these wonderful pieces of the seventh art.<br />I am not even going to talk about the production and performances of the movies because that is already settled and mentioned before: PIECES OF ART!!!.<br />Last but not least, the package is awesome and it includes the easiest to follow timeline ever published on this wonderful story plus photographic material that takes anyone's breath.

 | product/productId: 6300213811 | review/userId: AS1KQ8H27S80Z | review/summary: Prophecy: The PSEUDO-SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS Monster Movie | review/text: John Frankenheimer has primarily made movies in the Drama, Espionage, Political Paranoia, Historical Study, and Action genres.  &quot;Prophecy&quot; is Frankenheimer's one bona fide horror movie and is sadly among the director's most forgettable films.<p>Accompanied by his pregnant musician wife(Talia Shire), a dedicated inner-city doctor(Robert Foxworth) travels to the American Indian-populated forests of Maine in order to study environmental conditions.  Foxworth and Shire discover a giant killer bear-creature that was spawned by the waste from a nearby paper factory.<p>&quot;Prophecy&quot; is one of John Frankenheimer's more inferior pictures.  The film came out a few years after the release of &quot;Black Sunday,&quot; Frankenheimer's last great movie.  Frankenheimer and screenwriter David Selzter apparently wanted &quot;Prophecy&quot; to be a socially conscious thriller.  Seltzer interweaves intense political issues such as abortion, Native American rights, urban poverty, and, in particular, environmental pollution, into the story.  In the end, the picture simply becomes another forgettable horror film that harks back to the low-budget monster movies of the 1950s.  Some of the dialogue between the characters sounds unrealistic.  A number of the death scenes are more hilarious than frightening.  The music is completely out-of-place in some parts of the film.<p>&quot;Prophecy&quot; is not entirely without merit.  Some parts of the movie are very suspenseful.  The acting is fairly good for a film of this genre.  Shire does her best with the inferior script.  Armand Assante also gives a fine performance as an American Indian who is fighting the business corporations that are moving into the Maine forests.<p>&quot;Prophecy&quot; is nothing more than a forgettable time killer.

My pleasure in this movie was almost sapped by an American Studies Professor assigning a class in the American Horror Film to read her  study: Jaws as Patriarchal Myth.<p>I just wanted to take this opportunity  to share some Jaws trivia:<p>&gt; Jaws was the first summer blockbuster,  the first summer movie released as an event (same-day national release with  saturation advertising).<p>&gt; &quot;Bruce&quot; the mechanical shark used  in the film worked so poorly Spielberg was forced to shoot around it.  By  doing so he delayed the appearance of the shark until so far into the movie  that there was unintended suspense.  Any viewer will tell you that suspense  makes the movie work very well.  This creative improvisation on Spielberg's  part is evidence of his strong, strong talent.<p>&gt; Robert Shaw's story  of the Indianapolis is true.<p>I recommend making a viewing of Jaws a  Spring tradition, also Bull Durham.  Good ways to get into the summer  spirit.

 | product/productId: 0783226713 | review/userId: A17FLA8HQOFVIG | review/summary: A bit old fashioned, but true to the classic story | review/text: As this version of the classic Dickens' novel was filmed in 1934, it doesn't have the special effects we modern audiences are used to, but the story rings true.  The acting was good and so was the casting.  Philips Holmes, in the role of Pip as a young gentleman, was 27 at the time and Jane Wyatt, best remembered for her later role in the TV series "Father Knows Best", cast as Estella, was only 23 and full of youthful fervor.  Francis Sullivan played Jaggers, a role so meant for him that he played it again in the 1947 version of the film.  I loved the performance of Florence Reed as Miss Havisham although the garish makeup she wore when we first meet her was a bit startling.  And Henry Hull, as Magwich was an excellent convict.<p>We must remember that, in 1934, talkies were still new and so there is a musical score that seems overdone and old fashioned by today's standards.  But it follows the action, adding tension where necessary.  Also, I sometimes felt that the actors' performances seemed to be more geared to the stage than the movies.  I enjoyed the film completely, however, and especially liked contrasting it to the other versions I've seen.  The 1947 one was good too, but somehow I liked this the best.  And the less said the better about the awful 1998 one in which the story was so changed that it was unrecognizable from Dickens' original intention. The story and the film is a classic and I recommend this version.

 | product/productId: 0792837622 | review/userId: AAOT8ZNO94H0V | review/summary: THE Musical, As It Should Be Presented | review/text: "West Side Story" is proof that the sum of its parts can not only be greater than the whole, but possibly be the greatest!<br /><br />Little known writer in Elizabethian England pens a drama about two star-crossed lovers. Flash ahead to the turbulent streets of New York in the late 1950s and early 60s. Turn feuding families to rival gangs. Add music, choreography, make it vital. Then find a brilliant director who knows what to show, and watch as it takes home every Oscar it can.<br /><br />We know the story of this film but what's important for you to know about here are the extras you get in this package that make it worth your while: The first disc is the film, preserved perfectly. And the second disc has your special features.<br /><br />First, you get a great documentary on the making of the film. Titled "West Side Memories," Principals like Sondheim, Moreno, Chakiris, Beymer and more sit before the cameras and explain the process of preparing and executing what could be the finest example of the Hollywood Musical, ever. It's a piece that's could have been a stand alone DVD, it's so rich with insights.<br /><br />You also get an interesting "Storyboard to Film" montage, where you see the artist's renderings of the scenes, and how those shots looked when they appeared in the film. You get to study these storyboards more carefully in several galleries on the disc. Lots of other goodies, like the theatrical trailers and photos galore... everything from Jerome Robbins's cattle call for dancers to location shots during production!<br /><br />And if that wasn't enough, there's a massive book that comes with the set, that includes the complete script of the film, the original lobby brouchure that theater patrons who attended the film received, which has more photos and info, and the newspaper clippings lauding the film as it took its place in movie musical legend.<br /><br />It's simply a valentine to a remarkable film, and a fantastic package, all the way around.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 078881107X | review/userId: A1SJ8UV87JFCUO | review/summary: Good but different from the original movie. | review/text: KiKi's delivery service is one of my favorite films but this edition of the movie is different from the original. If anyone has seen the older copy of the movie, you will realize a few changes. One, half of Jiji's dialogue has been cut and i was very disappointed with that. The original dialogue really brought Jiji's character to life. Two, the soundtrack is different as well. In the original when kiki was first flying away from home the song was in english called "Soaring" (look it up on Youtube it's a really good song). They changed all the english songs to japanese. Third, a lot of the back round track for other animals, and objects are gone too. Overall if you can find an older copy of the movie then buy that one. Not the new edition.
 | product/productId: 6301796535 | review/userId: A39CX0EE4BZCZC | review/summary: Only In The Movies | review/text: This was the ultimate example of Hollywood glorifying prostitutes and showing them to be gorgeous (and basically good-hearted) women. I do NOT speak from experience but from number of real-life cop-friends I can tell you this: you average hooker looks the OPPOSITE of Julia Roberts (or Melanie Griffth or Elizabeth Shue and all the rest of the hooker-hotties Hollywood throws at us.)<br /><br />However, it is still a fun movie which has entertained most people who have watched it for over 20 years. Roberts and Richard Gere certainly make a handsome couple (and still do). Hector Elizondo almost steals the show with his minor role as "Barney," the hotel manager. He is definitely the most humorous character in the film.<br /><br />It's a funny, charming and romantic film that was a big hit. Just don't believe it when Hollywood continues to glamorize the seedy aspects of prostitution.

Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn play two elderly people who go up to there cottage on Golden Pond to spend a summer. over the course of that trip, they befriend a lonely boy, evaluate there lives, and forge a relationship with there daughter (Jane Fonda). all the performers are great but the two standouts are Fonda and Hepburn. each one plays a foil to another, Fonda as Norman, is a crochity, wise cracking, disputible old man whil Hepburn as Ethel is a gentle, loving, all around caring person who acts as the peacemaker. when there both on screen, they are dynamite and both richley deserved those oscars. also, when both Fonda's are on screen they each show that no mater what they both love each other. a truley great film that will just leave you feeling great, On Golden Pond is recomended for anyone who loves movies.
 | product/productId: 078062789X | review/userId: A31U2QT7SAL7K | review/summary: More money shoulda been spent on the script!!! | review/text: I knew "The Outer Limits," and this, "Virginia", ain't no "Outer Limits".<br /><br />Two astronauts lose two minutes during a routine space walk and we, the viewers, must endure one hundred and nine minutes of pure movie-watching HELL.<br /><br />It's not that the stars aren't doing the best with what they've got.  Depp makes an effective is-he-or-isn't-he husband of Charlize Theron, appropriately unnerved by the creepy goings on around her.  Sadly, the duo is saddled with a less-than-thrilling script and an inexperienced director.<br /><br />While it's great to see character actors Blair Brown, Donna Murphy, and Joe Morton, they, too, are wasted.  Brown, an actress whose film career hasn't grown like her weight, has very little to do as the wife of Depp's new employer.  Murphy, a well-respected stage actress, has about as much screen time here as she did in last summer's blockbuster, "Spiderman 2."<br /><br />Morton is basically playing the same character, though slightly unhinged, that he played in "Terminator 2"...or was it on TV's Smallville,"...or was it "What Lies Beneath"?  Either way, he doesn't have to stretch his acting chops on this one.<br /><br />This is one time when the appetizer (the trailer) is more filling than the main entree (the film, itself).

A nice, quick sci-fi b-movie with some good action, decent f/x and some subpar acting(of course).  Great villian in Ron Silver and Van Damme tries but the film could have been upped a notch with a better lead.  Some lapses in logic but are forgivable due to the fact that no one knows what kind of results would be reaped when playing with time.  All and all a fun adventure if looking for a quick flick.

Who else but she could have gone through so many costume changes and looked as good in each one? Who else at the time had the range and experience, as well as beauty, to tackle the role?<p>Richard Burton had just the right fire and flair to pull off the role of Marc Antony. It didn't hurt, either, that he was infatuated by his co-star.<p>Rex Harrison utilized his commanding presence to his advantage in the somewhat third-tier part of Julius Caesar. Although he appears roughly in the first half of the film, he still is memorable in his part.<p>Hume Cronyn, Cesare Donova, and the great Roddy McDowall are brilliant in their supporting roles. Future &quot;Archie Bunker&quot; Carroll O'Conner and Academy-award winner Martin Landau are also on board in significant parts. Veteran character actor John Hoyt, always effective, portrays a Roman senator.<p>Alex North's score is one of his best. Too bad that it is not in circulation at present.<p>Now, I would be extremely satisfied if Twentieth Century Fox could find those reported missing two hours of film. <p>Would love to see how the whole bloody pleasure would have looked at six hours long!
 | product/productId: 6300270998 | review/userId: ADS5APY1NKTL4 | review/summary: beautiful and powerful film...... | review/text: THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA recounts the experience of three young Portuguese children who saw the vistion of Our Lady of Fatima, while playing in the cova (meadowland) in a cloud of light in the sky.  This was during the height of World War II, when the government was extremely repressive and anti-religious.  Priests seen wearing their religious garments in public were arrested and charged as criminals.  Lucia (Susan Whitney), one of the children, was told by the Lady of Fatima to come again to the cova and to be a vessel for her message.  However, Hugo (Gilbert Roland), an agnostic adult friend of the children, tells them to be quiet about their experience, so as to stay safe from the extreme laws (that could include torture of anyone who challenges the government's decree).<br /><br />The strength of the story lies in its quiet power to give validity, dignity and respect to the children's experience, without being preachy.  It is truly a remarkable story worth seeing to believe.
 | product/productId: 0792835085 | review/userId: A3RX6E9EP1J5WW | review/summary: A Message from 1973...Terrific Entertainment | review/text: I recently pulled out my copy of this movie for a re-watch and was reminded all over again how well some movies age. This is one of those. While it is a Michael Crichton story, and most books don't do well being transitioned to film, this one did. Pared down, yet maintaining the tension and smoothing out the edges too much dialogue would create, this is one of the best transitions I've seen.<br /><br />Westworld, Roman World and Medieval World make up the segments of a new type of grown up Disneyland called Delos. The story revolves around what happens in Delos when a glitch (modern day folks will recognize it as a computer virus) wreaks havoc on this machine driven utopia for humans. Our two main characters, wonderfully portrayed by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, have chosen to visit Westworld for a good old fashioned gun-slinging adventure. One of them is fully immersed while the other still feels rather odd shooting people or having random sex even if they are robots. They look and act human within the context of their programming. They get a whole lot more gunslinging than they bargained for during this very bad vacation.<br /><br />Yul Brynner, our main foe, is not singing about Siam in this movie either...he's a robot gunslinger and a bad dude. And he is also infected with the virus that makes them react aggressively against the humans who blissfully vacation there. He is stunning in this movie. For a robot that displays no emotion he does an excellent job of using microexpressions and posture to create a fully realized menacing enemy that never tires or sleeps.<br /><br />The virus or glitch that ruins Delos isn't limited to West World and though the movie doesn't focus on it too extensively, the mayhem in Roman World and Medieval World is just as horrifying and the results very deadly. There are secondary characters that we intermittently follow in those other worlds that allow the watcher to see what happens, if briefly.<br /><br />Now, I love a movie with a morality tale behind it and this one is chock full of them. It's also quite prescient in many respects. Today, almost 40 years after it was made, we are nearly immune to the pain of others. We are entertained by reality TV where people are in danger or deprived. We watch stand-offs on TV, eyes peeled for the shoot out or dramatic suicide (as just happened the other day on FOX). We watch endless replays of bombings and grainy footage of horrific happenings (like the man who ate the person's face recently). We are entertained by the horrible and increasingly seek more extreme methods of getting an adrenaline rush. At least a lot of us are.<br /><br />In this future we've taken it to the ultimate level. Robots programmed well and realistic in looks are there for any fantasy. Roman orgy, medieval crusade or western shootout, it's all there for the taking. No more virtual killing in video games, this one the paying public gets to really act out but in perfect safety. That is, until a virus hits that makes the poor robots decide getting their faces blown off isn't so fun and they best fight back. Classic technology coming to bite you back tale. You gotta love that.<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit there are some 1970s-isms in there in terms of fashion, styles and behavioral norms you'll have to look over. Some of the tech is hilarious when compared with today. My microwave has more complicated boards in it! But still, its a fun romp with a good tale to tell and I highly recommend it for those who like classic sci-fi, dystopian movies, near future movies and just plain 1970s movies.
 | product/productId: 1400314690 | review/userId: A10UPYF30K74H0 | review/summary: Life and Miracles | review/text: This DVD was delightful. Full of color, 3D animation, and fast paced action.<br />Any child would love to watch this 30-minute story of Jesus calling the disciples, healing the sick, teachings about God, and Passover. I found it to be quite truthful and followed along with the Bible, but with simple animation and the stories don't always go into much detail. So very young children can watch this and follow along. My teenagers watched this DVD and it held their interest, so you know this has to be good.<br />This DVD also includes 13 trailers of other neat children's DVD's you can buy.  Like Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends, God's Little Princess gigi, Bibleman, and others. Also an interview with the writer/director Wayne Zeitner. Which was very interesting and informative. You can even find some coloring pages to print for your child. So I really think if you have small children or if you know of a family with small children this would be perfect for your library. I don't have small children anymore, but have one super, wonderful grandson that will be getting this DVD.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I receive books free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their Book Review Blogger program/BookSneeze.

 | product/productId: 0767805712 | review/userId: AG2QHKF8RFHZT | review/summary: a completely enveloping experience | review/text: I've seen 'Gattaca' twice, and each time been more moved by it. Its strength is in the simplicity of its premise, and its subtle suggestion of a future at only a slight remove from our own. The acting is low-key, and the emotional tenor of the film is highly controlled, so a lot of the emotion the story makes us feel is internalized --- we feel Vincent's frustration at the glass ceiling dashing his hopes and ambitions, as well as the fabulous Jude Law's guilt and self-recrimination for having had everything going for him, yet failing to achieve. The musical score heightens the story, and lends it a haunting sense of deep sadness at the state to which the world has succombed. There are no special effects --- there is only the here and now, and this movie seems to have timeless things to say about the individual's refusal to be boxed in, and the impossibility of predicting human fate and destiny. The particularities of this future universe keep the focus small, in order to open up a wider, limitless realm of human emotion. 'Gattaca' is a minor gem, an overlooked classic.

I recommend this movie to all ages (opps, a little rough on some of the language so it should be seen first by parents).  As long as you have lived long enough to make a mistake and then not want to any more this movie will move you.  Newman's Best.  As an attorney I can say it is moving and motivating (even though some of the tactics are questionable).  Awesome  supporting cast (James Mason, Jack Warden) and a great interview with Newman on the second CD.  Worth every penny because you will want to watch it again and share it with others.
 | product/productId: 1594351619 | review/userId: A16H7VDGF999OG | review/summary: No one is forcing you to watch, so stop whining. | review/text: Firstly, I'd just like to say that I find it pretty damn hilarious how the men who reviewed this movie call it an "exploitation of women," when this movie couldn't have been farther from the truth. If you're looking for a cheap softcore porn film or lots of nude scenes, this isn't for you.<br /><br />Like sports movies, I'm tired of the less-than-realistic and cheesy rock movies. You don't always make it to the big time. In fact, you don't always catch a break and get a gig playing simply in a club. This movie is the story of one band, Clam Dandy, that did not make it. A true story, by the way, for those of you who complained about the rape and other dramatic elements.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother reviewing every sequence, you'll just have to watch the movie. I liked it. Period. If Gina Gershon isn't reason enough to see this movie, here's another: she sings both the songs and plays the guitar. Now that's sexy.
 | product/productId: 0792841956 | review/userId: AFKZ8Y0I8WE9S | review/summary: Awesome movie, so-so DVD | review/text: Let me start off by saying that Remo Williams is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I first saw it when I was a kid and was huge into Ninja Turtles and comic books, so this movie fits in perfectly for people who like those kind of things.  I love the running on water, bullet dodging, punching holes through boards with fingers, etc.  Greeeat movie!!!<br /><br />However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers here.  The configuration of the DVD is crappy.  They should have done the movie the theatrical widescreen release, not the old-fashioned TV 4:3 format.  If this was widescreen, I would have given it 5 stars.
 | product/productId: 0792836553 | review/userId: A3CWH6VKCTJAD | review/summary: An excellent motion picture. | review/text: When the news broke that MGM had the audacity to remake the hallowed 1935 classic "Mutiny on the Bounty" starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton, the critics were aghast.  As the news leaked out about trouble in production, they whipped themselves into a self-righteous frenzy.  Brando was a lightening rod for criticism because he was renowned as arrogant hothead.  Compared with Gable, who was universally loved and adored, Brando was a boor.  It was almost sacrilegious to put Brando in any part Gable had played.  When the film opened, it never had a chance.  It was ripped to shreds.  Brando was ridiculed as a lower class character actor who couldn't step up to the part, and derided for his dreadful attempt at an English accent.  The film was a box office loser and critics smugly declared they told us so.<p>The film was beset by problems throughout production.  The full-scale replica of the Bounty arrived on location two months after the film was scheduled to begin shooting.  There were three deaths among the film's personnel and the film ran well over budget.  The biggest problems were the result of Brando's constant temper tantrums as he tried to rewrite the entire film from the set.  At least six writers came and went.  After countless confrontations, director Carol Reed gave up and quit to be replaced by Lewis Milestone ("All Quiet on the Western Front').  Milestone was an utterly intractable director that Brando couldn't bully.  The result was a battle between the immovable object and the irresistible force, with daily emotional pyrotechnics that further delayed the film.  Although Milestone usually prevailed in the fracases, this film turned out to be his last in a 37-year career.<p>Over the years, the critics have continued to pillory the film, but the public generally receives it more favorably as time passes.  Though I often disagree with the masses, in this case I concur.  Having seen both the 1935 and 1962 versions, I prefer the latter.  Gable is clearly more charming and dashing in the role, but Brando gives the more complete performance.  Gable's Christian seems far less ruffled by the events that transpire on the Bounty, whereas Brando accomplishes a believable transition from the cavalier rogue to an honorable hero who endures self-torment over the treasonous act.  Though Brando's English accent is oft ridiculed, I have heard far worse.  Part of the problem probably stemmed from the fact that the accent he attempted to imitate was very upper crust and he delivered it with a certain sneering tone that made it seem like he was mocking the English.  Just hearing that accent from the same lips that gave us, "I coulda been a contenda" was a kind of ironic comedy unto itself.<p>Between the Bligh portrayed by Charles Laughton and that depicted by Trevor Howard in the remake, Howard wins hands down for pure detestability.  Most of the production values, such as music, set design and costumes were superior in the remake.  Moreover, the remake was more historically accurate than the original.<p>The film features a youthful Richard Harris in the role of Mills, who gives an excellent performance of the petulant sailor.  Also noteworthy is the lovely Tarita, a native Tahitian who plays Christian's love interest Maimiti, and does a scorching belly dance.  This was Tarita's only film, but to anyone who has seen the film, she will not be soon forgotten.<p>This is an excellent film.  It was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, but it was shut out, trampled by "Lawrence of Arabia".  It is highly entertaining with wonderful costumes, props and sets, fabulous locations and photography, and some terrific performances.  Though many will disagree, I rated it a 10/10.  If one can step back from the controversy that swirled around this film when it debuted, it is an easy film to enjoy.

And she, a 21 year old Yale architecture student, won.<br /><br />That memorial is the beginning of this film/DVD. In fact, I learned a little more about it. I didn't know, for example, that there was some adamant opposition to it. I did know that some Vietnam vets felt it lacked the symbolism on which they insisted. For that reason, the statue of the three troops was added after "The Wall" was completed.<br /><br />The film also shows some of Ms. Linn's other designs, e.g., the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama and the peace chapel at a college in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />I appreciated the film because of the references to these other memorials, and also because Ms. Linn was able to describe her artistic reasoning behind all of them. The Vietnam wall, for example, is to allow the living to meet with the dead; the water that covers many of her memorials is to serve a symbolic purpose.<br /><br />In short, I rather like all her designs. At the same time, if she hadn't been chosen for the Vietnam War Memorial, I don't know that such a film would have been made.<br /><br />That's not to discredit her work, which, again, is great. And I'm glad the film describes so much about all of her designs that I wouldn't have otherwise known.
 | product/productId: 6301798066 | review/userId: A2Y1D4PNZ1G7IH | review/summary: LOVE ME TENDER | review/text: In this western drama set immediately after the Civil War (originally titled "The Reno Brothers"), Elvis appears in the secondary role of Clint Reno. This was the only time in his acting career that Elvis received second billing. Clint, the younger of the four Reno brothers, stayed behind to run the family farm during the war while his older brothers were off fighting for the Confederacy. Star Richard Egan plays Vance Reno, the elderst brother whom the family believes to have been killed in battle. Upon returning home, Vance is shocked to discover that Clint has married Vance's former sweetheart, Cathy, played by Debra Pagent (who appeared in The Ten Commandments). The love triangle, complicated by the greedy actions of some unscrupulous ex-Confederates, eventually pits brother against brother, resulting in Clint's death. The downbeat ending is tempered by the brother's reconciliation as Clint dies in Cathy's arms.<p>Originally titled "The Reno Brothers", this western drama was re-titled after a number of articles announced that advanced sales for "Love Me Tender"--one of the songs recorded for the film--exceeded a million copies. It was the first time advanced sales for a single release had ever suprassed the million mark, and the producers capitalized on the publicity by changing the film's title. <p>The enormous amount of press coverage also affected the film's conclusion. During production, fanzines leaked that Elvis's character was supposed to die near the end of the film. As originally shot, the final scene features Mother Reno solemnly ringing the dinner bell as her three remaining sons toil in the fields. Pain and loss are registered on the faces of Mother Reno and Cathy, who mourn the death of Clint. Elvis's legion of fans were disturbed by the news that their idol was to be killed off in his first film and caused such a commotion that Twentieth Century-Fox shot an alternative ending in which Clint is spared. For reasons known only to the producers the second ending was rejected. Instead a third version of the ending was used and Clint is killed as called for in the original script, but the final shot superimposed a ghostly close-up of Elvis as Clint crooning "Love Me Tender" as his family slowly walks away from his grave. Hence the fans were then left with a final image of Elvis doing what he was famous for--singing.<p>The same promotion surrounding Love Me Tender that generated excitement among the fans also generated loathing among the critics. Many were brutal in their assessment of Elvis's performance, particulary Time Magazine, comparing Elvis's acting and screen presence to that of a sausage, a "Walt Disney Goldfish", a corpse, and a cricket--all in the same brief review.<p>If Elvis cried over the mean-spirited reviews, then he cried all the way to the bank. The film recouped its production costs within three days of release, guaranteeing that Elvis's Hollywood future would be lucrative.<p>Produced for Twentieth Century Fox by David Weisbart. Released November 15, 1956. B&W.

Watch Ettore Scola (C'erovamo tanto amati) ,Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso and 1900)and Kusturica (Underground).<br />The irreverent moods created by this only surrealistic ambassador italian are a song to the freedom , a true 'ode to the joy' and a monumental rendition to the fertile imagination.<br />Amarcord in my view, is the peak of Fellini as dream maker, as story teller and above all as natural and organical sense of humor, in all of its possible and imaginable frequencies, since the virginal, poignant, irreverent, bitter and austere till the most no mercy satire.<br />Watch this unsurpassed film in its genre.<br />One of the glorious achievements not only of the cinema, but the art widely speaking.
 | product/productId: 0790729725 | review/userId: A2EENLV6OQ3DYM | review/summary: Fugettaboutit -- the best crime movie ever made | review/text: If my title seems like hyperbole, you obviously haven't seen this movie.  With all due respects to Mr. Coppola, &quot;Goodfelleas&quot; blows away even &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in  the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the  most creditble crime story ever told.  Unfolding over the course of three  decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid-level mobster who  only turned state's evidence against his fellows after he had no other  choice.  The movie is bursting with memorable characters; Joe Pesci as the  hotheaded mobster, Robert DiNiro as the cold blooded killer-thief, Paul  Sorvino as the head of the family.  If these guys don't put a chill through  you, nothing will.  This is the best movie from one of America's greatest  directors.
 | product/productId: 0792842111 | review/userId: A3AKPY4LXIC24O | review/summary: "Do you spook easily...?" | review/text: The Silence of the Lambs is the first Horror movie to win the Best Picture Academy Award.  While that distinction rightfully belonged to The Exorcist us Horror fans take what we can get.  Certainly the Horror genre didn't need (and still doesn't) an award to validate its importance to film, but an honor is an honor so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Even without all the accolades, The Silence of the Lambs would be revered and considered a classic example of filmmaking.  There is nothing more disconcerting, yet fascinating to the American public than the act of murder.  The fascination is compounded exponentially when murder is committed in quantity.  Add the seeming randomness of serial slayings, the understanding that anybody could be next, and the result is fanaticism.  That's right, Americans are fans of murder.  The bloodier the better, as long as it's far away and happening to someone else.<br /><br />Many serial killers have achieved celebrity status.  Some have become legend, both living and dead.  Hannibal Lecter, although a fictional construct, ranks among them.  Anthony Hopkins unsettling and convincing portrayal of the cannibal doctor is perhaps one of the most talked about film perfomances of all time.  The character of Lecter has since joined the American Lexicon of Boogeymen, usually a realm reserved for supernatural monsters.  The plausibility of Lecter makes him all the more frightening, his deviance coupled with his uncanny intelligence plays upon our fears of strangers, of being eaten, and the ultimate terror of being outsmarted.<br /><br />Somehow Hollywood recognized a superior monster story and awarded it accordingly.  The novel by Thomas Harris is so closely adhered to in script as to almost be one in the same.  In essence watching the film was like watching the book.  When so often the saying that the book is better than the movie unfortunately (but logically) rings true, finding a film that compliments and accentuates the source material is like stumbling upon cinematic gold.<br /><br />The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have.  Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with.  I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.  One thing is for certain, people began to ask what exactly was in the entree at dinner parties, praying the answer wasn't Bob or Lisa.
 | product/productId: 630100843X | review/userId: AY12DBB0U420B | review/summary: From Korea to Granada. | review/text: Last night I watched "Heartbreak Ridge," a Clint Eastwood saga in which Eastwood plays an ultra-tough marine non-commisioned officer who got his credentials at Heartbreak Hill in Korea, not at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. Late in his career he's called in to shape up a batch of new recruits. It's an interesting, if somewhat cliche-ridden movie. I'd suppose that ex-marines would enjoy looking back on all the stereotypes and get a good chuckle. Eastwood is as tough as he is in any of his movies, but there's relatively little fighting, mostly because Eastwood dispatches the bad guys in only a few blows. Add in a bit of romance with an ex-wife and a bit of the war in Granada. In any case, the movie presents a view into the inner life on a military base. I haven't been in the military, but I find it an interesting perspective. "Heartbreak Ridge" is an enjoyable action/adventure movie to watch, but I would not rank it among Eastwood's best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

This movie was advertised as a light comedy but it is,in fact a profound view of the average life of many within the Janese society still trying to find themselves in a whole new world. What was not previously mentioned is a scene when a Japanese opera star sings Silent Night and another that has drunken bar goers try to sing Auld Lang Sang, however spelled. The storyline is one matter, peek at daily life in an era we have seldom seen filmed at the time it happen is quite another. Most highly recommended.

They modified, adjusted, changed melodies to lower keys to suit her abilities. I really like Ronstadt, but this was very disappointing.  Kevin Kline is hilarious the perfect Pirate King; never heard of Rex Smith before or since, and honestly, that voice... well, enough said.<br /><br />Broadway is doing this a lot these days to revivals (look at the travesty they made of Kiss Me, Kate) so they can cast people (celebrities) who either can't or are unable to sing the original show.  It's sad.
 | product/productId: 0790749815 | review/userId: A1C58YXM2A30CY | review/summary: Excellent Hitchcock Thriller! | review/text: With a classy Bernard Hermann score, Hitchcock lets us in on the story of an advertising exec, Mr. Thornhill, who likes his job, considering advertising as exaggerating the facts for the public.<br /><br />(Hitch makes one of his famous on screen appearances, and doesn't quite make the bus!)<br /><br />It's fun, though a bit unrealistic, that an advertising man who was just kidnapped would then follow up on the guys who tried to kidnap him, investigate the hotel room of the "real" Kaplan and go through these adventures. But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Each scene has him take a step closer to finding out more about the kidnappers, narrow escapes, chase scenes and thrilling near-misses.<br /><br />The cinematography is superb. The 30th floor view as Thornhill runs out -- the unusual perspective shots, the mistaken identifies and mistaken situations -- the logical illogic, the puzzles and the plots and plans -- All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.<br /><br />But not for Thornhill.<br /><br />[Some minor plot reveals here]<br /><br />A blonde on the train (but who is she, really?) a little romance & comedy adds to the grim specter of a very long jail sentence or the bad spies rub him out!<br /><br />Best scenes of course include:<br /><br />The biplane scene that sprays bullets rather than insecticide on our poor Mr. Thornhill.<br /><br />The Mt. Rushmore scene that has lots of near misses and very tall heights to climb and nearly be killed by, especially with Martin Landau chasing you down!<br /><br />There's a double-cross, there's James Mason (as actually the evil spy Van Damme), lots of near misses -- I keep saying that but it's true. The film is full of near misses!<br /><br />Recommended, highly so.

His plays, written in the 16th and early 17th centuries for a small repertory theater, are today performed more often and in more countries than ever before...<br /><br />"Julius Caesar" is rich in its insights, the struggle for political power, the embellishment of the mind, and the characters of men...<br /><br />Joseph L. Mankiewicz captures Shakespeare's characters in elegant visuals projecting the beauty of the language, producing civilized entertainment... Its message fills the screen with vitality on the plains of Shakespeare's imagination...<br /><br />The film is set in Rome 44 B.C. The city is rich with the privileges of its empire, much of it caused by the pretentious Caesar (Louis Calhern) appointing himself dictator... Caesar's greater character flaw, thinking that he is far above others and somehow invincible...<br /><br />Loyal to Caesar is Mark Antony (Marlon Brando), a brave, intelligent, pleasure-loving cunning man - a character with many hidden traits, misunderstood by all...<br /><br />Mark Anthony looks at life as a game in which he had a signified part to play... He seems slow to emerge, until he is forced to show his true potential... He is devoted and prefers to be dependent upon Caesar... He wants the crown of emperor to be given to him, so all conflicts could be avoided...<br /><br />But Brutus (James Mason), an old friend of Caesar, is torn between his personal feelings and his integrity and idealism where the Romans would possess peace, liberty and freedom...<br /><br />The scrupulous, unselfish Brutus resents Caesar's ambition as absolute ruler... Being very honorable, but very naive, he underestimates Mark Antony, perceiving him as a person who didn't always take life seriously and therefore - he is not a cautious thinker...<br /><br />The story begins on a festival day as Caesar and his entourage make their way to the stadium... On the way, a blind beggar warns Caesar of 'The Ides of March' (On the middle of the month, the daggers came from every side...) but he is ignored...<br /><br />In the stadium, the sarcastic Cassius (John Gielgud) sees Brutus as the influential Roman able to unite the nobles in the conspiracy... He implores him to join his cause... For him, Caesar has become too powerful and too popular... He must be removed from power...<br /><br />Cassius is the most significant character for his ability to perceive the true motives of the characters... He thinks the nobility of Rome is responsible for the government of Rome... Brutus, the back-bone of the plan, agrees to the plot, but refuses Cassius's proposal to slain Mark Antony...<br /><br />After the conspirators have left, Brutus' wife Portia (Deborah Kerr) asks to know what it is that worries him...<br /><br />Caesar's wife, Calpurnia (Greer Garson) begs her husband to stay home and not to go to the Senate, for fear of danger... As a superstitious woman she was convinced that some falling meteors are warnings of her husband's death... But Caesar believes his friends have assembled to offer him the crown of emperor... So he moves forward, leaving unopened letter which lists the conspirators...

 | product/productId: 0310275253 | review/userId: A3SED48SWHNV56 | review/summary: It's not just talking to yourself with your hands in the air! | review/text: Phil Yancey writes: "If I had to answer the question, 'Why Pray?' in one sentence, it would be: 'Because Jesus did.'"<br /><br />And to what end?  Phil Yancey "knows that the main purpose of prayer is not to make life easier, but to know God" (Review, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE SENTINEL).<br /><br />"How long, O Lord?" is another Frequently Asked Question.  But prayer is not like a five-paragraph essay for your English class.  Some Christians, men especially, are much too concerned about length.  Jesus often asked his Twelve Disciples to bow their heads for "a WORD of prayer."  But once you got him started, Jesus didn't quit.  He could talk to his Father all night long.  The Twelve would grow tired of listening, and fall asleep.  More than once they awoke for breakfast, and Jesus was still talking.<br /><br />So that's first rule of thumb: "Pray without ceasing."<br /><br />The other good rule of thumb is:  "Don't let anyone else overhear."  Most people, when they pray to God, are not really interested in having a meaningful conversation.  Usually, they just want to ask Him for stuff: Help me, Lord, to find my car keys (a boyfriend / job / rent-controlled apartment).  Please, O Lord, cure my headache (lung cancer / teen acne).  O Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? (a colour TV? / a night on the town?).  Sometimes, if you have enough faith, prayer actually does work.<br /><br />Next tip:  Roll with the punches.  The Lord answers EVERY prayer:  It's just that sometimes His answer is Yes, and sometimes His answer is No.<br /><br />(Caveat: a fire hydrant or a Buddha statue will answer every prayer with one of the same two replies, yes or no, in roughly the same proportions, as Jesus will do.  But  if you pray to an idol, Jesus may kill you; so I'm with Phil Yancey on this one: Pray to Jesus, it's safer.)<br /><br />Yancey freely admits that God will not heal an amputated limb, or cystic fibrosis, or pancreatic cancer.  He also concedes that unless God takes a special liking to you (videlicet, Moses, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, George W. Bush), the Lord is gonna do what the Lord is gonna do.  So if you need to pray, the best strategy is to figure out what God will do anyway, and to pray for that.<br /><br />Example:  "Dear Lord, please don't allow my boyfriend to get struck by lightning." Or: "Please, Lord, don't let a piano fall from the sky on my boss's head."  Or:  "Our Father who art in Heaven, please permit me to pay taxes to the government."  Or: "Dear Lord, please give us sunshine for our church picnic Saturday afternoon, as forecast on the Weather Channel" (but that last one can be a little chancy).<br /><br />And at bedtime, you should say:  "Phew!  Thanks, Lord.  You're amazing!"<br /><br />If your child or parent or friend has a terminal illness, it's okay to ask God, politely, for that person to be healed.  Just don't pester Him if the answer is "No."  Yancey explains:  "When I pray for another person, I am praying for God to open my eyes so that I can see that person as God does, and then enter into the stream of love that God already directs towards that person," such as giving him a good dose of pancreatic cancer or cystic fibrosis.<br /><br />Here are some ways not to pray:<br /><br />* "O Lord, thousands of children die each day from malnutrition.  Feed them."<br />* "Dear God, millions suffer from untreated disease.  Heal them."<br />* "O Lord, will You please steer that big hurricane in some other direction than the Gulf Coast of the United States?"<br /><br />God is powerful, and He can often do things that will surprise you.  But don't expect Yahveh, or Jesus for that matter, to smile on overly-ambitious prayer requests.  Those kinds of prayers actually annoy Him, because they fall on His ears like veiled criticism, or (worse) like begging, which--because He is holy--He cannot tolerate.<br /><br />It used to be, when I talked to God, I never got half of what I asked for.  But I was using the wrong system.  Phil Yancey's book, PRAYER: DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?, has made a big, big difference. Ever since I read it, my prayers have scored close to 60/40.  So I've got no complaints.<br /><br /> - L.

The extra scenes on this DVD are interesting and entertaining. If you're looking for a fun movie (one that you'll enjoy as much as the kids), this is a great choice.<p>However, note that many of the 'extra features' are for Windows only - they aren't available on DVD players or on Macintosh. Also, if you want to see all the extra scenes, you'll need to  repeatedly backtrack through the same navigational screens - it gets VERY tedious.<p>I certainly recommend the video, but I think the producers have done a poor job with the DVD, and the packaging and advertising are quite deceptive.

Heres why u should buy this dvd 1.)This movie is great, a classic horror movie saw as one of the greatest horror films of all time. 2.)The special features on this dvd make the movie 1,000 times better. The alternate scenes are pretty cool and its always good to see some bloopers. Its also very cool to hear the commentary, what it was like to make the film and other interesting stuff. 3.) I met Gunnar Hanson (Leatherface) and he is a great guy, buy the movie to get him some royalties ;-)
 | product/productId: 6300263657 | review/userId: AFHNNJFCQB4RM | review/summary: Nostalgic | review/text: I was surprised at how young bill Murray looked. It was also strange to see all those old cars and hair cuts that I once remembered as new. As a historical remembrance Meatsballs was much more interesting that otherwise viewed outside that context.<br /><br />Overall meatballs was still kind of funny with a couple of real gems in there. The "It just doesn't matter" chant was fantastic, as well as Bill Murray protending to be the other camps director.<br /><br />I also noticed the film seemed to have more of a romantic innocence than many modern day films. Though the counselors seemed to always be trying to get some, in the end they were portrayed as romantic with long term interest. I felt this more healthy than many T.V. sitcoms where the characters jumped from relationship to relationship.<br /><br />In short Meatballs is the type of film you view every ten years and laugh at a couple of really good scenes, smirk your way through the rest, and marvel at how old you must be getting.

I always wondered if they would make a sequel in the future nope not as of yet the story was cool the characters were well the aliens were so 80's but it was fun to watch and not boring.It was the same with Flight Of The Navigator sad it would've been interesting to say the least for a cool sequel!.But I think it is the return of the 80's an example would be the movies for 2008,2010!

For those that have not, do! Now!<br /><br />George Romero directs. Not his most groundbreaking film (no pun intended), that would be "Night of the Living Dead." Not his best known sequel, that would be "Dawn of the Dead." This is not a sequel at all, but it's Romero's most entertaining film & my favorite of his!<br /><br />Written by Stephen King. Make up effects from Tom Savani, are wonderfully gruesome!<br /><br />My favorite episode, "The Crate!"<br /><br />"Just tell it, to call you Billy." LOL!<br /><br />Worth the Blu ray upgrade!

And I know it is all comic book violence/black comedy but there is still way too high of a body count (both Martian and Earthling) for me.  Do I personally find it amusing when a trailer dwelling Kansas couple watches their soldier son get vaporized on live television? Er No.  Or when a group of Cub Scouts are crushed by the Washington Monument? No again. I even have to say no to the enjoyment value of members of Congress being assassinated with ray guns while the president is killed in a manner reminiscent of the chest bursting scene in ALIEN.  Those are just some samples of the  Earthling casualties.  And when the Martians' heads begin to explode after hearing a certain type of music they leave quite an unpleasant gooey green substance in their wake.  Suffice it to say that this one is not for the kiddies.  Since this "comedy" lacks clever dialogue or amusing situations I can't recommend it for the adults either.

This movie makes scream look like a gorefest, and most of the gore described is not even in the film. unless of course plastic eye balls, and absolutly pathetic fake blood that looks exactly like Hersheys syrup is considerd gory... im also wondering why the hell the dead bodys on the back of the case wernt even in the film... to sum it up... pathetic...utterly pathetic.
 | product/productId: 0764006770 | review/userId: A363QRXP83K8ZE | review/summary: Criminally unavailable homocidal automotive classic | review/text: Make no mistake, the high price for a used copy of this 1977 b-movie is no typo.  Fans of The Car want this movie on DVD, and they'll pay for it.<br /><br />They don't make movies like this anymore, not for theatrical release.  James Brolin is a small-time Sheriff in Utah whose town is terrorized by 'The Car', a mysterious souped-up 1970 Lincoln boat that loves running down a variety of movie-victim-types.  There's no driver in the car, naturally, but something is making that massive foghorn go HOOOOOONK before and after it barrells over another hapless fool ("I think I hear the engine of that damn car...tell me what to do!")<br /><br />This film was briefly available on DVD and now highly sought after.  Chances are, you won't be happening upon this by accident, though the used price is still high...and movies like this have been rather good about reappearing in extra-reverent DVD form of late.  The trailer is great for laughs--keep in mind this appeared just after Jaws (so it's like Car-Shark).<br /><br />Far more b-movie-ish and plain cheesy for laughs, The Car is probably more fun than Christine and certainly better than The Wraith (another film lacking an in-print DVD and the subject for a different review).  I'm surprised this formula hasn't been milked of late.  Perhaps they were trying to say something about the era of massive, 5,000 lb American gas guzzlers running down small-town folk....perhaps the film warrants a remake (The SUV).<br /><br />I genuinely think a new dexuxo Car DVD is imminent...I can feel it.  You can hear the honking in the distance.  Like Class of '84, I know it'll eventually show up.  But in the meantime, if you really must...

 | product/productId: 0767851897 | review/userId: A37S3ACL57LN62 | review/summary: "I prayed once too often." | review/text: When ex-soldier Maurice Bendrix (Van Johnson) decides to write a story on the war effort at home, he visits Henry Miles (Peter Cushing) in his home for an interview. Maurice meets Henry's wife Sarah (Deborah Kerr) there and there is an instant attraction between them. They begin an affair, but it is abruptly stopped. Maurice cannot figure out why and Sarah won't tell him, but her reason is wrought out of her love for him and a promise she made.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is the direction. Edward Dmytryk was better suited to film noir, and he attempts to make this film resemble that genre. In truth, it should have been an out and out romance, and although his choices do make the movie more mysterious, it compromises the validity of the love story. Kerr and Johnson have adequate chemistry together, but Kerr is the obvious standout. Johnson plays his role as a hardened lover confused by Sarah's actions; in some ways he seems wooden, but that is appropriate for the role. Kerr is an emotional powerhouse and shines in every scene she is in, especially toward the end.<br /><br />Overall, The End of the Affair is a good movie with several interesting scenes. It was remade in the 90s, and it was an odd choice to include the featurette from the remake on this DVD.

Naturally, when I got a DVD player, this was one of the first films that I wanted.  Thankfully, I took this edition out of the library rather than purchasing it, because I would have kicked myself forever for buying it.  My advice?  Go for another edition with more extras, or buy the VHS version.  It's not worth the money.  I only gave this one star because the computer kicked it back without a rating.

 | product/productId: 0790732300 | review/userId: A3NKFB39AIEN8W | review/summary: The real Dark Knight | review/text: This is a very solid intro into the Dirty Harry series, featuring The Scorpio Killer. The film also establishes the Dirty Harry myth and, most importantly, provides the answer as to why he's called "Dirty Harry."<br /><br />The film's axis is the conflict of criminal justice--the rights of the criminal--and, through Harry, the rights of the victims. Dirty Harry walks the fine line separating the law and the bad guys, often defying his superiors, disregarding the law,  breaking the law, and even becoming the law. Throughout the film,we slowly come to understand Harry but not completely. His world-view is black and white and his methods gets better and faster results than the courts and the legal process, characterized in the film as cool, bureaucratic, and slanted in favor of the criminal, personified by the Scorpio killer.<br /><br />The film runs around 2 hours, a fast 2 hours that you won't notice because the film is so entertaining and often funny. I like the line he uses in this film, "Do you feel lucky?," he asks a criminal who reaches for his gun, as he's aiming the barrel of his 44 magnum at the guy's head. There are many funny moments in this film. A solid buy for only 9 bucks.

Harrison Ford as always is perfect in this role as the president of the United States, and  the rest of the cast give good performances also. The action scenes in this  movie are clever, original, suspenseful. The DVD is also great while there  arent many extras on the disc the transfer was just as good as it was in  theaters if not better, the sound is actually better and if you have a good  sound system it's even better.

 | product/productId: 6300263657 | review/userId: A3QTP2CI1BDV0M | review/summary: Funny Movie | review/text: "Meatballs" is Bill Murray's movie.  He makes it work.  From beginning to end he gives us a non-stop stream of funny lines and crazy antics.<br /><br />I believe we're seeing him (Murray) at his peak here.  He's not funny at all these days, but back in the 70s he was the funniest person in the entertainment industry, and in "Meatballs" he is at the top of his game.  I would pick Bill Murray (at his peak) over Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, or Robin Williams.<br /><br />The story ... your basic summer camp situation ... is brought to life and made hilarious.  Bill leads the way, but he does get some help.  The supporting cast is actually pretty good.  They were well chosen for their respective roles, and are believable and likable.  Chris Makepeace,the "short depressed kid we ordered" is very effective as the sensative camper who is shunned by the other campers.  Jack Blum, as Spaz, is excellent.  I think the creation of the Spaz character is a stroke of movie genius, and Jack makes the part work ... making me wonder if maybe he is that way in real life.  Kristine DeBell is very nice as the counselor A.L. ... very likable.<br /><br />Bill Murray handles the funny guy role (who is actually a caring guy) with ease.  His scenes with Chris Makepeace are very real, very touching ... and, whether he wanted to or not, Bill gave quite a bit of depth to the Tripper character.<br /><br />The humor does, at times, cross over the line into questionable taste.  For some reason though, when Bill Murray makes a dirty joke, we are not offended.  It's as if we know he's only bluffing and is not really that way.  Personally, I think his clean material is better than that stuff, but if we want Bill Murray, I guess we have to take the whole package ... and we get a wide variety of humor here.<br /><br />But the movie is funny and entertaining ... beginning to end.  And it holds up well under repeated viewing.

Wayne's biplane is seen much in episode 1, but then only in bits in episodes 2, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12.  The sky written warnings from The Eagle are animated shots.  Most of the action takes place on foot and in automobiles.<br /><br />For me, the plot was too thin to hold much interest, with a lot of back and forth to keep you guessing on who the mysterious Eagle turned out to be.  It is more of a historical curiosity of the Duke early in his career.<br /><br />It was also interesting thing seeing the 1931/2 California environs used for shooting.  One building has Van Nuys as part of it's name, but I don't know if the exteriors were shot solely there.

 | product/productId: 0792841409 | review/userId: A2BHWOS5PUGU78 | review/summary: Humanity over Brutality | review/text: Stanley Kubrick didn't make this a violent film. There's a charge or two, and a bit of reloading here and there, but all in all weapons aren't the stars of this film like most war movies these days, the people are.<p>"Paths of Glory" is an interesting and superb in that it gets to the point faster and more unclicheed than any other war film I've ever seen. And the point is that human life is important, not the brutality of war or the crookedness of politics, not to say they aren't clearly represented in this film, but Kubrick makes it clear that what we're dealing with is life and death. and he does it in splendid style.<p>The movie is short, around 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it's simple,  no elaborate special effects, sets, costumes, or cinematography. It's bleak looking, but it fills the screen because it's real. And it surprises you, you experience a saddening and partly depressing yet intriguing and exciting film, and then they give you a strange victory and an ending that is thoroughly uplifting and beautiful. It's trying to portay rather than meticulously copy, and in striving to portray and relate to a theme, it achieves a higher level than even the best modern war films. It doesn't try to outdo or out speak or out blow things up- it stays simple. <p>Here are some examples: Take the cinematography.  Kubrick was a photographer so he knew how to set up his shots to maximum effect with as little palabra. There's very spartan use of music, so at one of the most moving moments in the film that is a direct on screen use of music, it becomes one of the greatest moments in film history. Dialogue written by a collaboration of authors is not cliche or sappy, attempts at sentimental soldier speak are rough but to the point and sound fresh. The actors are portraying Frenchmen, but come in an assortment of authentic American and British accents which have very little in common with fluid and lovely French dialects, but the actors reach the base humanity needed to run the film and the go with it.<p>This is a superior war film not because of its use of special effects, it's blood and gore, or even it's amazing factual representation, but because of it's awareness of humanity in the face of adversity. It cares about real human emotions not recycled Hollywood ones they got out of the back lot. I'm not saying those aren't important, or that they're useless, not at all. But there are times when the fireworks can get old, but people never do.
 | product/productId: 0783241569 | review/userId: APNCG6U29ORR | review/summary: It's been a long time... | review/text: This is truly a lovely movie, and it has been a long time since a romantic comedy has been this enjoyable.  This movie may remind you of &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; or &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, where the  couples are clearly meant for each other, yet have obstacles they must  overcome. The acting and dialogue are superb! Hugh Grant, a world-famous  actor, is completely convincing as an average bloke, while Julia Roberts  goes by Anna Scott and plays herself, a &quot;heavenly&quot; movie  star.<p>One review of this movie called it &quot;pure fairy tale.&quot;  As  long as you can believe that it is possible for an actress to truly be a  &quot;good person,&quot; that she may actually want to live a relatively  &quot;normal&quot; life outside of her acting career and may want to start  a family of her own, then this statement is false.  One specific scene  mentioned as difficult to believe was the initial kiss that takes place  quite soon after they meet.  However, there are two reasons why this scene  is believable.  First, it is quite obvious that she is impressed from the  start with his wit, sensitivity, and honesty, especially compared to the  other men who are falling over themselves when they meet her.  Secondly,  this kiss may be a sort of test.  In a city filled with reporters trying to  get a story and her pictures plastered everywhere, her life has to be  secretive as much as possible.  Perhaps she wanted to see if she would be  reading about the incident in the next day's paper before she allowed  herself to get too close.  She gave him quite the opportunity to brag to  his friends or family, but he does not.<p>This movie is quite entertaining  to watch the first, second and even fifth time.

I just wanted to point out one scene in Taxi Driver that I havent heard many people talk about. I believe Travis is watchin Soul Train or something of that sort and there is a slow song playing and everyone is dancing in couples. You then see Travis's face and you can almost see the tears and despair in his face. He sees eveyone on the T.V. with someone, with some form of companionship, whether it be just for TV or real. When they show Travis's face, you can tell he realizes he'll never have that. The lonliness in his face is saddening and I think this one scene really brings home the lonliness and despair Travis feels.
 | product/productId: 6300181553 | review/userId: A1K94LXX833JTT | review/summary: New 3-disc Collector's Set due out October 14th, 2008!  Details compared | review/text: This is one of the great films, with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire doing some of their most memorable work to some of the better music of Irving Berlin, including the debut of his all-time most popular "White Christmas."  The plot is clever, if somewhat silly, the writing sharp, with lots of laughs, romance, ups and downs, and a happy ending for all.  If you don't already have the movie, the new Collector's Set will certainly be the nicest package.  But this 2006 Special Edition may have all you really need.  The new Collector's Set will have a few new features not in the Special Edition:<br /><br />-- a colorized version of the movie - don't worry, the original black-and-white version is included too<br />-- a featurette on colorizing the movie<br />-- a soundtrack CD (which is the third disc of the set)<br /><br />The soundtrack CD would be a very nice bonus, I think.  The new Collector's Set will also include all the special features from this Special Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by film historian Ken Barnes with archival audio segments from Crosby, Astaire and Crosby's longtime music director John Scott Trotter<br />-- "A Couple of Song & Dance Men," a biographical documentary about Crosby and Astaire with Barnes and Astaire's daughter Ava Astaire McKenzie (44:30)<br />-- "All Singing, All Dancing," a featurette on making musicals, again with Barnes (7:15)<br />-- the original theatrical trailer<br /><br />Like this DVD, the new set will preserve the original 1.33:1 full screen format in both the black-and-white and colorized versions.  The studio announcement for the new set doesn't say whether the video or sound will be remastered.  The image and sound quality of the Special Edition is good but not exceptional, with room for improvement; the new one should be at least that good.<br /><br />This 1942 film centers on Jim (Crosby), a singer and part of a successful three-person New York nightclub act with dancer Ted (Astaire) and singer and dancer Lila (Virginia Dale).  Their act portrays a rivalry between the two men over Lila's affections, spelled out in terms of a contest between singing and dancing.  Life imitates art, as Jim decides to leave the harried show business life and buy a farm in Connecticut, thinking he'll take Lila as his bride and they'll happily live the simple life together.  But Ted has other ideas, and Lila chooses to stay with Ted in show biz, so Jim starts his new life on the farm alone.  Soon learning that the simple farming life isn't as carefree as he had imagined, Jim hatches the idea of turning the farm into Holiday Inn, a lodge with nightclub entertainment open only for public holidays.  Naturally, events bring Ted, just dumped by Lila, out to the farm, where a new rivalry develops over Jim's new love interest (Marjorie Reynolds).  Much scheming, misunderstanding, singing and dancing and romancing ensue.<br /><br />Both Crosby and Astaire were at their cinematic peaks in 1942.  The way they interact is great fun and worth seeing the film for by itself.  The songs included many new Irving Berlin numbers, with highlights "Lazy," "Be Careful, It's My Heart," "White Christmas," of course, and the reused "Easter Parade" all sung by Crosby.  Astaire was actually a fine singer himself, and did "You're Easy to Dance With" full justice.  As good as Crosby and the music is, what really steals the show for me is some of Astaire's all-time best dancing, especially a hilarious drunken reprise of "You're Easy to Dance With" with Reynolds, and the immortal "Let's Say It with Firecrackers" routine, a solo he's portrayed as improvising with pockets full of firecrackers as his props.<br /><br />There might be a bit of controversy over a number done in blackface, which was still popular at the time, and which is accompanied by the wonderful black character actress Louise Beavers, as Crosby's maid/cook, portraying some stereotypes not so well appreciated today.  There is also a reminder of the time in the form of a patriotic montage supporting the war effort, which was just beginning.<br /><br />If you like old movies at all, are looking for a classic holiday movie (this one ends up at Christmas), or are a fan of Crosby or Astaire, this is a must, whatever edition you prefer.

 | product/productId: 0790744236 | review/userId: AKKSHEGRQVQRK | review/summary: No Mock Heroics -- This is the Real Thing.  Beautifully Done | review/text: If you're looking for mock Hollywood heroics or a bloated 'action movie', try The Flying Tigers or The Fighting Seabees.  This beautifully made, understated film is about the courage and dedication of the forsaken Phillipine defenders in 1941-42. In particular, the scene in which a radio announces the American surrender tells what those early days were really like. John Ford, who served in the Navy, casts Robert Montgomery as a PT squadron leader (in fact, Commander Montgomery served in the same PT squadron with John Kennedy).  The b&amp;w photography is outstanding, often mesmerizing, quite unique for a war film, with locations that are dead ringers for the originals.  Adapted from the 1942 Pulitzer prize book by a reporter who was on the scene, it follows the true story fairly closely.  Every performance is right-on, as are the combat scenes.  Not a pumped-up excercise in flag waving; rather, it's a well executed tale of courage in desperate times.  Every scene fascinates with the ambiance of its time and place, and with chilling historical accuracy.  If the ending doesn't get a grip on you, you're a lost cause.  And, yes, Doug MacArthur is treated like a god -- which, in those days, he was.  No ostentatious preaching here; it's understated brilliance from start to finish, and an education in an earlier generation's attitude toward duty, integrity, and sacrifice.  Bruce Willis fans stay clear; this is a war movie for grown-ups.
 | product/productId: 0767845722 | review/userId: A196WS5CFSNEW0 | review/summary: Disney's Pocahantas was more accurate... | review/text: I know all the critics panned this film, but a few people I know said it was still worth watching. They were wrong. I'm pretty sure the only reason Jovovich even got the role is because her husband's the director. I can promise you it wasn't because of her acting ability. <p>I truly respect Joan of Arc and find her story quite inspiring. This film turned a strong, noble woman into a babbling psycho bent on revenge for something that never even happened. Very, very few things in this film were even historically accurate. <p>John Malcovich and Dustin Hoffman must've lost a bet...that's the only explanation I can think of for their prescence in this filth. <p>The film does have Braveheart level (in violence, not quality) battle scenes, so you may want to be careful about letting little ones view this. There is a scene in the very beginning where young Joan witnesses her sister get brutally killed and then raped, which was truly disturbing. In addition to being one of the creepiest moments on film, the event never actually happened.<p>If you really want to know the story of Joan of Arc, watch any other film. If all you want is 2 and a half hours of mind numbing battles with special effects, this is your flick.

 | product/productId: 5555672322 | review/userId: A2CT2SA6KFE8GC | review/summary: Enter.....The Mask!! | review/text: Even though this begins right after the end of part 2, Jason seems to have grown about twice the size he was in that film.  He's also now completely bald, he seems to have lost all of his hair in that half hour time frame.  The disco theme is pretty catchy, and the 3D thing looks quite dumb.  It would be nice if the dvd came with glasses and the film was in 3D.  When the van full of victims pulls up(as it always seems to in these the beginning of these films.  They might as well have an announcer say, "Lets meet our victims, ladies and gentlemen"), you will identify almost immediately who the lucky one is who'll survive.  That point is pounded home even more when she refuses the advances of her old boyfriend.  And of course, as you probably already know, Jason gets his hands on that hockey mask in this one, and he must love it, coz he's never without it again.  In fact, he manages to get it back after losing it a few times, and even gets a brand new one in 8.  No different than the rest, but I have to admit that this one has what I feel to be the creepiest moment in the series.  These films are far from being scary, but there's a dream sequence at the end of this film that's pretty well done and might even give you the chills.

 | product/productId: 6300214311 | review/userId: A2QOQKEG2VTX48 | review/summary: The Typical Horror Movie on the 80's | review/text: Like many other films of its time, "Friday the 13th Part 3" offers nothing but (...), drugs, and tons of blood. And just to think, that this is one of the better films in the series. First of all, this movie is okay in its sense to add a little suspense into the movie, but the act gets old quick when Jason (Richard Brooker) is everywhere, yet he rarely pops out to kill someone. It's just like a movie from the "Halloween" series, just much, much cheesier and duller. The acting, unlike the first two installments, is a bad mix. I could never get over the casting either. In this movie, there is a group of six (...)driven college aged students who are staying at a cabin on the lake in the woods. Then there are these two people who to be about 35 years old who consistantly smoke weed and talk like hippies (...). To add more deaths, the writers decided to throw in dead meat, which turned out to be suprisingly the most interesting characters of the whole movie. They were three bikers, with Gloria Fox as my favorite playing the tough-girl Fox. Despite its many flaws, the movie does connect the thrid installment and the second installment very well, (...) does an excellent job creating a spooky atmosphere, even despite his bad actors. Audiances will notice objects always flying in their direction, which is becuase the film was originally shown in 3D (and hopefully they will discover a way to bring that 3D to DVD someday). But even with the consistant flying objects, the film makes me think the most about the 80's, with its funky opening theme and rad clothing, plus of course Jason was a phenominon back then. (...)

Beautiful photography overall. We were entranced throughout the whole show...and our teenage son and his friend even watched most of it with us(of their own accord.) If we could give more than 5 stars we would.
 | product/productId: 0790741814 | review/userId: AATS9Q7VJ4PFI | review/summary: Awe Inspiring Title, Segmented Movie | review/text: THE BIG RED ONE - RECONSTRUCTED is a significant improvement over the old VHS release. The movie is crisp, sound effects improved, and much of Samuel Fuller's cut footage has been restored to the film.<br /><br />In addition to being the title to the movie, THE BIG RED ONE is the nickname of the US Army's 1st Infantry Division. The shoulder patch is simply a blood-red number 1 on a green/brown background. The film follows a sergeant, played by Lee Marvin, and his squad from the North African landings through to the surrender of Nazi Germany. The squad focuses on four soldiers in the squad that we come to know as the four horseman. Essentially, these soldiers, in addition to their squad leader Lee Marvin, survive the war.<br /><br />The restoration of Fuller's footage greatly improved what was otherwise a miserable film. Whenever a film has to resort to promoting itself "based on real events" you know that it is just an excuse for a poorly made film. In the original version of this film, the movie seemed to be a bunch of loosely connected vignettes serving no purpose. The new release ties the separate scenes together much better than the 1980 movie ever did.<br /><br />The sound effects, specifically the small arms reports and explosions, have been excellently remixed so that they sound more like what we would expect to hear in BAND OF BROTHERS, WINDTALKERS, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The old version of the movie stuck with rifle, machine gun, and artillery sound effects that were straight out of COMBAT!, THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN, THE DIRTY DOZEN, and other films that used the standard 1950 - 1970 ordnance sounds.<br /><br />In almost every major scene there is additional footage inserted. Particularly impressive are the battles in the Roman ampitheater, expanded Kassarine Pass attack, and Battle of the Bulge segment.<br /><br />Overall, this Reconstruction is a much better, and more watchable, war film.<br /><br />Still, the film could have been better.<br /><br />Lee Marvin would have been the perfect choice for the sergeant if this film had been made in the 1950's. Marvin was a great actor, but by the late 1970s he was more fit for the role of a crusty old mountain man, not a spry young squad leader. No visible attempt was made to soften Marvin's aged appearance. Lee Marvin had already seen his share of real combat during World War Two in the Pacific. In the mid 1950s, Marvin already appeared as a very believable career lieutenant colonel in the movie ATTACK! Ten years later Marvin appeared as a major in his hallmark film THE DIRTY DOZEN. THE DIRTY DOZEN should have been Marvin's last foray as a combat soldier -- though he would reprise his DIRTY DOZEN role in the mid 1980's in a DIRTY DOZEN television movie.<br /><br />In THE BIG RED ONE it is difficult to imagine Marvin as a white-haired three-stripe sergeant -- particularly as in the beginning of THE BIG RED ONE we are introduced to Marvin as a soldier in the First World War. At the very least, this career soldier should have been a division sergeant major by the time the WWII came along. With the exception of Marvin's age, he would have been the perfect choice for the squad leader. Keep in mind that at the time Samuel Fuller was also considering none-too-youthful John Wayne for the same part.<br /><br />In the restored DVD we get to see more of Siegfried Raush. If you recall, in PATTON Raush portrayed the German intelligence officer who tracked Patton at German Army headquarters.  In RED ONE Raush plays the German infantry sergeant who always seems to come into contact with Marvin's squad in North Africa, Sicily, France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. In fact, after watching the Reconstructed DVD, this was the first time that I realized that Raush had a recurring part through the entire movie. We first meet him when he tommy-guns a deserter in Tunisia and finish with Marvin stabbing him with a trench knife in the last few minutes of the film.<br /><br />Raush's part would have been better served if he did not speak at all. In fact, most of the French and German dialogue is contrived to the point of being phony. I don't buy the Vichy French soldiers debating whether or not they should shoot at Americans. The speech by the German soldier contemplating desertion is also cheesy and out of place. The final ill-placed conversation is between Raush and a soon to be deceased countess seems as if it belongs in a different movie.<br /><br />A majority of the film was shot in Israel. Israel natually doubles well for Mediterranean locations, but it is a stretch for northern European locales. The one thing I think they could have done better in the Reconstructed movie was to computer insert an invasion fleet into the beach landing scenes. In the film the squad lands on three beaches, and in all three amphibious landings we can clearly see, with the exception of a solitary landing craft during the D-Day landings, that there are absolutely no ships on the water. These guys must have had a long swim.<br /><br />On the other hand, the re-released DVD includes additional French location shooting doubling as France, Belgium, the Huertgen Forest, and the Ardennes. In the theatrical release and subsequent VHS issue, most of the 1944-45 sequences were cut from the movie.<br /><br />THE BIG RED ONE on DVD is worth the effort. I recommend you pitch your old VHS copy and spend an enjoyable afternoon watch the Reconstructed DVD release and special features.

JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW COLLECTOR'S BOX SET COMING OUT SOON. READ BELOW.<br /><br />Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial). Thanks to Bits reader Matt K. for the heads-up on this.

 | product/productId: 6300215512 | review/userId: A1SDPA1J98UP4L | review/summary: Where Do Faded Hollywood Doves Go To Die? | review/text: Sunset Boulevard answers the age old question, Where Do Faded Hollywood Doves Go To Die? in truly greusome detail as we meet one Miss Norma Desmond.  Technically this is my most favorite picture of all time.  Norma Desmond is one truly twisted sister a fictional old film star now past it yet looking for her come back.  The movies are in her old tired blood and she seeks a close up like a heroin addict hunts for their next drug fix.  Norma Desmond courts that most elusive prey called youth and let me tell you this film chronicles the hunt which is driving her and all who surround her quite and quietly mad.<br /><br />Norma is yet another aging former star, a victim of that all too real Hollywood malady of beleiving her own press,  Norma in her heyday sowed the wind in treating people like dirt and reaped the worldwind as Hollywood disgarded her like yesterdays news when the wrinkles showed up and the glamour wore off.  Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond because she was old enough to remember silent pictures and she had the exzagerated hand gesticulations and facial contortions used in the silent move era to convey feelings in a time before Talkies.<br /><br />Again if what I shared with you thus far was all there was to this movie it would be fun to watch but oh no.  Norma Desmond not only wants to re-energize her dead film career she wants a boy toy to replace the now dead monkey and friend she lives with in her faded dusty mansion that looks like a cross between a haunted house set, mad house and a large dusty tomb.  The film has an extra creepy feel as at the beginning you learn it is a story noir being told to you by a man now very dead.  Yes this is a story told by the dead victim of an explosive mixture of two demeanted peoples poison dreams and their immoral selfish willingness to do any wicked thing to make them come true.<br /><br />What makes Sunset Boulevard so good is that it feels so right.  Norma Desmond is such a man hungry self absorbed old babe and what started out as her lover's iron sense of dignity turns slowly into cotton candy norma consumes with a jaded passion.  Norma with all the deliberate cunning of a black widow spider slowly injects her lover with the potent venom of co-dependency which litterally eat away the kept man's backbone till he yields to her every whim for a time.  Helping Sunset Bolevard develop and keep its horrific mood is also the creepy music score which you can hear become more demented and manic as the characters lives and dignity self destruct as their tormented souls entertwine beyond hope of ever escaping each others perverse deadly embrace.<br /><br />There is plenty of dark humor in this Norma Desmonds Sunset Boulevard.  If this is a horror movie it is traggic horror.  Sunset Boulevard is certainly Psychological horror showing what twisted shallow minded people do to themselves and each other if their lusts for money, power and fame are unleashed by the proper situations.  Watching this movie is like watching to two animals eat each other alive while you the audience are enticed to take bets on which one will survive in the end.<br /><br />Finally this movie has a few mwmoriable lines too.  Her Lover says, ... "Hey You're Norma Desmond, You used to be BIG!"... To which Norma responds... I AM BIG its the picturh's that got small. and my favorite saying of all movies I have seen in life Norma's Desmonds swan song to the Camera's.<br /><br />"This is my life.  It always will be... There's no one else just us, the camera's and all those wonderful people out there in the dark..... Alright Mr DeMille I'm ready for my close up!".<br /><br />This is another of my must have DVD's.  Sunset Boulevard is serious in a weird way but in another way it is a solid black comedy laugh fest.  You have to buy Sunset Boulevard not to buy this is to cheat yourself of laughs galore.  Oh after seeing Sunset Bolevard you won't go swimming at any of Norma Desmonds Hollywood Parties unless you need to learn how to float.  I am sure if you are a young man willing to help write Norma a sure fire career reviving come back script she will gladly give you the crash course on floating in her pool.<br /><br />Play your cards right she might take you for a ride in her dusty old car.

An excellent introduction to S/A Music. Ladysmith Black Mambazo contributes two really nice tunes (their second selection is a real toe-tapper) acapella. There is a lovely instrumental featuring just guitars and congas and an equally sweet gospel song.

Should look amazing in HD. Yeah... it should. But it doesn't. In fact... I'm going to come out and say it looks bad,it is easily the worst looking high-definition title I've seen yet, and I've seen 30+ titles now. The image is muddy looking, lacking in crisp, clean detail. The colors don't quite pop off the screen like they should. This title should not have been released in Blu-ray format. Seriously, if you compare the upscaled Superbit standard-definition DVD to this, the Blu-ray Disc looks only marginally better. This should have been a reference title in high-def and it's not even in the ball park. My brow furrowed in troubled surprise at this point. Wow... and not the good kind.

When you think back on how dramatic the first episodes were when the space family Robinson got lost and crash landed on Priplanis, it is a shame to see that the show devolved into a situation comedy built around the scene stealing antics of Jonathan Harris as Dr. Smith.  This pair of episodes demonstrates him at his vainglorious best, which is arguably worse for the series.<br /><br />Episode 24, "His Majesty Smith" (Written by Carey Wilbur, First aired March 16, 1966) proves that every dog has his day as Dr. Smith becomes the leader of aliens on another world.  The cliffhanger from the previous episode had Dr. Smith finding a crown that he tries on only to get shocked.  When Will (Billy Mumy) dons the crown aliens show up and hail him as king.  Will refuses and Dr. Smith gets the job instead.  Of course there is a catch to this: the leader is sacrificed ever 10,000 years.  Notice that the alien ship looks a lot like the ship of the Keeper (ah, the joys of recycled sets on "Lost in Space").  However, Smith does get bonus points for actually doing something on his own behalf besides (and before) trying to run away.  Yes, there is a nice bit when the aliens make a Smith android that works hard (a dead give away) and there is also a nice punch line to this one that the aliens make sure they only sacrifice creatures that are not useful (but then why did they want Will?).  But there is no real pleasure in watching Smith being hung out to dry because it is all too silly.  Then there is the next episode...<br /><br />Episode 25, "The Space Croppers" (Written by Peter Packer, First aired March 30, 1966) offers the sight of Mercedes McCambridge as Sybilla, the matriarch of a group of space hillbillies that moves to Priplanis.  Dr. Smith tries wooing her because he sees an opportunity to a lift home while Don (Mark Goddard) falls for Sybilla's daughter, Effa (Sherry Jackson).  Meanwhile, the daughter turns out to be a witch, the son is a werewolf, the aliens are planting their crop of man-eating plants and once again it is up to the Robinsons to rescue Dr. Smith from another predicament.  Eventually this show would take us from the grand tradition in science fiction of Triffids to "The Great Vegetable Rebellion." If this is not the low point of the first season you are going to have to make an argument for what else the nadir could possible be.<br /><br />Again, the contrast to the first five stellar episodes of the series makes you want to cry and I am rounding up here only because of the scenes in the first episode where the Robinsons have to deal with the fact they really llike the android Dr. Smith.  Like a true situation comedy, you have a character (to wit, Dr. Smith) who refuses to learn anything from one week to the next.  In both of these episodes aliens take advantage of Smith, just like pretty much every other alien who has stopped by Priplanis, but that does not matter to Smith who makes the same mistakes over and over again.  The following season, when "Lost in Space" was up against the "Batman" phenomenon, things would get even worse in that respect, but at least they would be in color.
 | product/productId: 6300269426 | review/userId: A178M2RQGZBU9L | review/summary: One of Kubrick's best films. | review/text: I'm surprised by the number of people here who seem to be down on this film. I've noticed a number of reviews of Kubrick films in general that are displaying both a low opinion of his work, and a complete misunderstanding of it's nature. I suspect a lot of this is simply fallout from the videogame-action-film-influenced crop of people that do the bulk of movie consumption these days, who simply don't appreciate the meticulous and carefully considered film making that Kubrick did. Many films today are about 20% set acting and 80% special effects\post production, in Kubrick's time it was the opposite. That being said, this is one of those films often described as a "flawed masterpiece", but there's really nothing flawed about it. Kubrick was a director who put tremendous effort into creating what he thought a film should be, so there are few flaws in his films, unless you consider his vision itself to be flawed. I think Barry Lyndon is one of his most interesting efforts, and probably the most meticulously accurate period film made at the time. The lighting effects are amazing, as is the recreation of not only period settings, costumes, uniforms, but period language and attitudes, something a lot of films get very wrong. This disc will join 2001 and A Clockwork Orange in my collection as not only three of the best (in my opinion) films of all time, but three of the most significant.

But considering the 80s are the decade during which I graduated high school and college, and therefore was quite familiar with the odd way we dressed, wore our hair and socialized, this movie strikes a fond chord for me.<br /><br />Evoking those days might be painful, but this movie does it in such a light hearted way, that even memories of shallow posturing at shallow nightclubs is charming when seen through the eyes of these 3 aliens.<br /><br />I'd watch it for 3 scenes alone:<br /><br />1) We are HUMAN now!<br />2) Jeff Goldblum emerging from the tanning booth<br />3) The dance competition (hero/zero)

 | product/productId: 6302224322 | review/userId: A2FA18B50XGXJX | review/summary: Re-make with better model special effects | review/text: Several reviewers are right-on-target here about the virtue of this film is its use of actual Mosquito bombers. The point is that by sacrificing weight by going to all wood, the mosquito could fly very fast like a fighter (self-defense against enemy fighters) yet BOMB targets. Its was the world's first fighter-bomber by design. The rarity of flying footage is that the aircraft was DISPOSABLE by design and the glue that held these planes together has fallen apart over the years leaving us only one plane left in flying condition!<p>What I derive is that today we could today build in war-winning large quantities (can't do this with expensive F/A-18s, Harriers) an inexpensive disposible &quot;Mosquito&quot; attack plane using composites like Burt Rutan's ARES &quot;mudfighter&quot; and have it as either manned or unmanned to perform attack missions flying from dirt strips or grassy fields like the 633 Squadron does for better response to our ground troops.<p>We should re-edit this movie with 21st century Mosquito model effects and see if it stands up to its copy-cat Star Wars &quot;death star&quot; fighter-bomber sequence?

 | product/productId: 6300270696 | review/userId: A2XRZV63X79YSJ | review/summary: Great Date Film with some DVD flaws | review/text: Ladyhawke is a midevil fantasy.  Starcrossed lovers have been cursed to be together forever but apart forever.  From sunrise to sunset Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) is hawk.  While from sundown to sunrise, her beloved Navarre (Rutger Hauer) is a wolf.  Into their lives comes Philippe "the Mouse" Gaston (Matthew Broderick), a petty thief and escape artist.  Philippe has just escaped from prison and is being chased by the guard.  The same guard who Navarre used to be the Captain of the Guard.<br /><br />Navarre has returned to France to kill the Bishop (John Woods) who cursed Isabeau and himself.  But first he must get through is old command.  In the process, both he and hawk Isabeau are shot with arrows.  Philippe takes Isabeau to the priest Imperius (Leo McKern).  Imperius is the priest that betrayed the couple to the Bishop.  Imerius has been guilt ridden for this and has found a way for the couple to break the curse but Navarre is blinded by his rage and will not listen.<br /><br />Everything comes to a head at the Bishop's abbey.  Navarre confronts the Bishop but cannot kill him because of his love for Isabeau.  Then something fantastic happens, a day with night and a night without day or as we know it, an eclipse.  This allows both to appear in human form and confront the bishop.<br /><br />This was an early film in each of the stars careers.  Each had their breakthrough film and were looking for the next big film.  They achieved this with three great performances.  This film did not rely on a special effects but use simple dissolves and lighting.<br /><br />The only negative that I have with the DVD is that the musical score blares out and if you have the sound right for the music, you can't hear the actor.  If you have the sound right to hear the actors, the music will blast you out of your seat.  But this is more a warning and not a complaint.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None

 | product/productId: 6302413400 | review/userId: A1LSDATI53WWRX | review/summary: Great movie. | review/text: There are an amazing amount of action films these days.  Each one of them attempts to beat the last one's visual effects.  And in this competition, hollywood has lost track of what makes a truly great action film...  Skill.  Most of the action films these days are entirely uncreative, and many of them are very, very boring.  Who really want's to see a dozen tiles fall to the ground and break in slow motion, as films such as &quot;the Matrix&quot; use this technique constantly.  But this film is different.  It carries raw emotional power, and it's star, at age 50, did all of his own stunts, and even drove the locamotives that his character drives. This movie is awesome, and I highly recommend you buy this DvD.  And by the way, this music track is a lot of fun to listen to when you're sick.

The acting is way over the top and I was particulary inpressed with Natalie Portman that nails that trailer-trash character in the beginning and every stage in the evolution to come just as perfectly.<p>It would have been nice with some decent extras on this DVD, but the movie itself is worth every cent so I'm really not complaining. But still, the price is above average so one would expect a bit more than a few trailers/tv-spots and a music video...<p>Anyway, don't let this dissuade you from buying it! - Do it or you'll miss a small masterpiece!

 | product/productId: 630024993X | review/userId: A3KSPMD210TJPU | review/summary: Barbra Streisand's 1986 concert very inspiring!!! | review/text: The date: September 6, 1986. The setting: Barbra Streisand's backyard in Malibu. This concert was held by Barbra at her home. It was to raise money so that Democrats could take back control of the Senate and make things right for the nation, and face the issues that we were very frightened about back then. And yes, twenty years after this show, we seem to be facing these similar situations still. Barbra looked absolutely beautiful from beginning to end in this program. It never occurred to me (or anyone else) that this concert (and her other specials) would become available on DVD. Before this show came to DVD, people had to buy it in music format (LP, cassette, and CD). But now, it is here on DVD for fans of Barbra to enjoy. Barbra sings some of her most well loved songs, such as Evergreen, The Way We Were, People, and a number of others. Barry Gibb shows up later on and shares the stage with her to duet on Guilty and What Kind of Fool (here's a trivia tidbit for you: When Barbra was doing One Voice, it had been six years since she and Barry sang these two songs together--be sure to check out her startled reaction to Barry's voice while singing Guilty; that's funny). That was interesting. Before the show begins, Robin Williams gives the audience a comedy show (Camp Barbra). You also get responses from a few celebrities regarding Barbra doing this concert. Bette Midler, Henry Winkler, Whitney Houston, Sally Field, Sheena Easton, and Rep. Barbara Jordan give their positive thoughts regarding this evening and know that it would be an evening no one would forget. There are a couple of extra bonuses to this DVD:<br />1. You get a 2006 introduction by Barbra, in which she describes in retrospect that evening and her reason for holding the concert. She also discusses the issues that we're currently facing over twenty years later.<br />2. There is an audio invitation by her before the show (from '86, of course).<br />The audio and video quality on this DVD is so sharp and clear, you almost get the feeling that you've gone back in time to 1986 watching this program. A must have for any Barbra fan's collection. If you own One Voice on any one of the music formats (LP, tape, and/or CD), but don't yet have the DVD of it, what are you waiting for?
 | product/productId: 0767821785 | review/userId: AYG1U47VFZ165 | review/summary: Blu-ray GUNS OF NAVARONE Is A Must-See-Event! | review/text: Arguably one of the finest pictures to confront the effects of war on seasoned commandoes, THE GUNS OF NAVARONE celebrates its fiftieth anniversary release - finally new to Blu-ray - on October 18, 2011, and I was fortunate enough to receive an exclusive screener pre-release copy in order to complete this review.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Alistair MacLean, GUNS was adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman, the man also responsible for HIGH NOON and another seminal World War II picture, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  It was directed by J. Lee Thompson (a last minute but brilliant addition to the crew), and the film stars Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and David Niven, along with a host of additional faces familiar to this era of motion pictures.<br /><br />THE GUNS OF NAVARONE has always been one of my personal favorites, so I was excited to view this release on Blu-ray to see how the picture had endured the restoration process.  Much of the film looks amazing - there are a few notable sections of pronounced grain, and this is likely due to the condition of the aging negative as well as the fact that much of the film was shot in dark lighting - and the restored audio sounds terrific.  Also, Director Thompson deserves praise for his shot composition; throughout the picture, it's clear that he went to great lengths to position primary and secondary elements, bringing the story to life against a rigorous schedule of external and studio shooting.  As a consequence of his efforts, the film is nearly seamless; tremendous effort went into matching studio sets to their external lighting conditions.  I counted less than a handful of noticeable differences.  That, and when you listen to commentary and learn that, in some cases, location shooting was done weeks if not months before matching studio shots were completed, it becomes clear that Thompson's attention to detail was quite probably unmatched for its time.  Yes, the picture is simply that superior.<br /><br />Historically, THE GUNS OF NAVARONE presented audiences with a bit of a departure from the usual war picture of its time.  Television had taken hold of the global consciousness, and motion picture studios were finding it increasingly difficult to create an audience for films, especially within the United States.  For that reason alone, producer and screenwriter Carl Foreman opted to produce GUNS - his first film after coming off the Hollywood Blacklist, a roughly ten year expulsion from the industry for refusing to participate with the House Un-American Activities Committee - with a greater international flair.  Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn were at the height of their careers, with each actor drawing huge influences from their respective country of association.  This `mix' of global influences gave GUNS the chance to speak more directly to the personal cost of war while lessening the usual `nationalist' approach of trumpeting one country's role in World War II.  Instead, these commandoes brought their own respective `baggage' to the crack team assigned to destroy an impregnable Nazi base featuring two long-range guns wrecking havoc on Allied ships near the fictional island of Navarone.<br /><br />And what baggage it is!  Gregory Peck - as Captain Keith Mallory - has grown weary of the war and of the responsibilities of command.  David Niven - as Cpl. Miller - has grown ever more cynical with military leadership, instead choosing to align himself only under officers he personally approves of.  Anthony Quinn - as Col. Andrea Stavros - has lost his family to the conflict, and he passes the days waiting for the war to end so that he can exact his vengeance on the man he blames for the death of his loved ones (Peck's Capt. Mallory).  Stanley Baker - as Pvt. `Butcher' Brown - has grown so tired of his trademark killing that he can hardly bear to kill in cold blood any longer.  And James Darren - as Pvt. Spyros Pappadimos - has become a killing machine, living his life in wait for the chance to release his bloodlust on an unsuspecting enemy.<br /><br />These men are not the typical soldiers featured in the standard war picture of the time - they follow orders with a certain extent of professional reluctance, willing to accept their responsibilities only when the moment requires it.  Along the way, however, they're torn between moments of faith and faithlessness in accomplishing their perilous mission, and they're equally torn with accepting one another's guidance, counsel, and command unless and until the mission demands it of them.  They're patriots, but, thanks to some savvy writing and expert direction, they have to prove it not only to themselves but also to one another.<br /><br />THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is loaded with exceptional special features, several of which are appearing for the first time with this Blu-ray release.  The disc features two commentary tracks - one by film historian Stephen J. Rubin, and one from director J. Lee Thompson.  Rubin's track is ripe with fascinating tidbits and trivia associated to the film's history including pre-production and scripting elements as well as a very useful rundown on cast and crew.  Thompson's track - by contrast - is largely economical; he recalls some personal experiences in working with the principles, and he gravitates toward explaining some differences between location filming and studio production.  All-in-all, both are solid, but I was more interested in Rubin's assessment.  The disc also features "A Message from Carl Foreman," which is a filmed greeting from the producer which played to audiences at the Sydney, Australia premiere of the picture.  Several featurettes are also available.  "Epic Restoration" runs about 10 minutes, and it deals with the restoration efforts that took place to the film in 2006.  "A Heroic Score" runs about 10 minutes, is dated from the 2006 release of the film on DVD, and basically explores Dimitri Tiomkin's efforts to score the picture.  Lastly, the featurettes include four newsreel-style productions - all dated from 1961 but showing copyrights of 2011, so I believe this is the first time they've been included with a release; these include "Great Guns" (a look at the two guns of the adventure), "No Visitors" (a visit to the set of the film), "Honeymoon on Rhodes" (James Darren and his wife of three weeks celebrated their honeymoon while he was filming GUNS), and "Two Girls on the Town" (a tongue-in-cheek shopping trip to Greek shops by the film's two female leads, Irene Papas and Gia Scala).<br /><br />More in-depth documentaries provided on the disk include: "Forging the Guns of Navarone: Notes from the Set" runs about 15 minutes, and it gives a basic rundown of the major challenges to making `the biggest B feature ever made,' including its 6 world premieres.  "An Ironic Epic of Heroism" runs about 25 minutes, and it addresses how the filmmakers set out to essentially craft a modern day Greek `epic,' not dissimilar to "The Iliad" or "The Odyssey."  Also, "Memories of Navarone" runs about 30 minutes, and it deals with the various memories of Peck, Quinn, Thompson, and Darren.<br /><br />Exclusive to the Blu-ray release is "The Resistance Dossier of Navarone," which combines photographs, text notes, and inserted videographies specifically created for this 50th anniversary release.  "Military Fact or Fiction" reviews the basic plotline of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, explains that the picture isn't truly based on any single place or event, and provides clarity on matters of `the British experience' as well as the extensive weaponry featured in the picture.  "The Greek Resistance" explores the unique role that Greeks and the Greek islands played in World War II - their geographical significance to the Mediterranean - and provides some fascinating anecdotes on Greek resistance fighters.  "The Navarone Effect" expands upon what the studio wanted with the motion picture, showing how it truly became a major influence in war pictures that followed, and also investigates the film's message on how peace should be equally as important as conflict.  "The Old School Wizardry of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE" reveals how the film's special effects were a composite of `old school' and `new school' film magic; indeed, GUNS won an Oscar for its effects work in 1961.  "The Real World Guns of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE" examines the twin cannons of the film's plot and explores their basis in reality.  Lastly, "World War II in the Greek Islands" presents a basic history primer on Greece's strategic importance to both the Axis and the Allied Powers.<br /><br />If anything, what genuinely impressed me with this new viewing of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is how sparse the dialogue is for an action picture.  The actors are top notch, communicating precisely what needs communicating with a wink or a feverish glance or a nod, and, to his credit, director Thompson let this talented cast loose to play in this world that Alistair MacLean created.  It's a masterful job throughout.  If the film suffers any faults, it's quite possibly that several sequences stretch on a bit longer than they need to; interestingly enough, director Thompson reflects on several occasions - in his own commentary - that, were he making the picture for today's audiences, he definitely would've trimmed a few action sections so that the narrative was pushed forward more quickly.  Despite that failing, GUNS remains a definitive action picture - sharply drawn and vivid characters thrust into a virtual no-win scenario where only men and women at the top of their form emerge victorious.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, do so today.  If you have seen it, don't be afraid to experience it all brand new on Blu-ray.  You'll be amply rewarded!

Underrated Plot. | review/text: This movie is a perfect &quot;intelligent&quot; action/suspense thriller.  The car chases are probably the best ever filmed; they surpass those in Bullit by the same director, and they are not even the best part of the  film, just a bonus!  The plot is not &quot;thready&quot; by any means, as  it was dubbed by many critics, rather it is intracately designed for the  alert viewer to spot various clues and keep them guessing until the end.  The action is incomparble for this type of film.  Beyond the filmic  elements, this sort of subject matter is appealing to many, as well as the  beautiful locations of France.  Above all this is the smart man's action  film.  I would not be without it in my DVD library. Possibly one of the ten  or fifteen best films of 1998, it is that enjoyable!
 | product/productId: 6302253055 | review/userId: AIMR915K4YCN | review/summary: Crazy Cannibal Clan Cause Catastrophic Campout... | review/text: The Carter family are on their way to a silver mine, under the guidance of patriarch / retired-cop "Big Bob" Carter. This is his idea of a vacation. Well, he drives them into the desert, only to get lost and run off the road. The car undrivable, The Carter's are stuck in the middle of a wasteland. Thay have a trailer full of food and drink, two german shepherds (named Beauty and Beast), two pistols, ammo, and there are seven Carters (including a baby). They'd be just fine if it weren't for the family of cannibals preparing to swoop down and wipe them out! THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a survivalist nightmare, loaded with creeping dread. The Jupiter clan is small but deadly. They are extremely vicious and conditioned to steal, kill, and eat to stay alive. The Carters are typical american suburbanites on a holiday; soft, civilized, and totally  unaware of danger. When these two families meet, it appears to be no contest, as the Carters begin dropping like blowflies. Papa Jupiter (James Whitworth), and his family (including Michael Berryman in the role that made him infamous as Pluto) see the Carters as their next big feast. However, once the murder and mayhem have taken their toll, the remnant of the Carters strike back, in ways that are equal to, if not more extreme than the evil they've endured. Even Beast goes on a rampage after Beauty is killed. The heroic canine offs two of the horrific hayseeds all by himself! The tables definitely turn in surprising ways. This movie was made way back when Wes Craven was scary. It's terror lies in the fact that it is believable. Both families seem real. Check out Dee Wallace (E.T., The Howling, Cujo, Critters) as the oldest Carter daughter. Highly recommended...

 | product/productId: 0792837096 | review/userId: AUTJ2SVH14IHW | review/summary: Still Hot | review/text: The all-time outrageous, satirical, crossdressing extravaganza, Some Like It Hot is one of the most hilarious, raucous films ever made. The ribald film is a clever combination of many elements: a spoof of 1920-30's gangster films and romance in a screwball comedy with one central joke - entangled and deceptive identities, reversed sex roles and cross-dressing.<p>When Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) accidentally witness the infamous St Valentine's Day massacre, they decide to flee Chicago but the only ticket out of town for two broke musicians is a gig in Miami, Florida. There's just one catch: it's an all-girl band. So Joe and Jerry board a southbound train to Florida disguised as Josephine and Daphne. Their cover is perfect until a lovelorn singer falls for "Josephine", an ancient playboy falls for Daphne, and a mob boss refuses to fall for their hoax.<p>They become fast friends with the band's most trouble-prone member, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) whose dream is to meet a millionaire in Florida and live the good life. The film follows both Curtis and Lemmon as they try to simultaneously hide the fact that they are in drag, whilst practicing cruel deceptions -Curtis has Monroe thinking she's met a millionaire, and millionaire Joe. E. Brown thinks Lemmon is a woman. This comedy is a movie that's about nothing but sex and yet pretends it's about crime and greed. Curtis lusts for Monroe and disguises himself as a millionaire to win her. Monroe lusts after money and gives him lessons in love. Their relationship is flipped and mirrored in low comedy as Lemmon gets engaged to a real millionaire, played by Joe E. Brown. Wilder's gender-bending and risqu&eacute; comedy, is filled with sly sexual innuendo, parodies of sexual stereotypes, sexy costuming for the well-endowed, bosomy Marilyn Monroe, an outrageous and steamy seduction scene aboard a yacht, and a mix of serious themes including abuse, alcoholism, unemployment, and murder among others.<p>The non-stop action, slapstick and reminiscent one-liners encouraged critics and movie goers alike to compare Widler's film to Marx Brothers classics, especially in the slapstick chases as gangsters pursue the heroes through hotel corridors.
 | product/productId: 6302296900 | review/userId: A225XUV3QMQIHB | review/summary: Such a pitty... | review/text: I must say, I don't think I've ever been so dissapointed by a movie before. I wanted to get this so much simply because I loved the first. The plot, is a basic clone of the first but with two creatures in it. That's not what is so sad about this, but that everything good in the first has been traded for crap.<br /><br />The acting, is horrid. I've seen better dialogue in 1970s low-budget monster movies like "MONSTER". What really makes this a pitty is the creatures. Yea, the one may have regenerated from a finger, but aside from that, the regeneration is gone. The creature's designs are so badly changed that they seem more like zombies, at least in the original, it actually LOOKED like a monster.<br /><br />The characters, who really cares about them? They had NO back story except for the main returning character (who also directed and can be blamed for this "horror").<br /><br />Sure, the original was an "ALIEN" rip-off, but a GOOD "ALIEN" rip-off, this is just a bad movie. AVOID.
 | product/productId: 6301562941 | review/userId: AQP1VPK16SVWM | review/summary: A well crafted, but flawed science fiction classic | review/text: Cameron had to cut an additional twenty minutes from the finished film due to his &quot;final cut&quot; contract with Fox. The result made a film that had interesting characters and moral complexity considerably weaker and  less interesting.<p>With the footage added to the VHS edition (it is  similiar to the laserdisc edition issued a  couple of years back), the film  actually becomes a richer, more consistent and rewarding experience. The  additonal footage adds clarity to the plot and also makes the characters  more interesting. <p>The plot becomes a little predictable and run of the  mill by the end, but it doesn't make this flawed classic any less  compelling...just a little disappointing in the end. Although Cameron tends  to create films that run on a little too long, usually its justified by the  action and additional shadings added to the characters.<p>Although shot on  Super 70 (one of the first films to use this format to its advantage)so  that the cropped version doesn't suffer as much from the grain problems of  most video transfers, the wide screen version adds to the epic elements  that make this such a watchable film.<p>Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 0790731932 | review/userId: A2MP1SXOBLPQMQ | review/summary: The Wildest Ride Ever | review/text: If you want car chases and spectacular action scenes, then the Road Warrior is it.  Set in a post-apocalyptic desert world, it's about a drifter (played by Mel Gibson) who comes across a besieged group of refugees who are surrounded by a gang of thugs intent on taking their prized possession.  And what is that?  A functioning oil rig.  The drama and fight scenes set a new standard for action and adventure movies.<br /><br />Gibson's character must decide what to do.  Join them or go on his way?  He's a loner by nature, but can he survive alone out there?  This is one of the great films of the 1980s.  The sequel to Mad Max, it can stand by itself (you don't need to see Mad Max first to understand it).  This is the wildest ride on film.

Finally, I bought it around the holiday season, but didn't have much time to watch it. About a week ago I popped it in, expecting a good film, but what I got was something different. To say that it is a good film is an insult to what this film is. And that is amazing. A truly great film, both sad and yet enjoyable. The ending will stick with you hours after watching, because it is just so groundbreaking. Watch this film.
 | product/productId: 6302152429 | review/userId: AXKK6BFHMHD2R | review/summary: Great , late era giallo | review/text: First of all, the reviewer who gave this dvd release a single star is retarded. Many of the actors actually spoke english for the film, twit! You obviously have no idea about the history of giallo, nor the history of the european film industry in general at that time...sheesh! I may be overreacting but 1 star is just ridiculous! Rate the FILM for what it is! NOT FOR WHAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE!!!!<br /><br />OK, deep breath.....the dvd is of good quality. I think it might actually look better than AnchorBays release. I already have the two-disc A-B version, but watch this blue-underground disc more for that very reason.<br /><br />I wont go into what the film is about as other reviewers already have, i'll just say that it is an above average giallo, an underrated giallo. The acting is way, way above average for this genre! Also, it has some of Argentos most memorable set-piece killings and is saturatted with his style. This is the last GREAT Argento film, imho. He faded a little after this and never really captured his earlier genius.<br /><br />Great buy. Not one star but a solid 4 star effort by Argento and this dvd is well worth the price.
 | product/productId: 0783226039 | review/userId: A3V6Z4RCDGRC44 | review/summary: A Must-See | review/text: I adore Spartacus. The Spartacus character was a real life, historical figure, and we are hearing about the real, poignant struggles of an abused group. While the movie Spartacus wasn't on the first AFI listings, it did get voted onto the 10th anniversary version, earning the #81 spot.<br /><br />Kirk Douglas shines as the main character. He goes from a slave to a gladiator, and quickly to the leader of the slave revolt. Along the way he could have become harsh towards nobles, but instead he shows a humanity. He wants their movement to be better than what they are escaping from. He refuses to brutalize Simmons, even when she is offered to him as a prostitute. Instead, he falls in love with her, and of course in true movie-like fashion they end up together.<br /><br />On one hand the movie does a great job of showing the epic scope of the conflict. There are a wide range of slaves escaping - from pampered house slaves to grizzled field workers. You are shown a sad scene of a quiet slave couple having to bury their newborn infant. And yet, with all of the characters, and all of the scenes, from rich mansions to poor hovels, somehow it is only men who are talking. Simmons occasionally talks to Spartacus, to support him. There are two noble women who show up briefly, but their only purpose is to coo at the gladiators and make it clear how heartless many of the nobles are about forcing others to die. It would have been much more moving to show how this revolt truly affected all people, and how all were doing their part. Instead we get a granny as "comic relief" when she offers to help the cause.<br /><br />Still, there is great cinematography of the Italian landscapes, and intriguing dialogue that explores the world the nobles inhabited and how much it differed from the world of the slaves and gladiators. The nobles scoff at even the idea that slaves could cause a threat to their forces. The soldiers are laughing and drinking on their way down to squish the slaves. They aren't laughing quite as strongly after that first encounter.<br /><br />Highly recommended. There were many epics made throughout the history of movies, but this one stands out for its fine acting, its powerful story, and the ending scene where the slaves show their true moral character.
 | product/productId: 6301928369 | review/userId: A38CKJ7C1K71JF | review/summary: Great action movie. don't waste your brain cells on the plot, there  isn't much of one | review/text: 1989 martial arts movie set in Thailand and focusing on the somewhat brutal sport of Muay Thai,the national sport of Thailand, which has gained wider recognition in the West because it's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts. Jean-Claude Van Damme is no great actor, but it's a good action movie for all that. In the movie, Van Damme is Kurt Sloane, brother of Eric (Dennis Alexio), the top kickboxer in the United States. Tiring of the generic competition of his native soil, he travels with brother Kurt to Bangkok, where he hopes to dethrone the current champ Tong Po (Michel Qissi), who has a reputation for fighting dirty. Kurt first sees this towering mountain of flesh and muscle kicking the hell out of a support beam in the locker room; that's the first clue to Kurt that Eric shouldn't get in the ring, but he's not listening. And Eric fights anyway, against baby brother's warnings.<br /><br />To make a long story short, Eric takes quite a beating in the ring but a series of illegal blows delivered after Kurt throws in the towel cripple Eric for life. So what went wrong? According to some sources, American Kickboxing is a watered-down form of Muay Thai, so it's no wonder Tong Po got the upper hand so quickly on Eric, who despite his excellent training and peak physical condition, only landed a few lucky punches on the towering fighter. Apparently, Muay Thai is strictly for street fighting, not something for refined martial artists like Kurt and Eric. To teach Tong Po a lesson in humility, Kurt contacts American Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) to seek out a venerated Thai master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), to learn the art of Muay Thai, and so the training begins. Kurt first puts aside his already-planted Karate training and strengthens his body, kicks tree stumps until the scar tissue prevents any kind of feeling aside from invincibility, learns a little about Asian spirituality, and even flirts with Chow's niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). What it all culminates in, of course, is a no-holds-barred "Rocky IV"-style showdown using the ancient rope-fists between Kurt and Tong Po.<br /><br />As Kurt Sloane, Van Damme is good (despite his acting limitations), his performance notwithstanding, and none of the other performers are really worth speaking of either, but Tong Po is a nasty villain and his one speaking line "You bleed like Mylee. Mylee good f**k" sends chills down the spine. The fights are another thing and are what this feature co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth seems to specialize in. The fights are spectacular (as with any martial arts movie that features Van Damme doing his trademark splits and 360-degree flying spin-kick), which does include one sequence where Kurt gets drunk, starts dancing, and takes on the patrons at a bar. Just don't let the film "kick" you in the head too much with its lackadaisical script and lame-brain plotting.<br /><br />As an aside, I was in Thailand when they were filming this movie - one scene was filmed in the street I was staying in in Bangkok - saw the whole scene being filmed from the bar in which I was ensconced, had no idea what it was or who the muscle bound actor was until I saw the movie a couple of years later. And then it dawned on me like a wet fish to the side of the head - I'd spent a whole day a mere 50 feet from Jean-Claude. And I didn't get a single Singha bottle autographed!
 | product/productId: 0792838556 | review/userId: A30Q8X8B1S3GGT | review/summary: The DUKE rides again! | review/text: A wonderful picture of the war between the states, &quot;Horse Soldiers&quot; follows the story of Wayne leading his troopers in an attack deep into enemy territory. Loosely based on a factual event, the Union must cut off the supply lines to Vicksburg. DUKE leads the raid.<p>This is a fantastic transfer, as others have mentioned. I spotted literally one damaged frame, with a &quot;V&quot; shaped crease in it. The colors blaze off the screeen, and although there are no booklets, inserts, or extras (other than the original trailer), the disc is a real keeper.<p>Although many see this picture as &quot;Ford-lite,&quot; there are several classic Ford touches throughout the film. The opening shot of the calvary marching in a sundown silhouette is stirring. The charge of the child soldiers is a great moment (you see Wayne tip his hat to them as he rides off). <p>For me, I like the subtle, &quot;hidden&quot; Ford touches in all of his films, which reveal telling information about characters without the overbearing, in-your-face, and just plain heavy-handed direction in today's movies.<p>In &quot;Horse Soldiers&quot;, the dyed-in-the-wool Southern patriot Hannah Hunter has spent several days as prisoner of the Union soldiers. At one point, in order to make her feel better, a soldier gives her a candle for light. Another offers her a fragment of a looking glass. The soldier holds up the broken mirror, and when she looks at her reflection she can see the soldier's Yankee cap over the top of it, as if she wore it herself. That's Ford telling us she's been converted, without slapping us in the face or dumbing it down for us.<p>You'll see familiar Ford faces pop up here and there, too. Jack Pennick is in just about all of John Ford's westerns. Hank Worden and Ken Curtis will be instantly familiar to fans of &quot;The Searchers&quot;. Ken Curtis was also in &quot;Rio Grande&quot; and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, and is probably best known as Festus on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. <p>O.Z. Whitehead was in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;. Walter Reed was in &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; and &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;.<p>Bing Russell, who plays Dunker, is the man gunned down in the saloon in another DUKE movie, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;.<p>Of couse, other familiar faces include Storther Martin and Denver Pyle as a pair of Confederate deserters.<p>This is a really solid cavalry film, with The DUKE in the thick of the action. William Holden is a good match as a foil for DUKE.<p>For those who say DUKE couldn't act, DUKE has a great scene in the Newton Station bar when he reveals why he doesn't like doctors.<p>&quot;Horse Soldiers&quot; is an overlooked gem from Ford, only because his more famous films shine that much more.

I used to watch this movie when I was younger and loved it, so I thought I'd give it another try. This movie was almost as good as I remembered. It is in the same vein as the other Don Bluth films, including All Dogs Go to Heaven, and is just a cute little movie that is really not well known. I heard that it has been discontinued, so if you stumble upon a copy like I did I recommend you snap it up quick (if you like that type of film). The animation is cute and the songs are kind of catchy. It doesn't have too many famous voices (except Phil Harris) but the voice acting is done very well. I plan on sharing this movie with my kids, both because it is enjoyable and because it shows how friends and confidence in yourself are important. Don't expect a masterpiece, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

 | product/productId: 0790729725 | review/userId: A2EEZIKZ7SAW5E | review/summary: Good Fellas - Blu Ray | review/text: I wont bother reviewing the movie itself. It has to stand as one of the 100 best films of all time (at least in my list). As far as Blu Ray goes, this is much improved over my original "flipper" 2-sided DVD version. Some reviewers have mentioned the grain in some parts of the film. That's just the stock they made the transfer from. There is another part where there is a vertical line in the scene through De Niro that is part of the negative. But when the film is sharp, the transfer is perfect. I think this is especially obvious at the very beginning of the movie when there is tight close-up of a young Henry Hill looking out the window of his apartment and you can see the details of what looks like a green contact lens (to match Liotta I suppose).<br />I was disappointed by the audio. It seemes a bit muddy. I need to go back to my "flipper" version to see if it was any better. This may be a case of trying to make Dolby 5.1 out of an old soundtrack.<br />Overall, Certainly worth the price. Worth replacing an older version (not sure if this applies to the newer "collecters edition" or not.<br />By the way, one fun part of watching this movie is picking out all the Soprano's characters that were in this film. Christoper, Pauli, "Old" Carmine (Tony Lipp plays "Tony the Wop" or something like that), I think even "Big Pussy", Vincent Pastore has a walk on bit. For "The Wire" fans, I noticed that Isiah Whitlock Jr (the "honorable" Sen Clay Davis) had a bit part playing a Dr when Henry is picking his wheelchair bound brother up from the hospital near the end of the film.

Spawning several sequels, "American Pie" is simply a well-acted and funny film that all audiences will enjoy. The plot involves four teenagers attempting to lose their virginity before highschool graduation. The title refers to the fact that having sex actually feels like "apple pie": once you view the film you'll know more. Seanne William Scott, who plays the supporting role of Stifler, steals the film with his cuteness and brave acting chomps, and he would go on to actually star in other "American pie" films. The DVD is loaded with bonuses including on-location interviews, commentary, trailers, and more. There is also an informative booklet that accompanies the set. A perfect film to view on a Friday night!
 | product/productId: 6302477786 | review/userId: A1PASRZ81DY9C | review/summary: A Time Capsule of Television History. | review/text: Back then, The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the biggest things ever on television, and for a good reason, because it's where many of the most famous performers in the world have appeared. Also, Ed Sullivan made sure that they would be granted an access on his show because he knew they would be big before they got big. Most importantly, Ed Sullivan was truly the Master of Ceremonies, long before there were Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, and others. Two of the most important moments in television history occurred on The Ed Sullivan Show were the introduction of Elvis Presley (which was "viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 82.6 percent of the television audience, and the largest single audience in television history") and the Beatles to Americans. Another unique aspect of his show was the zero discrimination given to black performers and performers of different stages including ballet, opera, theatrical plays, vaudeville, puppet shows, etc. That's what made Ed Sullivan a huge humanitarian and possibly the most important of the show business. Of course, Ed Sullivan was not without controversies, many of them famous and well-known. He was a strict disciplinarian, having a say-so on what can happen and not on his show. Regardless, he did more for many than not. Looking at the Vol. One of VHS tape, although it has the moments taped, it also had a lot of bland, outdated, or corny stuff. Sometimes, there were a few who were overdid once too many times (perhaps favoritism?). All in all, no matter what, the VHS tape brings back great memories of The Ed Sullivan Show.

Rumble Fish is one of them.  It was a perfect role for Dillon who works with Rourke and Hopper in an amazingly trippy mood-fest!!  The way Coppola filmed this one is rather unique and amazing - far from reality.  But if you've been where the characters have been in real life, the method makes sense.  You don't have to live it to feel it - because I know of straight, white-collar folks who have appreciated the complexity - BUT it helps to have been there.  Congratulations to Coppola for creating a stylish, timeless treasure that movie fans are only now beginning to appreciate.  For those who love to critique movies based on the norm and logic: pick this one up, sit back and let go for awhile.

The story as fiction is compelling to the last sentence. That it is framed in a context of the real events of the times brings unignorable history to the view of readers now three generations later.<br /><br />Dealving into the incredible chemistry that makes the middle east an emotional as well as a physical time bomb, it is not too difficult to separate fact from fiction and in the telling of this story, the two do not conflict. The story is true, only the names were changed. This is a story for the ages; a struggle of unbelievable strength and courage.<br /><br />This is one of the few books i know i will read again, and perhaps again.

I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences.
 | product/productId: 6300183157 | review/userId: AO58JI1G7JSKC | review/summary: Clunky '60s dialogue and music | review/text: I read many reviews of this 1968 Don Siegal opus and all were enthusiastic.  I like Dirty Harry from Siegal, but was extrememely disappointed with this film.  It feels like a pilot for Sunday Mystery Movie (of course the nudity in one of the first scenes ruled that out), and it never got better.  The parallel stories of detecitve Richard Widmark trying to find a criminal who had made him look the fool, and the moral dilemnas faced by Henry Fond (the police commissioner) never come together.  In fact, I never understood why these two characters were in the same film.  In one scene where they meet at a black tie social affar, the dialogue and acting between the two are so uncomfortable, I actually laughed out loud.  In fact, that is my big gripe with the whole movie.  There seems to be so much unmotivated conflict and unexplained resolution, I was left, at best, confused.  Why Henry Fonda lets one of his best friends off the hook after he learns he is "on the take" is unresolved.  Why Madigan has such a temptestuous relationship with his wife (Inger Stevens) is likewise unmotivated.  I just felt the scriptwriters had two or three story lines and strung them together.  I know life is filled with many parallel stories and events.  These just don't seem to have anything to do with each other.  And if that weren't enough, Don Costa's bombastic score constantly calls attention to itself, actually distracting me from the movie.  All in all, my wife and I were left flat and we did not care about any of these characters, even after the surprise ending.

 | product/productId: 0780625064 | review/userId: A219CBDNLGGH88 | review/summary: One of the better sequels | review/text: Sequels are often lame imitations of the original, but City Slickers 2 keeps the atmosphere and much of the chemistry of City Slickers 1.  The acting is excellent, especially Jack Palance (as usual).  The "Indiana Jones" mine ride is a bit corny, but after all, the storyline is a fantasy anyway!  If you enjoyed the first one, you will like City Slickers 2.  The video and sound quality on this sequel is somewhat superior to the first one.

 | product/productId: 6302478146 | review/userId: A18RQ2URRGIIEA | review/summary: Not One of Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's Best Supermarionations | review/text: Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's grand finale for their wonderful series of supermarionated shows & films about a family that has dedicated itself to rescuing/assisting others who are in trouble, the Tracy's, who are better known as the Thunderbirds, was a bit of a disappointment.  Filmed in 1968, the final installment of the Thunderbirds entitled "Thunderbird 6" gave the impression that a new and wonderful craft was going to be unveiled and put to use in a horrific rescue attempt.  All of the previous Thunderbird shows & films had a total of five ships that the Tracy family members used: Thunderbird 1 (essentially a rocket), Thunderbird 2 (a lifting body aircraft), Thunderbird 3 (a space-going rocket), Thunderbird 4 (a submarine) and Thunderbird 5 (an orbiting satellite).  At the beginning of "Thunderbird 6", Brains (voice of David Graham), the man who designed all of the Thunderbird ships, presents an idea to a private aircraft corporation to build an airship.  After being laughed at by the company's board of directors, they build the airship anyway because it is powered not by bags of hot air or lighter-than-air gas, but by a highly sophisticated anti-gravity device.  Shortly thereafter, the Tracy family patriarch, John Tracy (voice of Keith Alexander), asks Brains to design a new Thunderbird ship to be called Thunderbird 6.  Unfortunately, Brains' initial design is rejected and spends much of the rest of the film being upset as he tries to design something better.  In the meantime, Alan Tracy (voice Mark Zimmerman), Tin Tin (voice of Christine Finn), Lady Penelope (voice of Sylvia Anderson) and her chauffer named Parker (voice of David Graham again), take an extended first "cruise" aboard the airship that Brains designed for the private aircraft corporation.  However, unknown to them, spies have replaced the airship's crew.<br /><br />The reason, then, why "Thunderbird 6" was rather disappointing is that most of the film (at least 2/3 of it) focuses upon the lengthy cruise across the globe that the airship takes.  It is only in the last third of the film that any exciting action emerges with the Thunderbirds, but there were a few unusual camera angles used towards the beginning of the film that had not been used in previous Thunderbirds episodes.  Sadly, due to the film's lack of audience engagement through most of the film and less realistic rescue during the final third of the film, I can only rate "Thunderbird 6" with 3 out of 5 stars. One interesting aspect to "Thunderbird 6" that is worth noting was that it used more live action footage than any previous Thunderbird installment (most of the biplane scenes were an actual biplane in flight).  For it was only one year later (1969) that Gerry & Sylvia Anderson embarked on their first live-action sci-fi TV series, which was entitled "UFO".  A few years later, this show was re-imagined into the better-known sci-fi TV series entitled "Space: 1999".  It is possible, then, that Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's interest in supermarionation as a means of conveying their sci-fi story ideas was already beginning to fade in favor of live-action when they were developing the story for "Thunderbird 6" because its similarity to a soap-opera was very much part of the character development used in the live-action "UFO" TV series that aired only one year later.

Each action that takes them further into danger is a logical progression.

 | product/productId: 6302280354 | review/userId: ANLEL1J3ZS8YP | review/summary: Produced by Dario Argento | review/text: Many times a movie is criticized for having bad actors. This is not one of those movies. The actors actually are not bad. Where this movie goes wrong is in the actual script for the storyline and the production by Dario Argento. The actors did the best that anyone else could have done with a far fetched script that was actually silly more than scary or at least suspenseful. The main characters did show emotional range and good acting ability.<br />So, what should a potential buyer be forewarned about? Here is a short list of production flaws in this movie:<br />1-horrible 80's organ music from a cheap casio keyboard. If music is included in a horror movie to build suspense, the music should be gothic and atmospheric, not sesame street level toddler piano. The bad music is distracting from noticing the main actors of the video.<br />2-poor special effects-one scene has a sesame street looking monstor with glowing red eyes-very poorly done.<br />3-Some of the scenes did not match with the rest of the movie. Too much time was wasted on camera shots or conversations with non-essential characters who just appeared at various parts of the film who had no real impact on the movie.<br />On the other hand, there is a demon sex scene-it is filmed from a side angle and from a distance. So, don't expect to see any details in that scene either.<br />This is an example of a movie that actually has some talented actors, but, had a well known producer who did a poor job co-writting and producing this movie. My feeling is that Dario Argento rushed to write the script for this movie and really did not apply himself to at least make a believable horror film like he did with some of his other classics.<br />Unless you are an extremme fan of Dario Argento, stay away from this silliness. In fact, I would not recommend that anyone watch this video for free on cable. My rating for this video is 1 star<br />Very poor script writing that limited the actors ability to perform-
 | product/productId: 0800173465 | review/userId: A280GY5UVUS2QH | review/summary: Best Foreign Film 1970 | review/text: What makes the film so memorable is its almost dreamlike atmosphere. The Finzi-Contini's garden is a many acred forest replete with wooded paths and tennis court where time seems to stand still as in an Italian pastoral painting. The family is wealthy and influential and so though Jewish remains at a comfortable remove from those events effecting most Italian Jews. The children of the Finzi-Continis are the effeminate, withdrawn and sickly Alberto and the beautiful and artistic and tempermental but emotionally cold Micol(Dominique Sanda). Micol seems to intuit the coming events before they happen and that explains why she refuses any intimate connection. Her love from youth is Grigorio but she wants nothing to do with real emotions from which she knows nothing can come. over Grigorio she chooses intimacies that demand nothing from her emotionally. In one particularly poignant scene Grigorio spies her through a window after she has been making love and she aware of his gaze shamelessly refuses to try and hide the fact as if conveying to him their mutual sense of helplessness. Micol knows what is to come but powerless to do anything about it she retreats into herself further and further. The garden is equated with Micol, symbolizing her sense of beauty, love of art, and culture itself. The gardens isolated quiet surrounded by walls merely emphasizes Micols passive nature in the face of events that will devestate everything about life that she values. DeSica keeps the pace of his film a deliberately slow one and rarely shows you the events happening outside the small Finzi-Contini circle except in brief glimpses of newsreel footage seen in movie theatres so that when the final events unfold they are all the more shocking even though they have been expected all along. And when the Black Shirts do come round to collect all Jews the Finzi-Continis are dressed and waiting. A very moving film for its subtlely crafted and quiet depiction of civilization being undermined by brutal  forces. Dominique Sanda is beautiful and fascinatingly complex. Her scenes reward repeat viewings, she is an actress with an uncommon ability to convey deep stirrings of the soul without words.<br />Also out in 1970 were Bertolucci's Conformist and Fellinis Satyricon. Viva Italia!

 | product/productId: 6300269701 | review/userId: A3KT7AIRK3UYNL | review/summary: My Number One All-Time Favorite Movie | review/text: As a previous reviewer mentioned, this movie repays repeated viewings, which is quite a goal for a three hour film.  When you do, watch for all of the multiple roles that most of the actors play (even Malcolm McDowell plays a different character in the black & white film that runs at the beginning).  One of my favorite aspects of the film is Alan Price's soundtrack.  The songs (which relate very well to the action in the movie) are not only played in a studio by the Alan Price combo throughout the story, the band is actually part of the plot!!  The director's cameo at the end of the film is one of the most clever in the history of cinema.  And I would be very remiss if I did not mention the extremely lovely Helen Mirren in one of her early film roles.  My thirty-plus year-old crush on Ms. Mirren started with this movie.
 | product/productId: 6301967836 | review/userId: A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA | review/summary: Perfect Holiday Classic for Scrooge Lovers | review/text: A most worthy film to have in your essential classic holiday collection. Anyone who is a die-hard Scrooge-ophile should already have this. If you only like modern holiday tales, I'm not sure whether you'd like it. The acting, and production is very oldtime, so those who long for Christmas Past would enjoy this.<br /><br />The MGM, 1938 version is one of the best Scrooge films, coming from a traditional holiday buff. The ones I have so far are: Scrooge (1935), Christmas Carol (1951), Scrooge (1970), Christmas Carol (1984) and the animated 2009 film.<br /><br />I had hoped the animated one would have had a more complete story; all the versions have some vital storytelling missing.<br /><br />The 1984 film with George C. Scott looked like television, so the budget wasn't very fat, and it was filmed in standard TV format.<br /><br />I like the 1970 musical with Albert Finney, but it's musical. The film explored more about the relationship of Scrooge with Isabel, and added some footage beyond the grave with Ebby, which was fun, though, and the tunes are a little catchy.<br /><br />Seymour Hicks played a really crotchety Scrooge in the 1935 version, and you see Bob Cratchit weep over Tiny Tim's lifeless body. But it seems too short.<br /><br />Which leaves me with debating which Christmas Carol is better? The 1951 version, or this one?<br /><br />I guess the 1951 film is a smidge better, but I still rate this five stars. Alastair Sim played a top notch Scrooge in 1951, better than Reginald Owen, here. We see the wandering spirits early on in the later film, and the '51 version also has a better music track. This film also ignores the relationship between Scrooge and Marley, and about the people who rummaged Scrooge's belongings after he passed on.<br /><br />But the other characters make up for those flaws: I absolutely love watching Scrooge's nephew early on, in his jovial spirit, meeting the Cratchit cubs as they take a slide. Fred, Scrooge's nephew, really shines better here, as do all the Cratchit family, from Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, the real-life couple who play the parents of Tiny Tim, so much more humanly-played by Terry Kilburn. I think the supportive cast does a better job here, while Alastair Sim makes the best in his 1951 role. You really can do no wrong by getting both versions, because they have a different way of presenting this classic tale of greed and repentance. I just can't deduct a star from this, even though I think the '51 film is better. This just has too many moments and good supporting staff for me to deduct a star.

AMAZING!! | review/text: I am surprised that this movie is not more well known. I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt, and the movie simply blew my mind. It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe. The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings. I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film. SEE THIS MOVIE!

The comparison to Lonesome Dove makes me almost as queasy as this series. The acting by Sam Eliot was over the top. Lifetime relationships were formed and broken in minutes over the most trivial of things. The character played by Tom Selleck loses a wife and is tomcatting in the next five minutes.I did not know whether to laugh or cry with the cardboard characters portrayed by the mother and the dumb blond Selleck fell in love with. The ending was lame and anti climatic. Veteran actors such as Glen Ford/Slim Pickens/John Vernon/etc reduced to Monty Python status. Did these people really see westerns such as Lonesome Dove or Broken Trail or Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales or The Good,The Bad and the Ugly, just to name a few??? I honestly feel these "reviewers" were blind or bought. You should have partial stars as this series does not even rate one.I want my money back.

If George Lucas had only made this movie, it would be more than enough to call his life worthwhile.<br /><br />The film looks surprisingly good, considering the age and low budget. Audio fairs slightly worse, with dialogue sometimes tending to go just beyond earshot, but the movie's incredible soundtrack has never sounded better.<br /><br />Extras are satisfying for the most part, despite the fact that the only significant new feature, a video commentary by George Lucas, covers most of the same ground as the making-of documentary.<br /><br />Hey, it's American Graffiti, one of the greatest movies ever made, so it gets my recommendation based on that, but a movie like this deserves a much better release.

 | product/productId: 6302135621 | review/userId: AD3D7DYBSPVOQ | review/summary: No Jar Jar Binks! | review/text: With all due respect for the reviewer from New York (April 11, 2000) who found Citizen Kane boring, may I suggest a flickering white light, that sits two inches away from your eyeballs.  This will stimulate the nerves in  your retina that have obviously been deadened by episodes of &quot;the  worlds greatest car chases.&quot;  Although you may wish to rather view the  nightly news for more relevant stimuli, the notion that the  &quot;Rosebud&quot; plot of Citizen Kane is boring and been done, is well  taken.  However, I must confess igonorance to the subject.  Might this poor  player of a movie, be an original or dare I venture, an innovator of such a  genre?  While someone might indeed be able to find such filmmaking  techniques in &quot;A complete Idiots Guide to Filmmaking&quot; as you  suggest, I wonder whether those classic books were available at that time,  and why no modern filmmaker has seen fit to read them, as is evidenced by  the poorly shot, and poor plot films we are subject to today.  I saw  Citizen Kane recently, and though dissapointed there were no visable  explosions or gratuitous violence, was entertained to the point of thought  and retrospection.  The story in the film was not a special effect (a  departure I found unnerving) but rather a person, and the circumstance of  fame.  The filmmaking you mention as simple, did look pedestrian compared  to the computer graphics we see today, and one can only wonder why they  were once described as revolutionary.  I mean we see those shots in film  all the time today, so what was so special?  Despite it's obvious flaws,  the film remains probably the greatest ever.  It's just a shame, they  didn't have computer generation technology back then.  It would've made the  story of remembering one's innocence that much more compelling.  Maybe with  a character like Jar Jar, I would've felt his pain.  As the reviewer from  New York rightly states, this whole Rosebudgate has been done with better  flair with Watergate, Irangate, and Monicagate.  I mean, couldn't Mr.  Welles have learned from the sensationalism of the Watergate affair to make  a better movie?  I guess we will never know.  At least we have the nightly  news, and Monica Lewinksy to provide us with great theater.

It's the kind of warm and fuzzy movie to be enjoyed time and again. Robin Williams stars as a grown up Peter Pan(now named Peter Panning), who doesn't remember who he really is. While on a trip to Old Wendy's place, his two children are kidnapped by Captain Hook. With the help of Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Peter has to go to Never Never Land to save his kids, battle Captain Hook, and realize that he is the one and only Peter Pan. The costumes are great, the sets are awe inducing, and the actors are all game. People, I ask you, who is better at playing at a person who refuses to grow up than Robin Williams?. I don't think the part could of been better cast. Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook is an image to behold. It's a classic Hoffman performance. Keep an eye out for cameos by Phil Collins, Glenn Close, and a very young Gwynneth Paltrow. This movie should entertain kids and adults alike. Kids will cherish their youth, while adults will most definitley be transported back to a magical time to think about their own youth. This is a whimsical fairy tale that's a delight from the first to last frame. I can't believe why so many people have a deep disliking of this movie. Oh well. Their loss. Kudos to Spielberg for delivering a modern day fairy tale for viewers to cherish for years to come. I'm hooked!. Sorry.

I saw this film when it first came out, but it was so controversial then that many people sought to debunk it.  Like Orson Welles's &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (Okay - it's good, but not THAT good.) JFK, and its director Oliver Stone was subjected to incredible criticism.  Now that time has borne out Jim Garrison's version of events, JFK is even more accurate than originally thought.<p>The directors cut, along with the deleted scenes, has Oliver Stone admitting that he was playing a little fast and loose with the facts, but in a more conservative direction most of the time.  In other words, he downplayed some things that he believed to be true but could not adequately document.  The extra disk with an update on the Garrison version, and the interview with the mysterious Mr. X is priceless.<p>Be careful.  If you buy this DVD (and watch it, of course) you will never look at our government in the same way again.

I gave it to her today (11/4/09 - still in original wrapping as rcvd), we sat down to watch it but the tape would not play. We tried several times but it looks like it is simply defective. we did try other tapes just to make sure it wasn't the VCR, and the other tapes played fine. I wish I would have seen her sooner because now it is too late to return the item. I have purchased items from amazon before and never had any problems, I am very dissapointed with this purchase.

 | product/productId: 6301986156 | review/userId: A2T77ZRDKU6PA0 | review/summary: A Narrow Margin for Error | review/text: It is always a treat to see a "B-picture" that is so good, it is better than most A-grade pictures; this is such a film.  The fact that it, like FRANKENSTEIN (1931) doesn't have a soundtrack, only adds to its interest.<br /><br />A simple story: the protection of a gangster's widow on a train from Chicago to L.A., with hitmen aboard.  Charles McGraw is extremely memorable as the police protection.  Marie Windsor, as the spoiled yet frightened widow is also top-notch.<br /><br />As the train hurtles onward, one can't help feeling a tad claustrophobic, especially when the obese Paul Maxey blocks the corridor, and demonstrates the narrowness of the passage.  The atmosphere, combined with a growing sense of tension and suspense, helps to create one of film noir's true gems.<br /><br />This movie could have very easily lapsed into a run-of-the-mill B-picture.  But the efforts of the entire cast, George Diskant's photographic eye, Martin Goldsmith's pen, and Richard Fleischer's direction, keep it on track: literally.<br /><br />Warner has done a good job with the DVD quality; great picture and sound.  The DVD has a commentary by William Friedkin, augmented with previously recorded audio excerpts, featuring director Richard Fleischer.  The disc is available as a single purchase or in the "Film Noir Classic Collection", Vol.2.

 | product/productId: 0790736365 | review/userId: A7U1WGTLYH818 | review/summary: Very Surprised, Loved It | review/text: I rented this movie from Netflix from their recommendation for me because of movies containing Rufus Sewell and Oliver Platt. It was in my queue for months.  So after finishing the movie and drying my eyes, I went straight over to Amazon to order the DVD.  This is one of the best period movies ever.  I realize this is Hollywood's version of this true story, but it was so well done I've recommended it to all my friends. Everything about this movie works for me. The acting, costumes, cinematography, location and the story are all rich. Each character goes through major changes, some good some bad.  You wouldn't think a movie about a 'courtesan' could be funny, but there are some humerous parts blended in very well.<br />I have the book about Veronica Franco on my Wish List, and will be buying it at some point.

 | product/productId: 0792898605 | review/userId: A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4 | review/summary: Spectacular Animation. Bad Writing. | review/text: First released in 1988 to much acclaim, &quot;Akira&quot; is still considered to be a classic among Japanese anime films and might be considered an early example of cyberpunk cinema as well. The film is based on the comic books of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also directed the film. &quot;Akira&quot; depicts a post-apocalyptic Tokyo of 2019 that is plagued with  riots by day and terrorized by teenaged biker gangs at night. Young Tetsuo (voice of Nozomu Sasaki) is injured in a motorcycle accident and whisked away by military police who have arrived at the scene to collect a mysterious child who seems to have caused the accident. While in custody, Tetsuo becomes the subject of experiments which give him telekinetic powers. The leader of his gang and lifelong best friend, Kaneda (voice of Mitsuo Iwata) wants to rescue Tetsuo. And he is not the only one who wants to break into the  compound where Tetsuo is being held. A group of anti-government activists have their own reasons for seeking the powerful subjects of these human experiments.<p>The animation in &quot;Akira&quot; is spectacular. Some of the scenes are breathtaking. I was especially intrigued by the way that the artists imitated the properties of film with animation: I had never seen selective focus animated before. And I loved the way the taillights of the motorcycles leave light trails at night. If you are a big fan of anime, or would like to see some excellent examples of its potential, &quot;Akira&quot; is a film you must see. Otherwise, I have reservations about recommending it. Adapting the considerable quantity of material in a serial comic book to feature film length is always difficult, but &quot;Akira&quot; does an especially poor job of it. The story is utter chaos. Large parts of it are incoherent. At the film's conclusion, we still have no idea who many of the characters are or why they did what they did, what the film's point was, or if it was supposed to have one. The characters, themselves, are two-dimensional at best. I've seen much more effective characterizations in animated films. And you'll find better writing in most any animated film. So enjoy the animation, but don't expect much from the story. Japanese with English subtitles (a dubbed version is available).

I was riveted to my seat for the entire 1-hour, 51-minute film!<br /><br />I cannot rave enough about this picture! The opening shadowy scenes with Joan Crawford and Jack Carson are remarkable! The DVD version can only enhance this great photography.<br /><br />Carson, by the by, is fantastic in "Mildred". As is a quite young-looking Eve Arden.<br /><br />Also keep your eyes peeled for one of the best "screen slaps" I've seen in a while! Joan is belted a good whack by that brat of a daughter of hers (immaculately portrayed by Ann Blyth). Can someone say "Bad Seed"?!!<br /><br />If you've never seen "Mildred" before, do yourself a huge favor and do so.

This group, under the orders of Yasser Arafat, the guerrilla leader turned Nobel Peace Prize winner who forced his people's plight into the world spotlight, who died Thursday at age 75 - still reviled by many as a terrorist, has been all but exterminated by Israel military forces. The film is a shoker. "TWO THUMBS UP!"
 | product/productId: 6302054230 | review/userId: A3MT0YM4LU0AT2 | review/summary: Delicious satire... | review/text: This film is a great satire on the human race.  No other film seems to sum up the hysteria, naivety, prejudice, suspicion, gullibility and sheer aching ignorant stupidity of the human race!  Set the film in contemporary times and everybody would relish its accuracy and laugh fit to burst at our folly.  However, set it in biblical times, say around the time of Christ's ministry on earth to the ignorant masses - and there are charges of it being sacrilegious?  Let's not forget that Jesus' life on earth was abruptly terminated by those sensitive types who were irritated by his teachings and did not see anything amusing about him in any way.<br />See this film for what it is - a gentle satire on the human condition and laugh until you ache!
 | product/productId: 6301661745 | review/userId: ACLNARTC3NVJC | review/summary: One of the most popular series of all time | review/text: A brilliant commentary on society, racism and even the Theory of Relativity.  While none of the films are as fast-paced and fascinating as  the original, all provide pleasure.  Who would have thought Maurice Evans,  Samantha's father on &quot;Bewitched&quot; would make such a perfect Dr.  Zaius.  And take note of Charleton Heston, a magnificent actor-turned shill  for the NRA, showing his bare butt in the court scene. :)<p> Part 2,  Beneath, seems like the end, but it's really the beginning.  Get it?  You  will.  Overall, it's a bit schlocky, but fun.<p>Part 3, Escape, comes close  to the best story.  Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are fun to watch as they  return to the early 70s in Heston's original ship.<p>Part 4, Conquest , is  a gritty and brutal episode mirroring the race and anti-war protests of the  1960s.  Don Murray overacts to the gills.  There was a much different  ending that was cut from the film before it was released.<p>Only part 5,  Battle, is somewhat of a turkey with poor production values and cheesy  acting.  Director John Huston plays &quot;The Lawgiver.&quot;  Roddy is  good.  So is veteran Lew Ayres.<p>The winner in the box set is the AMC  documentary on the making of these films.  Otherwise, the lack of exras  would be a problem.  The transfers are sadly not anamorphic, but they still  rate about a 3 out of 5.<p>Tim Burton will make a terrific-looking version  of Planet, but no way will it have the multiple layers of the original.  Most of his films don't seem too coherent.  <p>Like Dune and Lord of the  Rings, this series is nearly a pop culture masterpiece.
 | product/productId: 5553600715 | review/userId: A2PCXXBTYRQ2FF | review/summary: A New Perspective | review/text: Contrary to the previews on television, The Others is not a spook flick. It is not about ghosts waiting behind closed doors ready to terrorize the characters, as well as the audience. Because of the way it was presented in those previews, it is a little disappointing emotionally as well as slow paced. However, its new perspective, which you must wait for until the very end of the film, more than makes up for this. On many subjects we assume so much and know so little. Once in a while, in the written word, or on the screen, we are faced with a new perspective that probes the deepest part of our soul. The Others is such a motion picture, the type that you cannot leave behind in the theater. While the cast's performance is excellent, it is the storyline that carries the movie. Whatever your values, beliefs or perceptions, The Others will compel you to reexamine them.

No one does it better than Abbott & Costello.  These movies were always on in my grandmother's house, and they still crack me up.  The first time we watched them, my daughter was a little frightened until I explained that they were just people dressed up and pretending to be scary and now she loves them!  I plan to start a new Halloween tradition to watch them each year (with popcorn of course) with our family after trick or treating :)
 | product/productId: 6301969782 | review/userId: AT57B36BHDQ00 | review/summary: Not as scary as the original but still very good | review/text: Although this 1990 remake of the scariest film I have ever seen is not<br />anywhere near as scary as the 1968 original, it is still a very good<br />film and has improved with age and repeated viewings. I first saw the<br />original NOLD upon the initial 1968 release at a drive-in, again in<br />1970 at a drive-in and then not again until around 1980 on VHS video.<br />In the interim I was lucky enough to find and buy the original<br />paperback edition of the 1974 Warner Books novelization. In the remake,<br />Tom Savini does a fine job with the director's chair and the film<br />benefits hugely from two very strong performances from Tony Todd and<br />Patricia Tallman. The make-up effects, on-location filming and music<br />are also all first-rate. It is a very worthwhile film despite being a<br />remake of a true classic. It does not attempt to be equal to or better<br />than the original. It doesn't copy the original scene-for-scene and<br />dialog-for-dialog. Although the plots are indeed very similar, the<br />remake offers some very unexpected twists and enhances some characters<br />while it somewhat changes others. And for those who have seen the<br />original film but not the remake, steer clear of reading spoilers for<br />the remake's ending. It was a touch of pure genius and won't be at all<br />what you will be expecting. See the remake but don't compare it to the<br />original classic. It stands very well on its own merits and even<br />compliments and pays homage and tribute to the 1968 version.

I have read books about Paul and Luke, and have to believe that their characters were much more colorful, in reality, which this film captures barely in shades of gray.  I purchase these types of films, for the purpose of showing them to those with little exposure to these stories.  This film was for me, laborious to watch.  I even broke out laughing out loud in a few places.  Sorry .... I cannot give this a higher rating.  It does not due Acts justice.  I hope that Visual Bible's 'Matthew' is of higher quality.
 | product/productId: 0783246641 | review/userId: A1PAXX69IFB1C5 | review/summary: TERRIBLE movie... but a classic! | review/text: The funny thing is, when this movie came out in the movie theaters, it rated only 2 out of 5 stars. It received the worst reviews of that year. All of a sudden, people are giving it 5 star ratings??? C'mon, people. The movie is TERRIBLE. It actually makes fun of itself (the scene where Bateman shoots and blows up the cop car, and he stares at the gun, for example). The movie never really makes sense.<br />HOWEVER.... I happen to love this movie! It is absolutely HYSTERICAL. It was supposed to be some kind of thriller, but it ends up being just a really dark comedy. After all these years, and having been probably the only person laughing out loud in the movie theater on release night (people were actually walking out of this one), I have seen how this movie has become a cult classic. But, that doesn't mean a cult classic is actually a good movie.<br />Buy this movie if you like dark, REALLY dark humor. There are scenes that will have you cracking up whenever you even think about it (the menage trois scene, for examply lmao). As long as you don't take the movie seriously, you will definitely love it.

In this dark comedy a psycotic cable installer Chip Douglas wishes to befriend his most recent custom Steven Kovacs, played by Matthew Brodderick.  The problem is Chip Douglas, played by Jim Carey, was raised by the Television and in his life television and reallity have merged with each other, causing him to have a very warped view of freindship. As you get further into the movie the actions of Chip Douglas become increasingly disturbing, but at the same time funny.  This comedy is not for all but if you are a Jim Carey fan and like different commedies then this is the movie for you.

Still | review/text: This movie started the martial arts film explosion in the US. Bruce Lee's skills were far above any other martial artist that followed him. It was various derivations from his original ideas for most things that happened later in the martial arts in America. Quoting Dana White of the UFC "Bruce started MMA (Mixed Martial Arts)." Years before it was figured out. First to teach non-chinese kung fu in the US. First to use real martial artist as villians in fight films. First to do a arm-bar to end a fight on film in the Shaolin Temple no less in this movie! (20 years before UFC.) It was his original idea later turned into the popular television show Kung-Fu.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie was easily his best film and was his launching pad to post humorous super stardom in the US.

The actors actually stayed inside an institute that was still in use at the time, so they spent time with actual patients. The story behind this film is interesting, and the meaning behind it isn't hard to see.<br /><br />The second disc with special features ACTUALLY HAS special features! There are so many dvd sets that really don't offer anything remotely interesting with the movie. Well, this dvd is certainly an exception. The Making Of is very interesting with interviews with Milos Forman, Michael Douglas, and many of the actors and actresses involved with the movie. It was a bit disappointing that they never talk to Jack Nicholson, but regardless of that.. the Making Of is really an interesting documentary. Paying a little extra to get this extra disc is definitely worth it.
 | product/productId: 080012166X | review/userId: ANKFV6COYCJ98 | review/summary: Synthesis of a Rich Tradition | review/text: ...This movie was NOT meant to be a faithful rendition of the original novel by Bram Stoker ("Bram Stoker's Dracula" in the title notwithstanding.) Vampire lore owes a great debt to this...gothic novelist, but the movie had  more grandiose goals than mere mimicry. This movie is a synthesis of the various subplots, interpretations, lore and speculation that has flowered AROUND the novel over the years. This is the movie of the Dracula tradition, not a purist's adaption of the novel.<p>The departures from the novel are not mere eye candy meant to appeal to a modern audience. Debates about how effectively the eye candy appeals are irrelevant. This was not their purpose. These "departures" are powerful interpretations that have compelled so many viewers, readers, and thinkers that they have become part of the way  we "know" Dracula. People have been thinking about Dracula for years. This movie is a documentation of that thought.<p>Lucy's and Mina's highly sensual encounters with the Count are  largely accepted interpretations of the unsupervised and thus highly suspicious encounters in the novel. The addition of "topical" material, like early cinematographs in the background, delve into the social context of the novel. Stoker's characters are fascinated with new technology. This informs their hopes, just as the mysterious villain from the east threatens their civilization. The brief little dance between Mina and Van Helsing represents the valorous love, tinged with barely concealed sensuality and possessiveness, that motivates all the men who fight for "their girls." Dracula himself has had so many romantic and sexual fantasies strung about him over the years that his transformation into a "lover" in this film is hardly suspect. Yes, this is a departure from the text, but certainly not the tradition that has evolved around Stoker's compelling title character. <p>In all, this movie deserves kudos for taking on a rich and complex tradition rather than merely a novel. The fact that it manages to be beautiful and include so many quality performances is simply icing on the cake. The result is perhaps disjointed, but faithful in its goal.
 | product/productId: 6301969855 | review/userId: A3LU79BYMWZEW9 | review/summary: Deneuve of dat woman! | review/text: Visually, THE HUNGER is just about all you can ask for.  In terms of plot development, those who find it lacking make a very good point.  It could have been, you'll pardon the expression, fleshed out a bit more.  But it does have Deneuve and Bowie as elegant vampires--undead who are living the high life in '80s Manhattan.  It's chic, stylish fun, and we audience members are as curious and (many of us anyway) as seduced by it all as Susan Sarandon's character ultimately is.  The variations on the classic vampire story conventions (namely, as others have pointed out, that these vampires go out in the daylight, don't seem unduly afraid of garlic or crucifixes, and speak with elegant--not comic--European accents) make the film more intriguing than it otherwise might have been, but what we ultimately need in the absence of all the old vampire cliches is a new mythology to hang the story on.  That may have been articulated in Whitley Strieber's source novel, but it's largely missing from the film.  There's something vague about Egyptian gods being at the root of it all.  OK, so how did this Nile Delta vampirism wend its way to Deneuve's France and/or Bowie's England?.  How did they meet, and just what was the nature of the 200 year old love story prior?  What makes her choose Bowie (then), or Sarandon (now) as a consort and not just another victim?  Why does the aging process, staved off for centuries, suddenly overtake Bowie with a vengeance, and why don't his (despearate?) killings of at least two young victims even begin to reverse the process?  Why Why Why?  Well, apparently the filmmakers did not want to burden us with all that detail.  They knew damn well that we'd be there for the elegant decadence and, of course, those equally elegant love scenes between Deneuve and Sarandon.  Worth the price of admission certainly.  Worth the price of purchasing the film in any currently available format?  Well, that's up to you, of course.  Me, I doubt I'll hanker to see THE HUNGER more than once more in my lifetime.  So as long as they have rentals, I'm good.  You, however, may choose to revive it more frequently.  In which case, you'll doubtless find is as collectible as Deneuve's Miriam finds her ghastly consorts.

Annnndddd that's about all the good I can say regarding this powerhouse display of no talent.<br /><br />Burt is pushing the laid-back, oddball "Burt" laugh wayyyy too much, to the point of nausea. The lead investigator displays emotional reactions and facial expressions that are dramatically unnecessary. It's like he had emotive Turret's.<br /><br />Plot's as simple as they come but then, that's to be forgiven as most plots were birthed in the 70's and are now merely rehashed in newer versions.

 | product/productId: 6301971272 | review/userId: A3SFO2GSP5CVSM | review/summary: Great | review/text: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly features one of the best film scores ever, by Ennio Morricone at his creative greatest, and it soars in the way it's applied to enhance even the most routine scenes; dazzling cinematography, by Tonino Delli Colli, including some of the best and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed; and well written and well acted characters, by the Good- Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and the Bad- Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), this film is dominated by the Ugly, Tuco Ramirez, the Mexican bandito played by Eli Wallach. The character is sort of an even more stylized riff on the bandito, Calvero, he essayed in The Magnificent Seven, which saw that character absorb some of the lunacy of the samurai played by Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai; but that's what makes it even better. It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history. He owns the picture, much in the same way as the Lee Van Cleef character owned For A Few Dollars More, and like Van Cleef's character, in that film, Tuco often outsmarts the Eastwood character, One simply cannot turn away, lest miss a sight gag or joke or wince of frustration that sets the screen alive. Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.<br /><br />The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually `feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film. This trend would reach its apex in Once Upon A Time In The West, but it started here, in this trilogy. Watch all three films, and especially this one, to see the proof that the terms `high art' and `fun' are not mutually exclusive. Now, get goin'!

Its the clearest transfer to date compared to on DVD. But if your expecting eye-popping detail HD-Clarity, you will not see it here. It looks like a Mpeg2 transfer. Can these movies ever be remastered in HD to give us what we expect, I don't know but I am still highly satisfied to have these movies on a disc that can probably outlast a nuclear war!

I read the book when I was a teenager, and it was nice to refresh my memory of the story, which is portrayed well in this movie.  However, if you are a young person considering watching this movie, I recommend you read the book first.  It isn't as daunting as some other books that were made into movies.  It is an easy read, and you won't regret letting your imagination draw the pictures first.  When you see the movie first, the characters are already formed in your mind when you read the book.
 | product/productId: 6301879201 | review/userId: A25DCIIUPTG2WN | review/summary: An Unlikely Pair | review/text: This Academy Award winning drama is a touching story about the coexistence of an aging southern woman and her chauffer.  Miss Daisy played by Jessica Tandy (Academy Award for Best Actress) is a feisty Jewish woman forced to endure the tragedy of growing older.  Her son played by Dan Aykroyd is faced with the dilemma of playing parent to his parent.  Morgan Freeman plays Hoke, the black chauffer hired by her son.  Set in Atlanta, GA beginning in the late 1940's this film spans 25 years of an unlikely friendship before and during the fight for Civil Rights.  A must see classic, this story keeps the audience wondering what will she think of next, and how will he handle it.  Skillfully done with everyday events and situations it is certainly deserving of the Best Picture Academy Award.

 | product/productId: 630223395X | review/userId: ANBZXW1BDGW3L | review/summary: Guilty Pleasure | review/text: This is probably the &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; to top all other guilty pleasures.  A made for TV flick that should have been released theatrically.  No major stars--though Fred Ward you may remember from &quot;Tremors&quot;--but one of the best made-for-TV movies ever broadcast.  No major special effects--no huge explosions--but the ones in the flick are human-sized (like the Borg queen in &quot;Strar Trek&quot;) and thus twice as interesting.  A lot of in-group jokes for genre lvoers, from Ward as Detective Harry P.Lovecraft to another named Bradbury.  A real popcorn thriller that's frequently hilarious to boot.  And at the price, one of the best bargains going.

 | product/productId: 0792842189 | review/userId: A7YRO6JIVVG7D | review/summary: Sweet little film | review/text: I found the opening shot in this film chilling, and not because I found the bees disturbing.  As the camera moves in to Peter Fonda's face, for a moment, he looks exactly like his dad....<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the film is slow moving.  If you're not the type to use honey because you're too impatient to wait for it to flow slowly from the jar, you probably won't appreciate what takes place here.  But a tension develops in the first moments of the film that is nicely sustained until the very end.  Further, there are some scenes in which the verisimiltude hits so close to home I found myself getting anxious.  Anyone with a dysfunctional family understands that as each member makes poor choices, the entire family is affected in some way eventually.  Enough said there.<br /><br />Peter Fonda has come into his own in this film.  I'd love to see him do more work like this.

Some parts of this film  were slow and not quite believable.  Overall, though, it was pretty well  done. There are a few good laughs, in particular when Irons has a  middle-aged lady in the stirrups; watch for that scene. Irons is absolutely  fascinating and convincingly portrays two look-alikes with different  personalities/habits. Worth watching just to see Irons' flawless  performance of the twisted brothers.
 | product/productId: 6302089824 | review/userId: A2BTXL0E3XE9MA | review/summary: Opera made Popular | review/text: If there ever was an artist who made opera reachable to anyone was Mario Lanza. His films made opera familiar to those people in countries not having an opera tradition. I can be a witness to that from the Dominican Republic of the 1950's. This video shows Lanza and his life. When a supermega star like Placido Domingo decides to become the voice of this project then you should realize the greatness of Lanza.  I read a book on the life of Jussi Bjorling and is interesting to read about the friendship and respect this other megastar had for Lanza. This video is a must for the new generation of opera lovers or curious so they know who was the generator of opera as a more popular art form years before the three tenors. Juan Mansfield

 | product/productId: 630193234X | review/userId: A190MOEY8O2ZMJ | review/summary: "Best Of" - With a Qualification | review/text: One factor for the quality of this film being as it is (not the video-to-film transfers which in and of themselves were nothing more than color kinescopes, but the quality of the material) has to do with the fact that this was drawn ONLY from shows produced between 1969 and 1972 (with the rendition of "Yakety Sax" as heard all through the picture, having originated from the Dec. 27, 1973 show), and produced/directed by one person, and one person only - John Robins.  Nothing of Hill's work up to that period from other producer/directors - which, up to the point this was prepared, also included David Bell, Keith Beckett and Peter Frazer-Jones - were even considered for inclusion, unfortunately, given that (as some may have suggested) the shows from these "other" directors may have been an improvement over what's offered here.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing:  In the "Lower Tidmarsh Hospital Service" sketch, there was a switcheroo in the music, with the original custom-scored medley as on the original Nov. 19, 1969 airing being replaced with a loop of the aforementioned 1973 version of "Yakety Sax" in the outdoor scenes and a stock-music piece heard in the hospital scenes.  This may have had something to do with music clearance issues, from one of two possibilities:  a) the use in the sketch as originally aired of Scott Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag," given that many Joplin tunes were heard in the then-recently released movie "The Sting"; or, more likely, b) the last song in the custom-scored medley, a cover of John Mayall's "Room to Move," which is perhaps his best-known tune from his most famous album, "The Turning Point."

 | product/productId: 5559375241 | review/userId: A3LZBOBV9H1HDV | review/summary: "The Village" is excellent! | review/text: "The Village" is excellent! The cast led by Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker, Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt, Adrien Brody as Noah Percy, William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, Brendan Gleeson as August Nicholson is excellent! Their performances are just as much as excellent as well. The master of thriller, M. Night Shyamalan, who wrote and directed "The Sixth Sense" (1999), "Unbreakable" (2000), & "Signs" (2002), his direction is brilliantly well crafted as is his story and screenplay. The music by James Newton Howard is brilliant and this is one of his best scores I have ever heard from him. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent and well crafted. The film editing by Christopher Tellefsen is excellent. The casting by Douglas Aibel (who did the casting to "Unbreakable" (2000) & "Signs" (2002) is excellent. The production design by Tom Foden is excellent and well designed. The art direction by Michael Manson & Chris Shriver is excellent and well crafted. The set decoration by Larry Dias is excellent and well crafted. The costume design by Ann Roth (who costume designed "Signs" (2002) is excellent and well designed. This is a well made movie with intriguing and interesting performances by Howard, Phoenix, Brody, Hurt, Weaver, & Gleeson.
 | product/productId: 0790733919 | review/userId: A1CJE1I3FZ32ID | review/summary: What we have here is my favorite movie. | review/text: Paul Newman in his late prime heads a memorable ensemble cast of prison characters including Harry Dean Stanton, Anthony Zerbe and noteably George Kennedy in his Oscar winning role as dragline. A battle of wills ensues with Luke versus all comers: prisoners, camp guards, tracking dogs, visiting family, God and finally the camp captain played by Strother Martin. While scenes of the egg contest and the girl washing a car are now movie icon, it's the less lauded scenes for me that grab you and keep you. If Luke talking to his dying mother in the back of a pickup truck or getting the help of two kids to cut his leg chain during an escape isn't Oscar material - What is? The music is sparse like the scenery and often provided by the Banjo picking of the convicts themselves. Any roads I first saw this on UK TV in the early seventies in its first showing - in glorious black and white. You lucky sods now get to see it in colour on DVD.

 | product/productId: 6301661745 | review/userId: AO588TLK3Q3HY | review/summary: A Marvelous Mirror of Human Behavior | review/text: &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; should be in any list of major movies of the 20th century because it is a poignant commentary on human behavior.  George Taylor (Charleton Heston) is one of four astronauts who crash land  on a planet where human beings are mute brutes dominated by intelligent  apes. Through Taylor's eyes, we observe the apes as they interact with each  other and with their human captives. We are treated, among other things, to  a wonderful commentary on American race relations as we discover that ape  society is stratified among orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees.  &quot;You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees,&quot; Dr. Zira  (Kim Hunter), referring to one of the orangutan elders, says to one of her  chimpanzee colleagues to which he responds &quot;the quota system has been  abolished! You made it. Why can't I?&quot; That the apes are meant to be  mirrors of human behavior is constantly reinforced throughout with  inversions of popular sayings and maxims: &quot;You know what they say-  human see; human do,&quot; one gorilla (Buck Karlitin) tells Dr. Zira.  Later. Later, an orangutan priest is overheard at a funeral saying  &quot;the deceased once said 'I never meant an ape I didn't like.&quot;  When the apes discover that Taylor is indeed an intelligent, thinking  being, they are at a loss to explain him; he does not fit into their  theology or their scientific theories. One chimpanzee, however, Dr.  Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) believes Taylor might be the &quot;missing  link&quot; in his theory of evolution, and here we are treated to a  wonderful inversion of Charles Darwin. Taylor's presence triggers a crisis  in ape intellectual circles. Soon Taylor, Cornelius, and Zira are placed on  trial during which an orangutan prosecutor argues that apes possess the  spark of divine being with all of the passion and conviction of William  Jennings Bryan in the Scopes &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; of the 1920's. During  this trial, we discover that the orangutan elders are a shortsided and  dogmatic set whose medieval-like dogma keeps ape society and learning  static. The trial presents the chimpanzee scientists with only one option,  to prove their theories or face conviction for heresy. To this end, they  rescue Taylor from captivity and set out for &quot;The Forbidden  Zone,&quot; a desolate stretch of the planet that hides the secrets of the  apes' origin and where Taylor learns the truth about the Planet of apes  (unfortunately, that truth and the movie's ending is given away by the  video box cover, but after almost 32 years, almost everyone knows the  ending anyway). Planet of the Apes is suitable for all ages. Children will,  I think, enjoy the action and the apes; adults will enjoy the intelligent  script (written by Rod Serling of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; fame, adapted  from Pierre Boulle's novel &quot;Les Planete Des Signes&quot;) and  hilarious and chilling inversions of human behavior. Profanity (very  little, except perhaps the last scene which contains most of the movie's  profanity, which is tame by today's standards) and violence are minimal. In  short, this movie does so well what science fiction was meant to do:  portray human behavior.

 | product/productId: 6300268993 | review/userId: A2HVL790PBWYTU | review/summary: The sequel doesn't disappoint! | review/text: Terrorists have planted an atomic bomb on the Eiffel Tower. Superman arrives in the nick of time and flings it into orbit, where it explodes. The detonation, however, sets free three Kryptonian criminals who have been languishing in the Phantom Zone, these renegades having been put there years ago by Jor-El, the father of Superman. Landing on Earth, the Kryptonians discover that the earth's sun grants them super powers. Immediately, they begin to enslave the planet. To make things worse, mastermind Lex Luthor escapes from prison and vows vengeance on Supes and joins the supervillains. Meanwhile, Daily Planet reporters Lois Lane & Clark Kent are on assignment on Niagara Falls, where Lois comes to suspect Clark of being the Man of Steel. Through a freak accident, Lois finds out she is right. Now, face to face, Lois & Clark own up to their feelings for each other. To be with Lois, Clark decides to relinquish his powers. It's not until afterwards that he becomes aware of the three supervillains from his home planet, but it's too late...With no Superman to protect our planet, it looks grim for Earthkind.<br /><br />This is one of those rare instances where the sequel actually is as good as the first movie. What's even more amazing is that they got it right despite all the behind-the-scenes wrangling and in-fighting that went on between  producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, director Richard Donner and actor Marlon Brando. The Salkinds had early on decided to have Superman I & II shot simultaneously. However, the filming of Superman I proved to be troublesome. Things got worse when Marlon Brando filed suit against the producers for failure to pay up on his profits from Superman I. Then, with about two thirds of Superman II having been filmed,  Donner, who had issues with the Salkinds, was fired and replaced with Richard Lester. Yet, somehow, Superman II rises above its makers and succeeds as a worthy sequel and a great movie in its own right.<br /><br />This time, there isn't an opening half hour of foreplay with the overbearing Marlon Brando and scenes of sterile Krypton; we get right into the pertinent storyline: the release of General Zod & co. and a powerless Clark Kent in love with Lois Lane. Not as episodic as the first one, II is more consistently plot driven. Reeve and Kidder are again SUPERB in their iconic roles. The scene where Lois finds out Supe's real identity is still one of my favorite cinematic denouements. The supporting cast, with Terence Stamp (Zod), Sarah Douglas (Ursa) and Gene Hackman (Luthor) as standouts, plays it real. The only downside with the acting for me is Jack O'Halloran's Non, who is played too much for laughs.<br /><br />The special effects are even better than in the first Superman. While certainly not up to the standards of today's technology, they still hold up well. Remember, these effects are a quarter of a century old! Special mention goes out to the fantastic and devastating battle royale of super powers between Superman and the Phantom Zone fugitives. Also satisfying is Clark Kent's revenge on a mortal bully at the finale.<br /><br />The special features are utter diddly-squat, consisting of a "cast & crew" breakdown and a theatrical trailer. You'd think there'd be at least some feature commentary or one "making of" segment. Ah, well.<br /><br />For those who yet don't know, the new Superman Returns picks up after Superman II, totally discounting Superman III & IV (which is fine by me). For great comic book action and more than a touch of romance, watch this one. It's really good.

Second of all, Halloween by Carpenter may be one of the best horror movie ever made but it's not the only one. Third of all, Halloween might not have been made if Suspiria did not exist, because it's one of Carpenter favorite movie and it influence him to make horror movies.<br /><br />So, why it is that praise and that popular? It's simple, the atmosphere, the incredibly creepy music, the great and shoking killing scenes, the ingenious use of color and the slow pacing of the action, are what you need to make a really scary horror movie.<br /><br />You whant to know what is a great horror movie?

His biggest fan, Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives the chance of a lifetime to meet his fictional hero, through a magic ticket that transports him inside a Slater movie.<br /><br />But the movie villain swipes the ticket and escapes into the real world. Slater and Danny must stop the crook by traveling back to reality, where the bad guys are not scripted to lose in the "closing" scene.<br /><br />Directed by John McTiernan and featuring a great cast - F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Anthony Quinn, Ian McKellen - the special effects are dynamite, with dialogue that doesn't take things all that seriously.<br /><br />By Schwarzenegger flawlessly pulling off such one-liners - "Could I speak to the drug dealer of the house, please?" and "Sir, are you a henchman?" - this is clearly a romp through a timeless genre, with the emphasis on Fun.

Perfect casting, too--Sigourney Weaver has  a ball avenging her numerous space-jockey roles, and the aliens push their  characters to the limit without crossing the fine line into overacting.  Alan Rickman steals the show, though. <p>I watched it twice (it was a long  flight; it beat listening to Bob Newhart on the comedy channel for the  millionth time) and bought the DVD.  Heartily recommended.
 | product/productId: 1558908242 | review/userId: AZK2T7YZBLW7X | review/summary: A Possibly Redundant, Clear Look at This Cinametic A+ | review/text: Director Quentin Tarantino has for now 10 years been widly regarded as an over-night success for this, his breakthrough tale of irony and fate that effects the lives of a few distinct characters over a period of two days. Tarantino's puzzle-effect took this once 'Monster-Movie' script and morphed it's bold stories into 'Pulp Fiction'..A drama/Mystery Crime epic that made several actors synonymous with success; Bruce Willis, Samual L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames. Lead by one of America's most beloved actors, John Travolta, this film uses it's audiences' imagination and memory to commit the convictions and events of the lives of these characters to their utmost importance. In a three part drama; a boxer (Bruce Willis) refuses to throw a championship fight, and in turn is pursued with vengeance by his manager (Ving Rhames). This manager's drug-addicted young wife (Uma Thurman) is trusted for that particular night, in the hands of his trusted hitman (John Travolta). This hitman is endulging in his day-to-day, job-to-bloody job career in a binding yet conflicting relationship with his partner (Samuel L. Jackson). This friendship/partnership to me subtly pays homage to the partnerships of buddy-cop triumphs of the past on screen, and it's power is broken wide open by a gripping character-realization by Jackson in the final scene. The circle of these characters, binded by completely separate conflicts, loops itself in this brilliant screenplay so as to make every action and recourse of one scene relevant to the next. I have for years admired not only the beautifully delivered performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Ving Rhames in this film, but more so Tarantino's unique piecing-together of the movie's plots. 'Irony' is the only word I can relate to the feel of this movie, and despite it's graphic dialogue and violence, the direction and acting power has the ability to overshadow 'Pulp Fiction's rough edge, and effect even those who have never watched it. Films like 'Pulp Fiction' must be extremely difficult to make, and for Tarantino to use this method of direction and writing, is the overwhelming successful technique that makes it stand out among look-alikes.

Even though she is no actress, the nudity and her nudity are probly worth watching.  With her ignorance of the war in Viet Nam that turned many people against her, it is a little slow but imaginative It will be a camp classic of films. Directed by her husbund he goes just to the edge, except at the begging, there is a lot of nudity (not Janes, except teaseing parts).  Althoug children could watch it (over 15.)  It is entertaining and a must for a library.  If only it was on DVD. I don't know if 15 and up would understand what wasgoing on, it would be a good movie as a starter. Preview it yourself before making a decision.

 | product/productId: 6300268039 | review/userId: A3FUUA7PQQAA9W | review/summary: Should have won Best Picture of 1975 | review/text: I can't say enough good things about this film. The very fact that the versatile director Sidney Lumet was even able to pull it off--and so convincingly--is amazing. It's also Pacino doing the finest work of his career. He is incredible in a difficult role; his stamina holds up throughout without any breaks in continuity, and he is able to make Sonny both tragic and likeable, even for all of the character's flawed logic and bumbling ineffectiveness as a robber. The scene towards the end when he dictates his will to the bank teller who writes it up is one of the most moving scenes in all of cinema. Lumet and crew are to all to be commended. The film's atmosphere is perfectly captured--you can FEEL the stifiling, sweltering heat inside the bank as if you are sitting in there with the hostages. If DDA hadn't been released during the same year as &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; (which swept almost ALL the Academy Awards in almost every major category for 1975) it would have won all of the same awards, hands down, as far as I'm concerned. As it turned out, it unfortunately won only one award, for screenplay. But awards or not, you will NEVER forget this movie. Pacino has never been this good, even in the Godfather series.

 | product/productId: 0767811712 | review/userId: AHUT55E980RDR | review/summary: The dog should've gotten an Oscar also.... | review/text: This was, I thought, a tailor-made role for Jack Nicholson.  Originally, I was rooting for Robert Duvall to win the best actor award, but after seeing this three times and analyzing the performance, I definitely agree with Jack Nicholson's win.  He is such a model of a miserable, despicable person, and yet you see little flicks of expression that reveal the real person within, the person he is trying to repress because he is more comfortable with people wanting nothing to do with him than he would be if he were liked.  <p>However, you can not fool a dog, even if you try to dump him down the chute for the trash.  And the dog is definitely one of the major factors enabling the good person within the Nicholson character to surface.  <p>There's a lot to be said for this film, but basically, it's been said.  I will say that I've watched it four times now and each time, find something I missed before.  I am not a Jack Nicholson fan, but he really shines here.  He has you quite despising him at first, and by the last half hour, you're rooting for him to succeed in redeeming himself.<p>This is considered a comedy, but there is a very serious undertone to it which is quite well brought out by the acting of the three principle characters (and the dog!).  <p>I hope you don't let any dislike of Jack Nicholson keep you from seeing this.  Chances are you'll end up glad you watched it.
 | product/productId: 5554462022 | review/userId: A2540MKQ9Q6N7Q | review/summary: Director's Definitive Cut on Blu-ray | review/text: This review refers to the Blu-ray of The Last of the Mohicans, "The Director's Definitive Cut." Be advised.<br /><br />The Movie: The Last of the Mohicans is an old favorite of mine and many of my friends. This "definitive cut" is new, and is the third cut of the film to see daylight. It seems to incorporate sizeable chunks of the extra footage from the "Expanded" edition on standard DVD while jettisoning a lot of footage from the same and including some deleted parts of the theatrical cut, but not all. Comparison showed few significant differences between this cut and the two preceding it; most of the changes came in editing (the battle scenes have all been tweaked a bit) and in shot selection. The good news is it's still The Last of the Mohicans, and it's still a fantastic movie.<br /><br />The Image: Reviewers elsewhere on the internet have complained about softness or excessive darkness in this Blu-ray's image. After watching the whole thing, I think such complaints are exaggerated. There are a number of soft scenes but the majority of the film is very sharp and the detail is a vast improvement from the standard definition DVD. The massacre after the surrender of the fort and the climactic fight on the mountainside look especially good. As for darkness, a good chunk of the film does take place at night or in dense forest, and there were no dark scenes in the Blu-ray that were not already dark on VHS or DVD. Darkness in some scenes--especially the forest ambush on the road to Fort William Henry--is certainly intentional and (speaking as a native of the area in which the movie was filmed) realistic. Rhododendron thickets are dark. Especially after comparison with the old DVD, this Blu-ray is solid.<br /><br />The Sound: As far as I can tell with my rather low-budget sound system, the mix on this Blu-ray was very good. The music especially boomed and the reports of weapons were very loud. There were one or two scenes in which the dialogue was rather muddy, such as the scene in which Hawkeye and the escapees of the massacre hide behind the waterfall, but that seems to have been intentional.<br /><br />Special Features: The commentary by Michael Mann is good and packed with information, both about the film and the historical period in which the film takes place. Mann clearly researched this subject deeply and his commentary is worth listening to. The Blu-ray also includes a very good 40+ minute "making of." Lots and lots of good interviews with cast, crew, and consultants, as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The background on Daniel Day-Lewis's preparation for his role was especially informative.<br /><br />Miscellaneous Complaint: The one thing in the whole package that gets on my nerves is that, in order to access the chapter menu either during the movie or from the main menu, you have to select "Search" from the menu and then choose "Scenes," an unnecessary extra step and an annoyance. That's a minor complain, though.<br /><br />Overall, this Blu-ray does justice to a great movie and was worth the money.<br /><br />Recommended.

The compassion and forcefulness she portrays as Joan of Arc is unmatched. This film moves along well, its integrated continuity of suspense and action will not let you leave your seat, and the dramatic intensity of the story will take you back in time. Even though you know how the story ends, you will find yourself yearning for, and even hoping, that the last minute rescue attempt succeeds.<br /><br />A Featurette on the DVD about the making of the film explains the extraordinary care and in-depth research by the screenwriters to ensure historical accuracy. Filmed by choice in the Czech Republic for its geographic similarity to medieval France, filming took place in several medieval castles. This cinematic version of "Joan of Arc" is the kind you will want to watch again and again. Lastly, you will want to have a box of tissues on hand before viewing.<br /><br />{An all-star cast, including Peter O'Toole, Jacqueline Bisset, Shirley MacLaine, Maximilian Schell, Robert Loggia, Peter Strauss, Olympia Dukakis, Powers Boothe, and Neil Patrick Harris}

 | product/productId: 6301395085 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: Topper | review/text: Uproarious comedy was yet another step to super-stardom for Cary Grant, who proves himself a gifted comic player as well as handsome leading man. Bennett (older sister of Joan) is the essence of high-toned style and beauty as wife Marion. Still the revelation is Young, who's a consistent delight as the put-upon Cosmo, a man who must cope not only with a rigid, controlling wife (Billie Burke), but a couple of goofy, upper crust specters who keep turning his well-ordered world upside down. A genuine screwball classic. Note: this DVD also includes the sequel "Topper Returns", which brings back Young (sans Grant and Bennett) and is good fun, though a tad contrived and not up to the first entry.
 | product/productId: 0783116896 | review/userId: A3N2SZKSUQNS6F | review/summary: A Powerful Take on a Continuing Controversy | review/text: This trilogy of stories is both powerful and thought provoking. The movie follows the stories of three women of different eras who are conflicted regarding their unplanned pregnancies. While fictional in form, in reality it reflects the changing views and policies toward abortion from the 1950's to the present era. <p>The setting of all three segments is in a single house. This masterful production/directorial technique seems to be symbolic for an issue which has always been controversial to many. As the house becomes more and more dilapidated over each segment, we also see that the right to abortion is becoming a compoundingly fragile right that could be taken away at any time. Instead of gaining strength over time, the volatile issue is subject to the demands of the political party in command.<p>The dynamics of the eras are reflected so realistically in each segment, that a viewer cannot help but to be actively drawn into the drama. The segments feature all-star casts including such heavy hitters as Demi Moore, Sissy Spacek, Cher, Anne Heche, and Jada Pinkett. Cher deserves special attention for both directing and acting in the excellent third segment. <p>Rather than pro-choice, I think the video challenges us to think, &quot;What if there were no choice?&quot; This is recommended viewing for women and men alike, and this movie will stay in your thoughts for a long time to come.

I guess it just goes to prove that some movie fans will embrace anything. To be honest, what makes the film for me is the perky, attractive Jane Daly. Why do the women I like always get eaten?<br /><br />If you like zombie movies, you know dirty, partially decomposed human bodies wandering around and groaning as they seek fresh human flesh to devour, you'll certainly want to add this one to your collection.

It is a reconstructed dialogue based on events and every attempt seems to have been made to give the characters some life. It was impossible for Heydrich to have a lazy eye, as he did in real life, so those little things couldn't be brought into the production. However the broad power plays and a recognition of 'illegality' could be portrayed.

While the added footage gives the audience a bit more information about Leon's past, it also builds tremendously on the relationship between Leon and Matilda (played by the buddingly beautiful Natalie Portman), his inadvertantly adopted 'partner.'<p>While there are a few scenes that arguably add little to the depth of the story, they are momentary and distract little from the narrative.<p>If you can get your hands on this version, it's well worth the viewing.

The tech details says it's 92 minutes, meaning 17 minutes are still missing (15% of the movie!) as was the case with the last release in which the movie did not flow right due to the heavy cuts.<br /><br />I have both the Itailan and Korean DVDs and they are UNCUT, but the Italian has no subtitles and the Korean has a below average image quality.<br /><br />Would Miramax please treat us as adults who can decide by themselves if a movie is appropriate or not and release an UNCUT version of this?<br /><br />Note that in NTSC(R1) the Uncut film is 109 minutes while in PAL (4% speed up) the uncut length is 103 minutes, so if you find a 103 version in pal(R2) buy it, it's the full version.

I am now 30 years old and still watch this movie 2-3 times a year to have a good laugh and put a smile on my face when I am feeling down and out.  It has Warren Beatty and Halle Berry in it, but what did it for me to go out and buy the movie was Beatty speaking the truth at the places he was giving speeches at.  Another reason I bought it was he raps in front of the family he was staying at while hiding out.<br />So if you enjoy an old school comedy drama and other elements in the same movie, then pick this up and prepare to laugh very hard in many scenes.  Plus also has many good actors in it for the time period.

 | product/productId: 0783225261 | review/userId: A138826JMC0J3T | review/summary: Half Baked | review/text: HALF BAKED is easily the stoner's guide for getting by and it's also really funny.  It's one of those movies that you could easily have it go either way (could be bad to some/could be good to others).  I personally thought it was really funny.<p>Thurgood (Dave Chappelle) is your typical custodian (or janitor if you wanna be a jerk about it) and he and his friends Scarface (Guillermo Diaz), Kenny (Harland Williams) and Brian (Jim Breuer) all have one thing in common.  They all have the same best friend, marijuana.  They've all been friends since middle school and now that they're grown up and live in New York City, the still do their favorite past time.  After Kenny gets in trouble with the police, it's up to Thurgood, Scarface and Brian to get him out.  The problem is that they don't have the money.  They decide that the only way to get him out is to do a little "fundraising" and sell marijuana.  They've got to hurry because on the inside Kenny makes a fellow inmate, Nasty Nate, mad and now Nate wants "something more" from Kenny.  This is really a laugh out loud comedy, packed with some great cameos and all out hilarity.<p>Now first off, this one isn't for younger viewers because of the drug content and drug use throughout the movie.  There's also a lot of swearing as well (not as bad as JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK but there's still a lot).  Even so, this movie is really funny.  There are a lot of laughs and Chappelle and the guys are really funny.  Plus all the cameos from Jon Stewart, Willie Nelson, Janine Garofalo, Tommy Chong, Bob Saget, Snoop Dogg and comedian David Edwards (Real World Los Angeles).  Plus there is a really funny scene in which Chappelle plays another character, Sir Smoke A Lot.  It's really funny.  Plus, Bob Saget (of all people) has a really, really outrageous line in the movie.  Trust me, the fact that it's Bob Saget just makes it wrong.<p>I'm not saying that you have to be into that stuff (marijuana and all) to laugh at this one because even if you look past all of the drug references and drug related topics, the movie will still make you laugh.  This is totally another great hang back and kick it movie, like FRIDAY and NEXT FRIDAY.  If you're looking for other funny movies like this one checl out those 2 and JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, DAZED AND CONFUSED and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.

"The James Stewart Hollywood Legend Collection" brings together five of his best known movies in pristine condition, although it  could have used a tad more diversity.<br /><br />"Vertigo" afflicts James "Scottie" Ferguson after a traumatic event on a rooftop, forcing him to retire. But when an old classmate asks him to investigate his wife Madeleine's (Kim Novak) odd behavior, Scottie agrees. When he falls in love with the woman -- and loses her to suicide -- Scottie begins to pursue a woman who is her mirror image, as he descends into madness...<br /><br />"Rear Window" is a somewhat less shocking Hitchcock movie. L.B. Jeffries has a nasty broken leg, so he's stuck in a wheelchair. He passes the time by spying on his neighbors, and contemplating his incompatibility with his pretty rich girlfriend (Grace Kelly). But L.B. spots someone acting suspiciously, and believes that the man has murdered his wife...<br /><br />"Harvey" remains one of the most enchanting movies to come out of Hollywood. Elwood P. Dowd is a sweet, considerate man who has a giant white rabbit (invisible, of course) named Harvey as his companion. Unfortunately, it's driving his sister Veta (Josephine Hul) and niece Myrtle May (Victoria Horne) completely nuts. Soon a bunch of mental health professionals are after Elwood... but is he crazy, or has he just found a way to be happier than everyone else?<br /><br />Apparently Stewart was searching for something a little less cuddly than his past roles, so he tried out westerns with a noir sensibility. "Winchester '73" is a gun that Lin McAdam wins in a shooting contest, and which is soon stolen by his rival, Dutch Henry Brown (McNally). Since McAdams already has a grudge against McNally, he goes on an obsessive quest to get his gun back... no matter what.<br /><br />But he had done some previous western roles, like in "Destry Rides Again." It takes place in the town of Bottleneck, whose sheriff has just died in suspicious circumstances. The town bad guy (Brian Donlevy) arranges for a drunk to be the new sheriff -- but the new sheriff brings in Tom Destry, the mild-mannered son of a local hero. And Tom Destry is going to clean up the town of Bottleneck... in his own unique way.<br /><br />There aren't really any flaws with this collection, in terms of the movies' quality -- all of them were brilliant in their respective ways. The only problem is that it doesn't really give a glimpse of all the roles that Stewart could do; for example, he was also great in romantic comedies like "Philadelphia Story." So where is it?<br /><br />But whatever movies he was in, Stewart was outstanding as a wry photographer, a lovable "nut," an unstable detective, and two cowboys. He nailed every one of those roles, no matter how odd or creepy. He's deeply unsettling in "Vertigo" and "Winchester 73," likably crusty in "Rear Window," and completely lovable in "Harvey." You love him or hate him as his character demands.<br /><br />And the movies themselves are top-notch: two are vintage Hitchcock, and one had the unique twist of taking place entirely in one room. They're all well-written and intelligent; wry humor is peppered through them, giving Stewart some of the best lines ("I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, Doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it!").<br /><br />James Stewart's excellent acting is on display in the "James Stewart Hollywood Legend Collection," which shows us some of the films that made him a Hollywood legend.

I was not impressed with this version at all. The quality was just not there, for picture &amp; music.<p> I'll stick to my 80's version of the classic, it was released though  &quot;Vestron Video&quot;, and its been modified.<p> But this version has  some cool groups from the 80's that performed on the soundtrack, such as  Bonnie Tylor, Queen, Jon Anderson, Lover Boy, ect, and I do belive it is a  classic to be experienced.<p> Now, this is not the fully restored version,  but it is very clear and clean.

 | product/productId: 0800182529 | review/userId: A84UFSF2SZS2W | review/summary: JUSTICE! | review/text: Demi Moore aside (and even she was not so bad) this was a great film. It was an interesting film about military protocol and investigations of crime within the ranks. Tom Cruise is great here as a self-assured Navy attorney who has to prove that two Marines accused of murder were only following orders. His real aim is to bring down those at the top of the chain of command. The cross examination scene between Cruise and Jack Nicholson is classic cinema and certainly one of the most memorable scenes of its kind in any legal drama. The late JT Walsh was also good in his role here, who would rather die by suicide than to live another dishonourable day.
 | product/productId: 5554498310 | review/userId: AB1UMC7SB9D7Z | review/summary: Modern/Human | review/text: Sam Peckinpah is known for his westerns, and here's another one.  However (this being the second western of his I've seen), I get the distinct feeling from him that he had a little more on his mind than genre.  I found Wild Bunch to be a heavily post-modern approach to the western story, making completely brutal characters out of archetypal heroes and turning typical gunfights into gritty massacres (like the end.  Everyone romanticizes it, but it's really just four really crazy but reserved men going into a town and shooting everyone, evil and innocent alike, with a huge machine gun until they're finally put to their own deaths.  Nothing heroic in it).<br /><br />This movie is more modernist, I'd say, with a bizarre sort of humor.  There's a nymphomaniacal priest, a bunch of characters that basically don't take each other seriously, and then there's our protagonist, who is "not a good man, and not a bad man, but a man."  Really that's all he is.  You don't sympathize with him, but then again you don't hate him.  He's just sort of there, in a recognizable and profound way.<br /><br />Peckinpah himself shows his visual cunning in this film, with acute transitions that really place a bizarre timeline to the film and, interestingly enough, a great sense of zoom.  Zoom, of all things.  I mean... zoom!  Who really makes an entire movie an artform out of just that?  Well, Sam does, I guess.<br /><br />Both westerns of his I've seen were about the end of the western era, and thus I think he himself is trying to end the genre itself by completely changing the contexts of the heroes we regarded in such films.  Cable Hogue is a great rag-to-riches story... but in the end who cares?  He's neither completely a man of the desert or a hero of the West.  He is confused by the approach of technology, but basically embraces it, and doesn't begrudge it its ending of his life and style.  This is VERY opposed to what I see most filmmakers do with the form, classically and contemperarily.  From the spaghetti westerns that idealized our great hero dominators of the frontier to the Kevin Costner laments of pain of the Native Americans who ended up losing their land, The Wild West is still, at heart, a romantic and amazing place like that out of a fairytale, Disney or Grimm.  peckinpah's West is a blank one, a dry one... and a humanist one.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB

 | product/productId: 6301773551 | review/userId: A1J3C23D6AYODI | review/summary: The power of The Farce | review/text: Obviously I haven't seen the actual DVDs yet, since they won't be released until September, but I *have* seen the transfer  that will make up the "bonus feature" on disc 2, the original 1977 version of "Star Wars" (as it was then known.)  I own the 1993 laserdisc.  That was "state-of-the-art" THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, but the state of the art has moved on considerably since then.  The transfer will look like trash on DVD, especially blown-up on a widescreen TV.  (Among other things the translation subtitles for the alien languages will be cut-off, since Lucasfilm and Fox decided to put electronic versions in the letterboxing bars rather than use a print with the subtitles burned into the film or at least have the electronic ones placed over the frame where they belong.)<br /><br />Even if you don't have a widescreen television, you should always insist that any DVD you buy today be "enhanced for widescreen TVs" or "enhanced for 16:9 displays".  Why?  1)  Chances are your next TV will be a widescreen HD set.  2)  An DVD enhanced for widescreen TVs can only be created from a very high-quality digital video master.  That means the studio can't just slap an existing laserdisc or VHS master created an old print years ago onto a DVD (which is what Lucasfilm is doing here.)  Instead they have to go back to the source material, and *create* a new hi-def digital master in cases where none existed before.  That produces a better looking and sounding result on both standard screens and wide screens.<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying this disc primarily to get a true high-quality DVD edition of the 1977 film, as I was, save your money.  I already own the Special Edition on DVD and the 1993 laserdisc.  I would have cheerfully bought this new release if it had included a newly remastered, enhanced-for-widescreen edition of "Star Wars".  But I'm not paying twice for material identical to what I already have.<br /><br />Perhaps if enough people ignore this release Lucasfilm will spend the money necessary to do a *proper* release of the film - which contrary to their claims is certainly possible with the use of the latest film restoration techniques and with source material that survives in the hands of private collectors.  I can't imagine that they will have any trouble making their money back, since I, for one, have bought about six different editions of these movies on home video.  But I won't buy this one.<br /><br />Quite apart from anything else, the three original "Star Wars" films, especially this one, are a part of film history.  They changed the industry, they changed the expectations of the audience.  But it was the film released in 1977 that did all that, not the revised, improved and prettied-up version released in theaters many years later.  The original film should always be preserved and made available *as it was* in the best format available for today's audiences and for future generations.  No one can judge the impact the film had by watching the 2nd re-edit of the film done 27 years after the fact.<br /><br />Vote with your wallets.  Vote "no" to a grudging and insulting release.  Vote "yes" for a future release done right.  Do *not* pre-order this nonsense.  It may not be too late to change some minds at Lucasfilm.

 | product/productId: 6302121620 | review/userId: A2U974OZOVRT7A | review/summary: The Lady In The Lake | review/text: This is a review for THE LADY IN THE LAKE (1947) directed by Robert Montgomery. THE LADY IN THE LAKE is the famous forties mystery featuring Philip Marlowe that uses the subjective camera technique, in other words, "all the characters talk to you." The camera substitutes  for Philip Marlowe, played by Robert Montgomery in THE LADY IN THE LAKE, and it is quite an experience for the first portion of the film but after a while it does get a little tiring.  Also, after a while, it does seem more like a gimmick more than anything else, excepting maybe a waste of all that wonderful forties ambience and atmosphere used in such a wrongheaded fashion.<br /><br />The story concerns the missing wife of the publisher of a crime magazine and the publisher's assistant (and apparent lover), Adraianne Fromsett, played by Audrey Totter, who hires Marlowe (and buys a detective story from him) to<br />help solve the case.  Before he knows it Marlowe is up to his typewriter in mystery, mayhem and murder.<br /><br />THE LADY IN THE LAKE features some fine supporting performances from Lloyd Nolan, Tom Tully, Leon Ames and Jayne Meadows but the two stars, Mr. Montgomery and Audrey Totter probably would've benefitted from a more conventionally filmed story.<br /><br />I'm afraid I have to rate THE LADY IN THE LAKE Three and One Half Stars.

 | product/productId: 0767802799 | review/userId: ANGH6401L9Y0T | review/summary: The Title Can Be Interpreted Many Ways | review/text: Edith Wharton wrote American literature that reads like English: very proper upper crust in New York instead of London, but otherwise very similar. And into this stiff society came the countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), an American who married a count and lived to regret it. We never get a lot of detail, but apparently the count was pretty beastly, although perhaps not quite Dracula.<br /><br />So Ellen returned to her family in New York just after her cousin May Welland (Winona Ryder) has gotten engaged to the charming but somewhat distant attorney, Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis). Ellen and Newland remember one another as children, but they are certainly not children any longer.<br /><br />Can one make a story of forbidden love in 1993 that goes no further than some rather passionate kissing with all their clothes on? Well, he makes one very big deal out of unbuttoning her glove at one point so he can kiss her wrist. The answer is yes, if your writer is from the era when that's the way writers did it: all innuendo and thwarted desire.<br /><br />One of the most amusing characters is great Aunt Mingott (Miriam Margolyes), who with the best of intentions in the world, has her finger on every pulse and in every pie from her first floor bedroom to which her obesity confines her. You might be tempted to call her an old busybody, but she really does have her family's happiness at heart, and is a deft manipulator. A couple of years ago, I would have delighted to play the role.<br /><br />Winona Rider is adorable, and a competent actress. The role has more scope than it seems to at the beginning, and she rises to it. I'm going to have to look for what she's done more recently.

The products of their lives are dove deeply into successfully, each character facing dramatic problems that make us care. Though not a farmer, this is very convincingly real and believable, at the same time unpredictable.  With a movie this long, you don't notice how long it is because it sucks you into it, and is one of the better westerns that the public has ever seen.

As soon as Peyton settles in, she begins the slow and deliberate seduction and destruction of Sciorra's family, with the ultimate goal of stealing both husband and children away from the woman she considers responsible for the destruction of her own life.<br /><br />Peyton is, ironically, a somewhat sympathetic character, who seems more dynamic than Sciorra's mousy Claire, at least until she starts to spit venom as her carefully constructed fantasy world begins to collapse.<br /><br />The best thing about THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE is DeMornay herself, who moves from shyness and gentleness to brazenness and cruelty with an ease that is really disturbing. DeMornay is not a great actress, but she always projects an underlying predatory sexuality that THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE exploits magnificently.<br /><br />When DeMornay's Peyton finally takes leave of her senses she is absolutely, convincingly, terrifying.<br /><br />Always, ALWAYS, get references!
 | product/productId: 6302238331 | review/userId: A1NAGYEOC6ZEHW | review/summary: Gritty Fun | review/text: Yes, everybody describes this movie as "gritty" and I do too.  "The French Connection" was filmed in a style which makes you feel like you're following these two guys around as they try to figure out what the drug dealers of New York City and Marseille are up to.  The storytelling is very well-done, as we are given signs of both hope and despair as the police find clues leading to when the big drug switch is going to take place.  This movie paved the way for some great film acting careers for Gene Hackman, who's still going strong in movies like "The Royal Tenenbaums," and Roy Schieder, who we'll always remember as Chief Brody in "Jaws," a classic in its own right.  If you want to know why everybody says that the 1970s were a great film decade, see "The French Connection" (and also "Chinatown" if you have time!)

I thought it would be a lot more enjoyable than it was. Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams make a charming pair, but they are given very little to do. Red Skelton sinks the movie. His performance and scenes are unfunny. Betty Garrett adds some sparkle to the proceedings, but it's too little too late.

It is great, but I think you would  first want to check out the other two. My favorite scene: The one where  Frank and Ed go into the sex shop while Norberg is going under all the  cars. Another downer: there were too many jokes stolen from the series it  was based on, Police Squad! Otherwise, very good and very very funny.
 | product/productId: 6300268780 | review/userId: A1YAPT3XGMZJ06 | review/summary: They Just Don't Make 'em Like This Anymore | review/text: And there is a reason why. In the ever growing rush to "push the envelope" and "narrow cast" a demographic, most of today's comedic directors either try to out gross their audiences or create pieces so targeted there is no appeal to the public in general.<br /><br />"The Great Race" along with "It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World", "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines" and others from their time remind us how great comedic writing used to be.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, the character establishment vignettes set the tone for the classic conflict of good and evil between Tony Curtis' "The Great Leslie" and Jack Lemon's "Professor Fate". The movie is a non-stop comedy that has some of the finest moments in comedic film. Featuring wonderful appearances by such character actors as Arthur O'Connel, Vivian Vance, Larry Storch, and Ross Martin (as the unforgettable Baron Rolfe von Stuppe); the Great Race still holds up well after 40 years.<br /><br />For no other reason, buy this DVD to see THE greatest pie fight ever to be caught on celluloid.
 | product/productId: 0792840852 | review/userId: A1EARN5PUVIF1S | review/summary: THIS Is Entertainment! | review/text: I'm embarrassed to say that I had never even heard of this film musical until I encountered it on Roger Ebert's list of all-time greatest movies (I'm checking them out at the public library, and as this title suggests, I'm up to the B's as of this writing).<br /><br />Well, Ebert's correct as always.  This is a WONDERFUL musical, powered by the songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and a brilliant cast led by Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Nanette Fabray, and Oscar Levant.<br /><br />Impeccably directed by Vincente Minnelli, the movie tells the story of the making of a Broadway show, starring a famous star on a downward trajectory in his career (played by Astaire) and an ascendant ballet dancer (played by a gorgeous Charisse in her first acting role).<br /><br />Outstanding numbers here include the immortal "That's Entertainment," "Louisiana Hayride," and "Dancing in the Dark," although the scenes featuring lesser known tunes are showstoppers as well, including "A Shine on Your Shoes" and "Triplets," both of which must truly be seen to be believed.<br /><br />This double-disc DVD set merits special recognition as well, as the film has been beautifully restored to do justice to Minnelli's brilliant and meticulously selected color palette, and the second disc includes fascinating features on the making of the film and highlights of Minnelli's career.<br /><br />I must also make mention of one of the best film commentary tracks I've ever heard, featuring Great American Songbook scholar and singer Michael Feinstein and his good buddy, the one and only Liza Minnelli, who apparently got to visit the set every day and watch her dad shoot the film back in 1952.  Liza's in an exceptionally ebullient mood here, and both commentators avow that "The Band Wagon" is their all-time favorite film musical.<br /><br />Pick up this DVD set for your family, and you'll see why.  And if the reprise of "That's Entertainment" at the finale of the film doesn't leave you in tears of joy -- well, I wonder what could.  HIGHLY recommended...

 | product/productId: 6300189015 | review/userId: A29SJTG21BVWF4 | review/summary: 5-star horror | review/text: This film, even by today's standard, is an awe inspiring epic horror film that changed the horror genre forever. This movie is one of the reasons why slasher films have become so popular.  Because it gives you what you want, solid acting, a great plot, the ability to make people scared, a bad guy who you can't really figure out on what he is going to do next, and you don't know where the plot is going to end up.  What could be better for a horror film?<br /><br />This film is one of the last truely scary horror films that have been made in the past 30 years.  It is a very original film and the low-budget makes the atmosphere of the film just a little bit more frightening because it makes the movie seem  just that much more real.  Most of the characters are intellegant enough to actually become aware that they control their own dreams and therefore their destiny in their own dreams, although a momentary lap in this thought got the supporting characters killed.  Which states that the characters are strong characters that just couldn't hang on until the end to defeat Freddy.  Our main character was the only one strong enough to "survive" the onslaught of freddy's attacks for revenge. Because of that, this film is brillantly directed and written by one of the master's of horror, Wes Craven. A must see film for everyone at anytime in the year, not just during halloween season.
 | product/productId: 6302380553 | review/userId: A9GEM2CVJ7292 | review/summary: The "gold standard" of the Bond series | review/text: This was, and still is, the very best of the Bond series, the moment where everything came together and the formula for all the subsequent Bond films was set. Though a product of its time (meaning it's not always particularly PC), it's the greatest and most legendary of the Bonds with one classic scene after another. Of course, it all climaxes in the movie's sterling caper, which was quite different than the one depicted  in Ian Fleming's novel. Some may quibble, but the movie's raid on Fort Knox is a much more "inspired" idea, just as Connery says in the film. It's amazing to think just how much arose from this mere 2 hours of movie making in the way of `60s culture, and how it defined and helped mold that era. Definitely a must-see. For many Bond afficionados, it remains the high bar. (Side note: This DVD version offers some excellent extras, such as the various documentaries and the commentary.)
 | product/productId: 6300989003 | review/userId: ATB5RFRMUWKZZ | review/summary: Many more laughs than The Out of Towners | review/text: I recently watched, and hated, the Out of Towners staring Jack Lemmon. As I watched Planes Trains & Autos, I was immediately reminded of the Out of Towners.<br /><br />In the Out of Towners, Jack Lemmon is trying to get into New York City for his big chance job interview and in Planes Trains, & Autos, Steve Martin is trying to get out of New York and make it home in time for the holidays. On his way home, fate binds Candy (who is also heading for home) together with Martin. Each movie has one scene after another of travel woes a la the Peter Principle "if it can go wrong, it will go wrong." All Lemmon does in each scene is rant and scream about how screwed up things are and demonstrate an ever increasing amount of irritation. This got old for me after a few scenes and I found the movie as irritating as Jack Lemmon did and not funny at all.<br /><br />One big difference between the two films is the odd couple team of John Candy and Steve Martin. They make the irritation funny. Instead of one scene after another of the Peter Principle with Lemmon's ranting in each scene, we have the humor of two completely different men encountering the same problems and reacting differently. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a little irritating, but it has much more humor.

Everything, the jungle, the warplanes and especially the water had a close-up feel to it and had a brilliant colour to it. The island looked like the set of Gilligan's Island (season 3)so it sure wasn't a gritty atmosphere. Secondly, the acting is bad. Stiff, wooden actors like veteran Clint Walker has the lead as a soft-hearted Captain who must lead his group of obviously unqualified losers while they crash on an uncharted island in the Pacific during WWII. His close friend, pharmacist (?) Franky helps Clint with morale support throughout the adventure of having a small core of Japanese misfits on the island along with them as their enemy. Another laugher is Tommy Sands as Marine Lieutenant Blair. Sands plays it straight as a tough talking wanabe brat coming up through the ranks and his acting in this one is great....well, funny anyway. What starts out as a lean mean killing machine of a Lieuutenant turns into mush as he's almost loved to death by the opposing side. Sinatra is too much as the guy just does not belong here! It was hilarious to watch him ham it up with his Vegas lingo while everyone around him tries very hard to be serious. He's loaded half the movie and I wonder if that was only in the scenes! The Japanese are just as vicious as each side threatens, trades fish for cigarettes, and even ask Frankie to amputate an enemy's leg in return for some potatoes and dried fish! Priceless I tell ya! This is hokey fun where everyone, including the Japanese Captain is as scary as a fly beating on your screen door. I have to believe that this movie wasn't supposed to be taken all that seriously, or was it? This was a Sinatra Production and, to me anyway, it was just a fun, big budget love-fest to show that Mr. S was in charge and doing it "his way". I usually look to see where a movie's at time-wise while watching it, and for some twisted reason I didn't do that here as I was enjoying this too much. Go figure. It's a keeper and it's beyond me why. Maybe just because it's simple fun and that's what it's all about isn't it?
 | product/productId: 079215228X | review/userId: A1YB29BIDULEYE | review/summary: Beauty, Sadness, Love, Suspense, Comedy, Etc | review/text: Generally speaking, I have enjoyed most of Ptrick Swayze's movies. I consider him to be an underrated actor. While he often plays a noraml person, he seems unusually talented in letting circumstances around him affect his normal personality within reason.<br /><br />The movie starts with peaceful and normal as Swayze, Moore, cleaning their new apartment with help from thier friend Carl. Through good directing, there is a tragic foreshadowing of the events of this story. Moore and Swayze are lovers, but Moore can not convince him to marry her. (This underlines that just because you are intimate with someone and feel you love them, that does NOT mean that you are ready to make a complete gift of yourself to the person, which means the love is incomplete.)<br /><br />Early on, Swayze is murdered, and it APPEARS to be a typical robbery. The scene where Swze realizes that he is dead is full of DEEP sadness, but is still done with artistic beauty. One wonderful thing about Swayze is that he can be strong, BUT STILL VULNERABLE AND ENDEARING!<br /><br />Moving on, Swayze goes through the deep sadness of being able to be with Moore (in a way) but powerless to comfort her in her sadness. (Talk about poignant!)<br /><br />Without going into too many details, Swayze learns his murder may have been only a part in an elaborate crime, and that Moore is in danger. He finds help from a pyschic medium (Goldberg) She is shifty and she often cheats people, but she is HILARIOUS! She is frightened when she realizes that she can actually hear Swayze. She adds the VERY MUCH NEEDED comic relief to this story. Without her it would have been too morose. At first she reluctantly helps Swayze to get rid of him; but then she helps him because she finds she may be in danger; but then because she grows to care about Swayze and Moore. WONDERFUL FORMULA!<br /><br />There is just the right touch of the Scooby Doo formula. (Linking ghosts to criminal activity, only this time, the ghost is the good guy!)<br /><br />it is interesting that when for obvious reasons, Moore and Swayze can no longer be intimate they discover the depth of their love. Patrick did lay down his life for her, and as Jesus said: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man may lay down his life for his friends" ("John" 15:13).<br /><br />Swayze has made many great movies, but this is arguably his best! It is a perfect combination of love, sadness, suspense, and comic relief. Also, in the event you don't know this, Patrick Swayze has cancer. Please keep him in your prayers.
 | product/productId: 0780619684 | review/userId: A25H7KHBUW4EUT | review/summary: It's Supposed to be Stupid [..]! | review/text: If there is a film out there that has created such an rift among viewers as Dumb and Dumber, I'd like to see it. It seems that everyone I know either loves the movie or abhorrs it. It is easy to see why people love the  movie. The movie is outrageously funny, and I believe most of the film's  critics will concede this. However, without fail, the number one critique  of the film by opponents is, &quot;but it's so stupid.&quot; This is like  saying you don't like Schindler's List because &quot;it's too  serious.&quot; Of course it's stupid! That's the point! Unfortunately,  pounding the keys on the keyboard harder isn't helping to portray my  sentiments here. First of all, this is not a movie you can only see once.  Sure, one viewing will account for all the &quot;big laughs&quot;, Lloyd's  airport fiasco, Harry's bathroom adventure and the ski lift accident. If  you base your judgement on the big laughs alone, I can see how the movie  could seem innane and childish. I suggest every critic of Dumb and Dumber  should watch the movie a few more times for the little laughs.  There  are so many jokes and they are so clever that I find myself appreciating  the movie more each time I watch it. For example, in the scene with the  state trooper (Harland Williams) the center of comedic attention is clearly  the point at which the officer drinks the beer bottle full of urine. This  &quot;big laugh&quot; often steals the limelight away from the smaller  laughs in the same scene. While handing the bottle over to the trooper,  Lloyd accidentally spills some of the urine on Harry, to Harry's obvious  displeasure. When the officer realizes what it is he has swallowed, one can  faintly hear Lloyd suggest, &quot;Tic Tac sir?&quot; It is subtle moments  like these that pervade the movie and make it great every time you watch  it. I think part of the problem with the movie is that there are simply too  many jokes in the movie. Many of the more subtle, clever jokes get  overshadowed by bigger ones, leaving some feeling like the movie is simple  toilet humor. This is a grave injustice.  Perhaps the most complexing  issue concerning the critical reception of Dumb and Dumber is the  overwhelming acclaim of the Farelly brother's follow-up film, There's  Something About Mary. The two movies are eerily similar. Both involve a  road trip starting in Providence. These trips are in search of a woman who  is way to good for her respective suitor. In both, the protagonists  encounter difficulty and comedic moments along the way. Yet everyone I know  loves Mary, while Dumb and Dumber recieves mixed reviews. The only  significant difference between the two films is that in Dumb and Dumber,  our hero doesn't get the girl. Perhaps this is why reception of the movie  is so clearly delineated along gender lines. Women, I can only assume, want  Dumb and Dumber to be a romantic comedy, which it is clearly not. Mary can  be seen perhaps as fitting this genre because it has the textbook 'boy gets  girl' ending (although my mother wanted Brett Favre to get the girl). The  fact that Dumber doesn't fall into the obligatory cliche ending is, in my  opinion, a large part of it's appeal. Whether you like it or not, you  should buy a copy of Dumb and Dumber and watch it fifty times like I have.  Then I think you will understand that being stupid is &quot;genius, sheer  genius.&quot;

And when I was little, everything, especially Santa, was breathtakingly real. No matter that I froze my little tail off standing on 34th Street and 6th Avenue for hours (starting at 7 am, so we could get a good view of the parade!) -- on each and every Thanksgiving Day, my heart was warmed by the floats, the merriment, and....especially, Santa.<p>So naturally, while watching this movie, I almost felt like I could look into the crowd and see....me!!! I can really relate to this movie!!<p>The casting was perfection! From the unbelieving shop owner and his reindeer props, to the innocent little boy on the witness stand, from the bustling crowds in the street, to the interior of the typical (for that era) NY apartment building, the cast of characters and the sets were totally realistic. <p>And I loved the little girl played by cute little Natalie Wood -- hey back then, when I was 5 years old, I even WORE outfits just like hers!!!<p>What's NOT to love in this movie!!???<p>Although I never chanced on this movie until the 1970's (which left me and my "little" sister awestruck), I have watched it faithfully every year since then. Each time I see it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time over and over again -- this movie still speaks volumes to me.<p>The funniest part of the movie (to me and Sis, anyway!) is when the Macy*s executive's wife (who is totally snockered) answers the (old, heavy, cast iron, just like my grandma's) phone.<p>And the most breathtaking part of the movie-- well...is that really Kris Kringle's cane there, over in the corner?<p>This movie should be "required viewing" in every grade school.
 | product/productId: 6302021588 | review/userId: A26HFSVLAGULIM | review/summary: AT THE RIGHT TIME: JACKIE ROBINSON'S THE RIGHT MAN TO GET THE JOB DONE!, | review/text: IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />It has been said that the best 3 things about America are "The Constitution", "Jazz", and "Baseball". Well, in 1946 it was time for Major League Baseball to ante up and rise to join the big leagues. "The Jackie Robinson Story" is the tale of an important journey on that bumpy road that America, through Major League baseball, finally and convulsively faced.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?<br /><br />Things anyone should be able to take for granted were considered out of the reach for too many Americans who were victims of a system that had hung around far too long. Jackie Robinson, by virtue of his talent and to a larger measure his solid character, was the right man at the right time to get the job done.<br /><br />The "color line", an invisible wall that never should have been constructed, was voluntarily destructed but it was not easy. This film tells us how this barrier was approached and the attitudes of those on all sides of the question. In many cases, it was not a pretty picture.<br /><br />Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, has the unique distinction of taking the moral high road while acting in the best interests of his team, his sport, and his country.<br /><br />Jackie Robinson, who plays himself in the movie (and does it very well), is clearly a human being that deserves the opportunities he gets and he earns everyone's respect in the process, fans and foes alike.<br /><br />MUCH MORE THAN JUST A SPORT MOVIE BIOGRAPHY:<br /><br />Yes, it is a taut and compelling film involving major league baseball and human rights. More than that, it illustrates the naked, blind cruelty that seemed to grip people from all walks of life over the color issue as well as the sterling characters of a few mavericks. This is a film that shows more than it tells and that is always the best way to present a story.<br /><br />THE CAST:<br /><br />Jackie Robinson plays himself and of course needs no introduction. Ruby Dee plays the young woman he marries and who demonstrates the same brand of courage as her husband. Ruby Dee later starred along side Sidney Poitier in "A Raisin In The Sun" and as Jackie Robinson's mother in the 1990 TV movie "The Court Martial of Jackie Robinson. Minor Watson plays Dodgers owner Branch Richey and portrays him as a rough-but-fair businessman who is obviously disgusted over the "color line" in baseball and is the man who finally facilitates its overdue termination.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: This DVD is a Digiview Production and is "Digitally Remastered" in Black and White
 | product/productId: 630018224X | review/userId: A1C80B497LCYKA | review/summary: UNQUESTIONABLY A GREAT FILM - BUT SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGACY VERSION | review/text: The Sting is unquestionably one of the great films of cinema and one of the most entertaining. Winning seven Academy Awards in 1973 (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Song Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design), it was the second great Newman and Redford pairing (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid being the first in 1969). Both films start out with top notch scripts, both were directed by George Roy Hill, and both did well at the box office (Butch Cassidy being top grosser in '69).<br /><br />If you don't know what the film is about, it's a con. Set in the thirties, and brimming over with wonderful Scott Joplin ragtime tunes, it has a light, playful feel that is likeable on every level. When Hooker (Redford) loses his small-town grifting partner to a Chicago syndicate hit, he enlists the help of Chicago con man Gondorf (Newman) to help him get revenge on the syndicate's boss, Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). First they take his money in what has to be one of the best card games in cinema, and, in my opinion, the best scene in the movie. Newman is classic as an obnoxiously drunk, arrogant card shark, and Redford is equally good as his vulnerable errand boy. After that, they continue to lead Lonnegan down the rosy path and into their trap, with the help of a host of wonderful characters played by some of the greatest character actors of the period.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this film is that, not only is Lonnegan conned by the end of the movie - so are we! The writer, David Ward, did such a good job layering the plot, and giving it so many twists and turns, that we are as unaware as Shaw's character that we are being had. It really is a marvelous piece of entertainment.<br /><br />As far as the controversial Universal Legacy Series DVD, I have watched the new, widescreen version and the old, full-screen version side-by-side, and can tell you unequivocally that the widescreen version WAS INDEED made from the full-screen version, as some have asserted. In other words, black bands WERE added to the top and bottom of the full-screen version to create the widescreen version. For this reason, Universal has reissued the original full screen version.<br /><br />There is also a difference in color between the two versions. While the picture of the earlier, full-screen version is not nearly as good as the new widescreen, the widescreen has been pushed too far to the cyan side of the color scale, so that it has a definite blue-green tint. You may not notice it when watching the widescreen by itself; but if you watch the two versions together, you'll see it. Also, the sound is considerably lower in volume on the widescreen version, and seems less full-bodied than other DVD's. I could be wrong about that, but that's the way it seems on my system.<br /><br />As far as the extra features on the second disc, they contain many memories of the production and great tributes paid to Hill by the actors, along with writer David Ward. Ward is especially interesting as he discusses how he was drawn to write a script about confidence men and how he structured the film, balancing the mechanics of conning Lonnegan with conning us. So, all in all, the second, widescreen DVD has some improvements over the previous DVD, plus the extras; but, if you want to see the film the way it was released in theatres back in 1973, watch the first version or the new reissue.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith

Let me just say this. Without a doubt, this is one of the best Blu Ray Releases Ever! The quality of the transfer is amazing! My eyes where glued to the screen the entire 2 hours and 37 minutes..I noticed things in this movie that I had ever even noticed before in the DVD Versions. Specifically when they are inside the complex. Of course the space scences are mind blowing as well. This just goes to show that when the studio takes the time to totally remaster and do the transfer right, the results are stunning! I wish other older movies would get this kind of treatment!<br /><br />As far as special features there really are none, so I will just keep my Bonus Disc from the 2 Disc DVD Version.<br /><br />Of course if you buy the entire anthology blu ray you will get all the special features, but for me, ALIENS is really the only movie I care about of the 4 that where released. So this release was a perfect buy for me. I got it on sale at Target for only $9.99!

 | product/productId: 0790734060 | review/userId: A33GI2W23NILOT | review/summary: An Engrossing Classic | review/text: I fell in love with this movie when I first experienced it in the fifth grade.  Now an adult, I can appreciate it all the more.  A powerful depiction of one of history's most fascinating characters, Amadeus is a film you'll return to over and over again.  <p>The cast is well chosen, although you may find the hit and miss accents bothersome if you're a stickler for authenticity.  (However I find that most people are drawn so deeply into the drama that they find it easy to engage in suspension of disbelief as far as things such as this are concerned).  Portrayals of Emperor Joseph and his court sidekicks are entertaining, if a bit superficial (though I don't think it detracts from the story).  F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is superb; I have yet to see him equal this performance in any of his subsequent roles.  Tom Hulce's Mozart elicits disgust, wonder, pity- much the same as we might have endured had we known the man himself.  If you've studied what is known of his life, you are aware of the fact that Mozart was the possessor of pure genius coupled with an anything but pure propensity toward the foul and obscene.  His dirty riddles revile but his musical compositions astound- precisely the picture painted of him in Amadeus.  In this sense, the film is accurate indeed.<p>Yet it is important to remember that this is a fictional, theoretical story, not a biography.  Although they were contemporaries and competitors professionally, it is difficult to substantiate further details about the relationship between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Mozart.  If you go searching, you'll find conflicting information: that Salieri did claim, during his latter days in an asylum, to have killed Mozart, that Mozart accused Salieri of trying to poison him, that the two were mutually appreciative of each other's talent and bore no ill-will toward one another.  Most modern scholars seem to have adopted the latter view.  However I have read that the intriguing circumstances surrounding the anonymous commission of Mozart's unfinished Requiem are authentic.<p>Historic accuracy issues aside, this is an all time great film.  It will engross you and leave you exhausted.  Excellent renditions of Mozart's music are skillfully and seamlessly woven into the plot and heighten the drama. The climactic Salieri-assisted Requiem composition scene is a powerful and unforgettable classic of cinematic brilliance.  I cannot recommend Amadeus nearly enough.  In fact, just writing this review has given me the desire to watch it yet again...
 | product/productId: 5559578622 | review/userId: A3ST3JWT4DLDZC | review/summary: Very bad idea... | review/text: Two things pushed me to watch this movie almost against my will: Is from the Calder&oacute;n Stell brothers and I wanted to see if I could find all the ''vedettes'' on screen after reading their names on the credits.<br /><br />From the 11 movies that Montenegro and Rivero made together, there's one where she pretends to be a man, so it was his turn now to do the opposite.<br />To make Rivero sign the contract someone surely told him that this would be a comedy in the style of UNA EVA Y DOS ADANES (Some like it hot), but check this out and tell me if this is a good idea:<br /><br />1- With those huge muscles, Rivero has bone marrow cancer and has seen several specialists, who had told him the same, no cure.<br /><br />2- His mother is catholic, so he can not commit suicide because that would kill her too, losing her son and thinking he was going to hell it was just too much.<br /><br />3- He decides to hire someone to kill him by surprise, and that way he won't even feel it.<br /><br />4- Just seconds after signing the contract with the assassins, arriving at home, the phone is ringing and is one of the doctors telling him they were ALL WRONG, ALL OF THEM!!! He is not going to die after all...Is that even believable?<br /><br />5- He can not undo the killing thing, so gets his friend (Incl&aacute;n) and move to another apartment DRESSED AS WOMEN until the hired assassins forget the whole deal when they never find him.<br /><br />6- A slutty neighbor sees them moving in and quickly calls Montenegro so she can hire Rivero as her personal assistant. Montenegro likes them big and manly.<br /><br />7- MU&Ntilde;ECAS DE MEDIANOCHE, is the place where Montenegro performs a couple numbers. Here is where the flesh showing, the dancing and the drinking begins.<br /><br />8- LA CORCHOLATA shows up, along with Isela Vega, Caballo Rojas, Andr&eacute;s Garc&iacute;a playing himself, Manuel loco Vald&eacute;s (in love with Incl&aacute;n in drag), la creme de la creme.<br /><br />9- Rivero falls in love with, wanna guess? Montenegro! (her name here is GINA MONTESCO, just like Gina Montes, the brazilian vedette, who is also there) and everything starts to get complicated when the assassin shows up as one of Montenegro's ''friend''.<br /><br />10- Another asian-looking 'vedette'' is there and is not Lyn Mai, maybe she had BETTER things to do... really? In the end I didn't find all the vedettes I was looking for but found out Rivero and Incl&aacute;n's costume designer was MITZI! Yes, Thal&iacute;as Mitzi... (I think he was jealous and that's why he made those horrible dresses) unbelievable!

While I'm not a top anime fan, I thought I'd see what I thought.<p>It's actually a refreshing kind of treatment, (though I have to tweak the plot -- lots of people dying and only now someone's looking into it?  Perhaps that's a Japanese supposition about the British, but it doesn't really fly.)  I enjoyed the characters and most of the scenes.  My only real problem is I didn't see any other episodes around here or in the stores -- these sort of characters would be interesting in multiple types of situations, especially with the sexual tension going on.  <p>And as I said, my hubby watched it the next day and thought it was a riot.  He usually doesn't like the anime and movies I like (I tend to like comedic, scifi and fantasy), so it must have something going on.
 | product/productId: 0790731894 | review/userId: A2KG8WLR1AKO12 | review/summary: Did real life terrorists get some ideas from this film? | review/text: It is ironic that after 9/11 Hollywood shies away from directly dealing with Islamic terrorism. So much so, that the very recently released The Sum of All Fears based on Tom Clancy's novel changes the identity of the evil doers from fervent Islamicists to ultra right-wing Nazis. The earlier Executive Decision was filmed in 1996. It addresses forthrightly, without fear of politically correct reprisals, the menace of Islamic radicalism. A few scenes even have the terrorists speaking Arabic to each other. In many ways, Executive Decision, warned us about the possibility of the attacks of 9/11. The actor who primarily makes this film work is David Suchet who portrays the diabolical Nagi Hassan, a dedicated Islamicist who hates the United States with an unrelenting passion. He ultimately plans to use a hijacked airplane as something of a heavy duty bomb to murder millions of American citizens. This fiendish individual is committed to sacrifice his own life, but hides the final aspect of the scheme from his fellow terrorists. The latter believe that they are merely participating in a plot to free a fellow Islamic radical. Hassan fails to inform them that they are on a suicidal mission. Does this not remind one of the hijackers of 9/11? Osama bin Ladin also did not tell most of those 19 hijackers that they were going to die on that fateful day.<p>What about Kurt Russell, Steven Segal, Halle Barry, and the other very fine performers? I will be blunt: the primary focus should be on the Nagi Hassan character. It is a very accurate depiction of the extremist Islamic terrorist mindset. Did the fast paced action thriller Executive Decision unwittingly provide a few ideas to those Islamic radicals who almost certainly viewed this film? The answer must be a reluctant yes. Should anyone therefore involved in the production of Executive Decision feel guilty? Not in the least. Artists usually cannot be blamed if the malevolent inclined interpret their work in a manner not to their liking. This is a must see movie. The Nagi Hassans are not merely the figment of a creative writer's imagination, but real live threats to our American values and freedoms. Executive Decision earns five stars.

It was the first movie that I purchased to begin my film collection and it deserves more than a fair mention. I always check it out , , when it comes on television as well. Somehow , certain scenes have been shot differently and some dialog changed , for the televised version. I'm not referring to "dubbed" lines , either.

Moreover,  brilliant directing , brilliant cinematography , superb editing and dedicated performances , make this film an astounding, heart felt and well deserved , winner of 5 Academy Awards , including Best Picture. This is definately a film that I recommend for anyone who appreciates the above mentioned criteria. Lots of action  , evens the emotional keels and will satisfy the action/adventure fan , as well. Mel Gibson portays Scottish Rebel , William Wallace and the film chronicles his violent rebellion against, the unforgiving and blood thristy, rule of England. Great supporting performances from Brian Cox ,Sean Mcginnley , Patrick Mcgoohan ,Brendan Gleeson, Catherine McCormack, James Cosmo , and newcomer David O'Hara as the unforgettable character , Stephen.

This movie follows some of Hitchcock's other great classics such as "Rear Window," and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" which make them look as if they were Hitchcock's beginning movies.<br /> Instead of using a large budget and Technicolor, Hitchcock decided to take a different approach with this movie. He wanted the movie to be filmed in black and white even though color movies had been out for some time now. At first I thought that because the movie was in black and white that it would be uninspiring and dull but it actually made the picture better. Having it be filmed that way makes the movie scarier. It is always dark and gloomy so it puts you in that mood where you are ready to be frightened.  Hitchcock also did this movie on a very low budget with only $800,000 dollars to spend. With the little amount of money he had he did a wonderful job with all of the camera shots and angles that it looks like he spent tons of money and quality time while making "Psycho."<br /> The movie starts out with Marian Crane played by Janet Leigh and Sam Loomis played by John Gavin in a cheap motel on their lunch break talking about how they want to be together but they can't  for money reasons. Marian is able to steal money from her job and drives off to surprise her lover. She stops at a motel one night while on her way but because it was getting late she decided to stop and this is where the real story begins. You think that you are watching a movie about one thing and the next minute the plot of the movie changes before your eye. The whole time that you are watching the movie you are always unsure of what is going to happen and it keeps you guessing right up to the very end unlike some of the movies that are out now.<br /> You would think that since this movie was made in 1959 that it would not be the least bit scary but it turns out to be one of the scariest movies of all time. What makes the movie so scary is the music. The music in this movie is absolutely astonishing. There is music playing throughout most of the movie and the way they placed the music in each scene makes the movie that much better. Right when something is going to happen the music gets a little louder or it suddenly changes. Suspense is also another factor that makes this movie chilling. You never know exactly when something bad is going to happen or if someone is going to attack so you are left gripping on to your seat until something unusual happens.<br /> Another great feature about "Psycho" is the acting. All of the actors in the movie do a really great job portraying who they are playing.  None of them every look like they are acting. They make it look so real and that is one of the supreme effects of this movie. You feel like you are watching a documentary on a murderer who is being taped and you<br />Just want them to stop.<br /> "Psycho" is a movie that I went into a little bit hesitant but after seeing it I truly do believe that this movie is brilliant. This movie is for people who like suspense and love to be scared. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is sick and tired of seeing all the new horror films out that make you yawn. This movie is exciting, suspenseful and makes you want to go out and see all of the other films that Hitchcock directed.

I fell in love with this movie instantly. Why this film had a limited release is questionable. Movies like Titanic make over a billion dollars at the box office with  terrible dialog and character development, when a wonderful little film  like Dogfight makes fewer than 500,000 dollars.  To a true film lover this  is a crime.  Unfortunately the public rather see films like Titanic,  instead of a good quality film like Dogfight.  Dogfight proved that you do  not need a big budget to make a good film.  Lili Taylor and River Phoenix  do an excellent job in this film.  I could not even pick a favorite scene,  because the move is loaded with them. I find that a lot of video rental  stores do not even offer it, but they sure got enough copies of Titanic to  please, so I suggest buying it. Dogfight is well worth the money.

He's not so into Elmo and Sesame Street anymore.  He loves trucks, tractors, or anything else with Big Wheels.  He constantly askes to watch this video, and he actually does.  He's started saying "I wanna ride in Daddy's Tonka truck".  I hope they create additional DVD's as good as this one!

 | product/productId: 0783227809 | review/userId: A5TJ89W5CXRQN | review/summary: music is life | review/text: I have The Blues Brothers DVD and CD soundtrack<br /><br />along with the VHS BB 2000 and CD-Gimme Some Lovin'<br /><br />I prefer the sequal to the original but I wouldn't have one without the other. The original I just had to have in my inventory because of John Belushi.<br /><br />At first I didn't think I'd like BB 2000 much but John Goodman's performance was tops; the best replacement for Belushi.<br /><br />The music was fantastic [Cab Calloway-Minnie the Moocher/Aretha Franklin, Think and the song Sweet Home Chicago]<br /><br />The stunts with the cars had me laughing [I've a quirky sense of humor] I am from Illinois and laugh at certain types of authoritarian stupidity.<br /><br />If you're a blues fan musically, you just might enjoy this production. It's not the greatest story ever told but it does represent a moment in time. If all you want to do is enjoy watching without being a critic, this just might be as enjoyable to you as it is for me. I love it.<br /><br />If Dan Aykroyd decides to make a 3rd movie for the Blues Brothers, I'll buy it. Some of the great artists have passed: it's a treat to see them as though they were still with us, providing the great music of their life.

 | product/productId: 0790738066 | review/userId: A21EZ3M5XP4A6O | review/summary: Really not so bad after all | review/text: I'm being a little generous here (really 3 1/2 stars), but critics obviously had it out for Costner on this film, regardless of its merits. I don't consider myself a Costner fan, but this film is perfectly  entertaining and I never found it dull. The script is laughable in spots,  the acting lukewarm, and the patriotic leanings are definitely &quot;aw  shucks&quot; (very Costner!), but overall The Postman succeeds as a  perfectly watchable epic. I liked Will Patton's ruthless General Bethlehem  a lot -- he succeeds as a loathsome, megalomaniacal villain. This movie is  actually better than Waterworld, Costner's other post-apocalyptic film.

Image Entertainment is distributing four feature length titles edited down to about 90 minutes from the original four hour serial length.  Zippy plots, lots of action, clever sets and surprisingly strong scripts do justice to "THE PERIL FROM OUTER SPACE," "THE PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE," "SPACE SHIP TO THE UNKNOWN" and "THE DEADLY RAY FROM MARS."  <p>Larry "Buster" Crabbe is charismatic and strangely beautiful as the lead in this beguiling comic book space opera from the late 30s.  <p>For die hard fans of this series, the full length, uncut serial "FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE" is also available.

You will either identify with her a lot, or you'll wish you could.<br /><br />Lesley was perfect for this film ,and her "lovers" were all very charismatic. The plot is very busy and never dull. The whole cast was great. It's one of those films that seemed destined to "fit" and come to life. Original and a real blast.

 | product/productId: 630027179X | review/userId: A3JM2U8EONZZL7 | review/summary: Not Perfect, But About as Definitive As It Gets | review/text: It's tough to compress the 900-some-odd pages of text that Thomas Malory used to tell his story of Le Morte d'Arthur into 140 minutes of film, but director John Boorman and screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg give it a good  shot.  While it sometimes leaves out important details or compresses events  in the interest of time, it can never be accused of playing fast and loose  with the legend.  However, the film also requires a bit of work on the part  of the viewer to fill in some of the details, and it's obvious Boorman  expects his viewer to be at least passing familiar with the traditions of  the Arthurian legend (anyone unfamiliar with Arthur's fate after his death,  for example, will be baffled by the film's final shot).  So brush up just a  bit before you sit down to this one.<p>With its darkened, cloud-streaked  skies, lonely stone castles, eerie green lighting, (all caught in beautiful  widescreen glory on the DVD), and effective use of the music of Richard  Wagner, you won't find a moodier, more beautifully shot film.  In fact,  there are some downright breathtaking cinematic moments in this film, none  more so than when Perceval hurls Excalibur back into the water, and  Wagner's music swells just in time for the Lady of the Lake to make a  dramatic clean catch.  Great stuff.<p>It also helps that Nicol Williamson  turns in a very game performance as Merlin, but it's Nigel Terry who  carries the film in an underappreciated but wholly believeable  interpretation of King Arthur.  Terry leaves the scenery-chewing to  Williamson, and anchors the film instead with a steady, understated  performance.  Look also for stars-in-the-making Liam Neeson as the jealous  Gawain, and Patrick Stewart as Guenevere's father, Leodegrance.<p>EXCALIBUR  has all the elements one expects in a fantasy, yet, in a sense, Boorman  does for the sword-and-sorcery film what Sergio Leone did for the western:  whereas prior horse operas showed cowboys riding across the desert and  shuffing down dirt streets without a bit of sweat, and firing pistols that  never drew blood, Leone made everyone look hot and sweaty, and showed that  a Smith &amp; Wesson could rip a real hole through your gut.  Boorman does  the same for the knight in this film -- knights clunk around clumsily in  heavy armor, get skewered on pikes, get their heads bashed in, and cough  their guts out in bloody mud puddles.  It all lends an air of veracity to  the film that makes it all seem like It Could Really Have Happened This  Way.<p>The widescreen format available on DVD gives this film the weight  and heft it has long deserved, and there are some real gems lurking among  the additional features -- including a surprisingly cheezy, Grade B  trailer, and a really great alternate soundtrack in which director John  Boorman discusses the action and shares some behind-the-scene goodies (such  as the fact that Nicol Williamson and Helen Mirren couldn't stand each  other, or that the actor playing the grown-up Mordred was actually a  first-rate horseman).<p>Give this one a try.

Eddie Murphy is one talented man playing all those roles of the Cletus family plus Buddy Love.

This one uses a multi-joke formula all the way to success.
 | product/productId: 080012166X | review/userId: A3MKON3VM0W1TH | review/summary: A Very Good Version Of The Story | review/text: Anyone that has read the book and then seen any of the many films based on it realizes that there is no such thing as a definitive film version.  Perhaps the style of the book prevents more of a literal film.<br /><br />But the book remains the taking-off point for a director's interpretation of the story.  As for me, any film that can capture some of the mood of the book is valid.  Each generation seems to have a need to tell the story on film, and each one will be different.<br /><br />This version does capture the essence of the book.  Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of van Helsing as an eccentric seems to me to be very fitting.  Could an expert in such things be really 'normal' himself?<br /><br />This film also deals with the sexual undertones of the book quite well.  Count Dracula is much more than a monster that sucks blood.  He is a tempter, something forbidden, hence even though a 'monster', holds a great deal of attraction.  Most films emphasize this underlying sexuality more than the book, for in the book Dracula is not portrayed as a handsome Count from Eastern Europe at all.<br /><br />So the book will always exist at a different level than any film based on it.  Perhaps the inherent differences between the visual medium of film and the written word of a book accounts for most of this.  But this film is very good, really takes us into a glimpse of the darkside.  Recommended!
 | product/productId: 6300216748 | review/userId: A1C00OE3W67XE | review/summary: to the writer of the review entitled "an especially prescient film" | review/text: The many toubled, undemocratic areas of Africa don't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the United States is destroyed.  Whether or not he actually had the capability to do so, the leader of Iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability.  But thanks for commenting.<br /><br />As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it.  I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary.  Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better.

 | product/productId: 0788812440 | review/userId: A2OSOFI0NVCGOA | review/summary: Hypo(or is it Hyper?)-criticism in the Disney studios | review/text: This is a nice glimpse of what Disney passed as a &quot;feature&quot; during and after the war, and it shows a willingness by whoever's in charge of the Disney studios to be faithful to Disney's original intentions(it would have been easy for the money men to chop up this feature, &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;, &quot;Salugos Amigos&quot; and other collections, bundle them up with other shorts and release them separately).<p> BUT...<p> That honour only goes so far! They're willing to reissue a feature as Walt originally intended, but that feature has been &quot;edited for content&quot;(as the green screen at the beginning of the feature says). And it's not just &quot;Melody Time&quot;; &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; and others all carry that familiar distinction.<p> Why do they persist in &quot;homogenizing&quot;(for lack of a better word)Disney's classic works, while the modern studios are going full force in what they're censoring from the past? I mean, they take out a few seconds worth of Pecos Bill's cigarette, but the old lady character from &quot;Atlantis&quot; smokes like a chimney!<p> This says to me that there are too many cooks in the kitchen; doesn't everyone wish that there was someone who could be the strong head of Disney the way Walt was? Overseeing everything from story construction in animated features to the foundation and expansion of Disneyland, all without missing a step?

The action is great, and while it does tend to get carried away sometimes (not helped By Richard Donner's frenetic pacing), it's still the most fun of the franchise, and one of the best action films of the 80's.<p>Mel is great in one of his first major film roles, and Glover works well with Gibson. Director Donner, who gave us Superman (1978), directed all the Weapon films, but this one is the undisputed finest. Action at it's most excellent.
 | product/productId: 0790734834 | review/userId: A1B22L23YH8CDW | review/summary: One of the Best Films of the 90's and Classic Film Noir | review/text: One of the tautest films ever made, LA Confidential is a film that needs to be seen a few times for the viewer to fully comprehend it.  A bathroom break during the film will leave you clueless.  This is not to say you won't like it after the first viewing.  On the contrary, you'll have a general grasp of the stories in this multi-layered film and appreciate its screenplay and mysterious twists and turns, which make you think and want to see it over again to fill in the minute details instrumental in linking the stories and triggering the actions of the three main characters played by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />Set in 1951 LA, this film shows LA in its glamorous faade.  Unlike other film noirs, naturalistic lighting is employed to contrast against the dark side of the setting.  Crowe, who steals the film and first served notice as a major player, plays a not-too-bright thug with a soft side.  Shocking Australians with his enormous performance, Pearce, a former Aussie soap star, plays a politically ambitious police officer who discovers honesty does not serve him best.  And as always, Kevin Spacey delivers a top-notch performance through an unconventional interpretation of his character, Jack Vincennes, a morally bankrupt vice squad sergeant, who is able to live fashionably from his side-job as consultant to a TV detective show and snitch to a sleazoid "Confidential"-like tabloid publisher played by Danny DeVito.  Add to this mix a morally ambiguous cop played by James Cromwell, a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute (Kim Basinger) and her millionaire pimp (David Straithairn), and you have intriguing stories that are intricately yet delicately woven together to create a larger story.<p>The film starts off with a narration of LA the way it used to be:  a land of milk and honey that was gold to gangsters.  The primo gangster has been arrested for tax evasion and other wannabes are trying to take over the throne.  Main candidates for this position have been murdered and it's anybody's guess who the successor will be.  A Christmas-night riot erupts in the police precinct, instigated by the police officers who try to punish Mexican suspects for a colleague's beating (one could see why the police is distrusted by people of color after seeing this film).  A reporter takes photos and they are published on the front page.  Someone has to take the fall.  Ed Exley (Pearce) who tried to end the riot willingly volunteers as witness in return for promotion to lieutenant detective.  The fall guy turns out to be Bud White (Crowe)'s partner who was just a year shy of eligibility for his pension.  He is soon found murdered in a 24-hour caf&eacute; along with two women and several men.  One of the women is a prostitute cut to look like Rita Hayworth, a friend of a woman Bud White encountered the night before, Lynn Bracken (Basinger), who was in the company of their pimp and an ex-cop named Meeks.  As a loyal friend of his dead partner, White seeks to find the killers.  Exley takes interest in the case to further his career.  Vincennes indirectly becomes involved later when his conscience catches up with him and tries to do good.  Their respective cases, it turns out, are linked to 25 pounds of stolen heroin.<p>The performances are superb and it was too bad neither Crowe nor Pearce were nominated for awards.  The fact that they were no-names may have been the reason.  Basinger finally got her due that year but I feel Julianne Moore was more deserving of the supporting Oscar for "Boogie Nights" since she had a more challenging role.  And as good as "Titanic" was, this film was artistically superior despite its small scale.  On the DVD you'll see screen tests of Crowe and Pearce and interviews with Curtis Hanson, the director, James Ellroy, on whose novels the film is based, and Kim Basinger.  The film is fast-paced and keeps you guessing.  No one is what they seem is the theme, which is appropo to the backdrop of superficial tinsel town.  Watch this film knowing that you won't have distractions and knowing that you can focus for two and a half hours.<p>P.S.:  There are several historical errors in this film.  The film "Roman Holiday" Lynn and Bud watch was not made and released until 1954.  And Lana Turner became involved with Johnny Stompanato after 1951.
 | product/productId: 6300181421 | review/userId: A1Y3XDYV4CRRK | review/summary: Puts other special effects to shame | review/text: .<br />...Rather than repeat all of the excellent reviews... I am going to address just one aspect of this brilliant film... the special effects...<br /><br />...Having been in two wars, I know what real explosions look like.  I know that grenades do not throw men thirty feet into the air... when you throw one into a bamboo hut it does not look like a 55 gallon drum of gasoline was just detonated...<br />Take... say... a 60 mm mortar round... the explosion is mostly explosive and dirt... only the briefest glimpse of flame...<br /><br />...But some hack special effects types started using insane amounts of gasoline... then directors decided that they liked it and forced good special effects men to go for larger and larger amounts of gasoline...<br /><br />...But All Quiet on the Western Front... does not prostitute itself that way.  Many of the special effects crew had been in the trenches and knew exactly what it looked like... If you know what to look for you can spot effects from a French 75 up to a major seige gun... and no gasoline...<br /><br />...The greatest special effect is during the French charge almost to the lip of the German trenches... and the German siege guns (battleship type weapons and larger) lay down a "barrage" (original meaning... barrier) between the trenches and the charging infantry.<br /><br />...While some license is taken... guns that heavy never deliberately targeted within a hundred meters of friendly lines... the effect is staggering... Up to that moment the charging troops are throwing their bodies against metal... chopped down in endless rows by machine guns... torn asunder and made part of the soil by artillery...  But the explosions from the "heavies" between the French and the Germans... are gigantic... they tower over the battlefield like nothing from the hand of man... but rather more like titanic explosions delivered from the sky by iron gods...  Mere flesh... no matter how insanely brave... has to draw the line there...<br /><br />...These days when I see the sloppy special effects work demanded by directors... I want to lock them in a room with a copy of that scene and not let them out until they understand just how much they have been shoving drek on us...<br />.
 | product/productId: 6300184951 | review/userId: A31I3HXMD5H1EL | review/summary: First Stewart/Mann Teaming a CLASSIC! | review/text: Winchester '73 is one of the most enduring and popular films of James Stewart's career, for several reasons; it was the first of five teamings with brilliant, underrated director Anthony Mann, who retooled Stewart's drawling, 'aw-shucks' persona into a laconic, edgier, more flawed hero; it featured a brilliant cast, including Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, John McIntyre, and, in VERY early appearances, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis; visually, it is spectacular, one of the most beautiful Black and White films ever made, with deep-focus photography highlighting rugged Arizona settings that literally leap from the screen; and, most of all, it is a terrific variation of 'Cain and Abel', told through the premise of the search for a 'one-of-a-kind' rifle Stewart wins in a competition, then loses through treachery. It's the kind of film that offers new insights each time you view it, as the actions and motivations of 'good' brother Stewart and 'bad' brother McNally become better understood.<p>What truly makes this DVD an 'essential', though, is the bonus track...Described as an 'interview' with Stewart, it is actually an audio commentary that runs through the film, offering not only his reflections about the making of Winchester '73, but insights about his career, working with John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, and his great friends Henry Fonda and John Wayne, even a nice story about his long-time mount, Pie. Recorded several years ago for the laserdisc edition of Winchester '73, it provides a rare opportunity to hear a screen legend reminisce (and makes you wish Wayne and Fonda had lived long enough to have offered personal observations about THEIR classic films!)<p>This is a DVD NOT to be missed!
 | product/productId: 0783219857 | review/userId: A3GLGPXYO2S10B | review/summary: its Waterworld! | review/text: Ok, so I assume that if you are reading this review you either don't know what the movie is or you have heard of it and are looking for other opinions.  This movie was hyped up to be a blockbuster smash with, at its time, the largest movie budget ever.  It got bad reviews and didn't do well at the box office.  It has since turned into a cult classic and is now on HD DVD.  HD is dead pretty much by now but people are still buying what is left out there.<br /><br />This movie has a cool theme based around the polar ice caps melting and covering the world in water.  People are trying to survive and one has even evolved.  Enter the main character, the Mariner.  You follow him through his adventure of trying to save his own skin but ends up helping in the quest for dry land.<br /><br />The picture quality is very clean and clear.  If you are a fan of the movie or want to check it out I recommend it highly despite its poor beginning back in 1995.
 | product/productId: 0790748215 | review/userId: A2582KMXLK2P06 | review/summary: house of terror for everyone, including the viewers | review/text: House on Haunted Hill tells the story of a professional prankster who owns a haunted house and takes in a group of people. He tells each of them they can win 1 million bucks if they're able to survive the night in his house of terrors.<br /><br />Now the entire group goes in completely knowing about the mans special talent for pulling exceptionally terrifying pranks and the after effects they have on people, but arrogantly, everyone in the group easily accepts the invitation to spend the night there (well, except for that one nerdy guy, of course).<br /><br />Little do they know the house is actually REALLY haunted with unexplainable paranormal activity. Even the prankster isn't aware of it either.<br /><br />I DID have one small problem with the storyline- all three of the women in the group were really arrogant and hard to take seriously as a result because they came off looking like a bunch of phonies (not to mention the overkill factor in having all three women basically act the same exact way).  I was originally thinking about deducting one point from the overall score, but then I kept watching the film and got so caught up in the storyline and the amazing special paranormal effects that dominated the second half of the movie that I decided *not* to lower the rating.<br /><br />There are small twists to the characters that eventually unravel, and their unexpected "cahoots" so to speak, which ended up being an extra factor in determining my final (positive) thoughts on the film.<br /><br />Anyway, what starts off like a simple game of "Who did it?" Scooby-Doo like mystery eventually turns MUCH more frightening. The special effects pertaining to shadows, walking dark demonic figures lurking in the walls, and ghost activity being seen on the video camera did a REALLY good job getting to me and totally freaking me out! I loved it! There's one scene that took place underwater involving a female demon and her sudden transformation that really scared the heck out of me!<br /><br />Overall, this is one really great movie. Terrifying during the second half, but a light atmosphere building up to something big during the first half. That's what you can expect.

 | product/productId: 6301802381 | review/userId: A2LTD0HWYWF5N5 | review/summary: 50's "B" movie fun! | review/text: All three of these fall into the "So bad they're Good" catagory. "Attack" is my favorite of the three, the one I really bought the set for. Truly awful special effects (even by that era's standards) and a story that makes absolutely no sense (The Giant Alien apparently brings Allison Hayes home after they're encounter in the desert-- only how in the Hell did he know where she lived?) only add to the fun. "Behemoth" was actually quite good,though it pales in comparison to the classic "Beast from 20,000 Fathoms", which it is often compared to. As for "Queen"-- well,let's just say I watched it once, and then put it back in its case, never to be seen again!

I've seen it three times in the last month since we got the DVD, and I'm surprised to say I really like it.  I'm not big on musical comedies, but this one works.  It's pretty risque for 1953, and the musical numbers are great.  "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love?" Jane Russell's big number, is gayer than a Christmas tree, and "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" is one of Marilyn's finest moments.  She's absolutely radiant throughout this movie, and very funny too.  Her talents were overshadowed by her looks, and this is her best performance in my opinion.  The film print has been restored, and looks great, I love  Technicolor movies from this period.  You can't go wrong with this one.

That's a movie? | review/text: "A Star is Born" is still one of my favorite films. But do we really need restored scenes with lines like "stop the car here a minute" that aren't all that important to the main plot which is already long enough? If these are restored scenes, make them filmed scenes instead of black and white photos. Be warned that "Lost Horizon" is restored like this, too.  I do feel the shortened version kept the plot from flowing into all sorts of strange tangents, like the tropical fruit song filmed for a TV commercial and the feuds of alcoholic Norman Maines(Mason) with guards, police, etc. Jack Warner himself signed a contract for a script under 125 pages, with an option to edit out unneeded parts "as junk."  This restored version is altering history Orwell-style. At least make the short version available for viewers to compare.

 | product/productId: 1563644312 | review/userId: A3A3490HHAZIB2 | review/summary: How still we see thy satellite news reports... | review/text: With excellent British understatement and subtle humour, Bethlehem Year Zero presents the Christmas Story in a modern context, bringing new insights to what you thought was a familiar tale.  The details remain historically accurate while being presented as contemporary breaking news.  Three diplomats from the East, for instance, arrive in Mercedes Limosines, and King Herod's Special Intelligence Forces carry out his instructions of Matthew 2:16.  The storyline is presented as a series of fifteen-minute news reports in CNN or Nightline style, and presented in such a way that both devout Christians and confirmed atheists will enjoy it without finding any part of it offensive or patronizing.
 | product/productId: 630120879X | review/userId: A2LB6R45RM7NMN | review/summary: Campy Chessy Classic | review/text: First off, if you don't like horror movies, or just 80's movies in general, you're not going to like this one at all.  But if you do, you MUST see this, becuase it is essential to any horror buff's collection.  The plot centers around an Anytown,USA type place that suddenly has a local Waxwork mueseum.  While walking to school Deborah Foreman and Michelle Johnson are invited to a private showing of the waxwork by the owner himself.  Thus, the girls invite Zach Galligan and a few other friends from college to come along.  It turns out that the waxwork specializes in murder scenes, and if you get close enough to an exhibit, you will be transformed into its world.  That is how Dana Ashbrook meets and becomes a wolfman,and how Michelle Johnson gets a kiss from Dracula.  Other classic villains shown; Marquis De Sade, the Mummy, and some zombies a la Night of the Living Dead.  It is up to Zach Galligan to unearth some secrets about his family that will help him destroy the Waxwork and its evil owner.  My favorite aspects of this movie:  the fact that it is made in the 80's, giving it an automatic layer of cheese...Deborah Foreman's performance, as the stereotypical &quot;nice girl,&quot; (though her character in April Fool's Day was much more convincing and entertaining)...and the way the director not only pays homage to horror classic, but also the way he pokes fun at it.  I'm not completely sure he did this on purpose, but certain scenes involving Dana Ashbrook's character and the local sherriff suggest that the tone of the film was meant to be both comedic and horrific.  Even though the movie is not completely brilliant or polished, it still provides entertainment to a certain audience who typically enjoys these kinds of flicks.  P.S. Don't bother with the sequel.

 | product/productId: 0790744945 | review/userId: AIY4H4KWR2KWZ | review/summary: Shocked At The Genuine Chemistry | review/text: This came up as a queue suggestion based on previous rentals, so I admit to being very surprised. There's no way I would've randomly chosen to screen this film, none. Primarily because of the cast - more specifically the female lead. And like so many questionable casting decisions which, not only raise eyebrows, but typically equate to box office demise, the pairing of Jimmy Cagney and Bette Davis is fairly pronounced considering their differing personalities and respective careers.<br /><br />Like him or not, when you order Cagney, you know more or less what you're getting. The chance element for me was putting money down on Ms. Davis - I'm not at all a fan, so that was a huge personal red flag.<br /><br />But curiosity got the better of me and I'm stunned to say that I truly enjoyed the film. This is a genuinely fun romantic adventure, not quite '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GUYAZY">It Happened One Night</a>', but very good nonetheless.<br /><br />Not surprised the see the Brothers Epstein (Julius & Irving) of 'Casablanca' fame having put their magic touch to the script.<br /><br />Again, I'm shocked at the genuine chemistry between the two leads. Ms. Davis acted her role to near perfection. I'm so used to her cool, enigmatic and potentially malevolent performances, that her turn at an ingenue was refreshing to say the least. Her spirited, and dare I say it, sexy energy really came through. Wow. :-D<br /><br />I had absolutely no idea she could do this type of work. And I'm sad to note that after watching this film, I spent quite a bit of time and effort into looking into her earlier works in the hopes of recapturing the magic of this performance - there are none. As far as I can tell, 'Bride' was singularly unique; the only time Davis actually played the sweet spunky young woman caught up in the romance of adventure and high spirit.<br /><br />As I originally feared, the bulk of her career was formed around a harsh core of cynicism and deviousness. Of course I will always appreciate her skill at doing those characters; we all need the great dark personas in order to truly craft excellence in film - without the dark you can never understand and appreciate the light. But it seems like she lost something along the way, her 'Joan Winfield' character hints at a career that might've been fascinating and entertaining on a completely different path.<br /><br />'Bride' is a genuinely fun romantic comedy - and if you enjoyed 'It Happened' - you'll enjoy this fun film.  &lt;nod><br /><br />Movie Rant: How pathetic is it that today's filmmakers have lost this storytelling ability?<br /><br />I've given up hope that the cookie-cutter film school grads being pushed out today, like so many strands of smelly Play-Doh, can recreate this kind of flick. At this juncture, I no longer care if they do a complete and total ripoff -  plot, screenplay, script, set design, lighting, cinematography, character names - just redo the whole shebang and slap your name onto the project. I just want a modern version of this kind of film with today's stars. Had such high hopes for 'The Bounty Hunter', especially with the always enjoyable Gerard Butler as the grungy male lead. That should've been an easy slam dunk, but...<br /><br />There seems to be some kind of massive brain-lock across the industry when it comes to doing these types of productions anymore. My fear is that it's a generational defect. Like when you copy a copy, it's not quite as sharp. If you do it repeatedly, eventually what's produced is illegible. I believe we might be witnessing decades of sliding standards, a lowering of the bar - not just in films but culturally - we're experiencing the result of Idiocracy In Action.

Great addition to the collection of any die hard horror film addict. Certainly complements my Wes Craven collection!

 | product/productId: 6302098475 | review/userId: AJQB8RS0G6DC3 | review/summary: Best Robin Hood film in the past 50 years | review/text: A Robin Hood film with a talented lead, excellent supporting actors, and an actual feeling of "being there," this Robin Hood flick is simply fun.  Bergin is the perfect trickster-like Robin, Thurman is the first Marian with a spine and a brain in years, and the supporting cast populate a medieval England complete with mud and overcast skies.  The classic plot actually feels fresh, and while the final confrontation between Hood and Falconet might not match the Errol Flynn (nothing can), it definitely gives it a better run for the money than has been managed in a very long time.  The true genius of the castle invasion gives the film a trickster quality, and overall it has some of the best one-liners ever.  While not overtly/annoyingly political, it does manage to send a firm message whilst maintaining a great plot with a fine cast.  As Will Scarlet says, "Give me back my country!"
 | product/productId: 0767816234 | review/userId: A1HX00DL0SZM1G | review/summary: a guilty pleasure | review/text: One of the first movies that I picked up after buying my DVD player was  this guilty pleasure of a show that I had seen only a year earlier in the  theaters. Personally, any movie that sports a naked Denise Richards is a  pretty easy sell and the &quot;naughty&quot; nature of the movie is quite  distracting enough to ignore the plot holes that are simply gaping in this  example of plot twist on top of plot twist. For extra features the  commentary is just okay and the extras, well they emphasize that everything  of any substance was put in the theatrical run (ie they are short, very  short). It's hard to really give any plot information on this because to do  so would give away the stories many surprises, but suffice to say we are  dealing here with a concoction of scheming and counter scheming between an  interesting and diverse group of people in Florida. I heartily recommend a  purchase of this DVD.

I'm viewing on a 100" screen projected by a Marantz VP-11S2 and fully implimented surround system, all fully calibrated.  Yep it's brilliant.<br /><br />Still not quite the ultimate edition that I detail below, but probably the best we will get.<br /><br />The only remaining better way to experience Towering Inferno would be to watch the road show 70mm blow up version on a giant screen in a cavernous theatrical hall... Maybe one day I can privately hire the biggest screen I can find for a one off to recreate that experience of so many decades ago...<br /><br />Of course, until we see the next home video re-release in a home version of 4k digital cinema...<br /><br />***<br /><br />This is a pre-release review on the possible content of the Blu Ray...<br /><br />It has been suggested that this is the "Ultimate" home version of Towering Inferno.  Is it really...?<br /><br />As a fan of the film since it was first shown in the cinema in the seventies, I've been waiting for the "Ultimate" home version since home ownership of films started with Super 8mm film.<br /><br />Towering Inferno was first available for the home as 6 reel 8mm film digest version.  I still have a copy of that release as a rare collectors item.  I also have the complete John Williams soundtrack on LP record from the seventies.  Since then there has been multiple releases on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD.  I've owned some of these release except VHS.  Have these been "Ultimate" releases? No.<br /><br />Now comes the Blu ray version.  Will it be the "Ultimate" release?<br /><br />The "Ultimate" release would give the viewer the option to watch the regular 35mm scope version AND the 70mm blow-up roadshow version!  The 70mm roadshow version has some subtle differences in edits and soundtrack.  It also had an intermission at a cliff hanging moment.  I liked the music cues much more in the roadshow version and found the surround sound of 70mm version(called 6 track stereophonic upon theatrical release) much more emersive. (I think the 35mm scope version was only a mono track which was rechanelled to create stereo and weak surround for previous home versions).<br /><br />Let's hope this is Blu Rau really is the "Ultimate" edition and includes the 70mm roadshow version...if it is I'll give it 5+ stars!<br /><br />Cheers

Everything about this movie is just right: the story, the characters, the plot, the message, the animation, the voices, the humor, the suspense, the happy ending... You name the category and it's a winner.  Other rare wonderful features: Wow, a Disney flick where the mother doesn't get killed (or is long dead from the onset) and no dad or father figure outshines the actual kid hero?! Don Bluth's favorite neurosis, the evil late middle aged virago, is also absent.  The viewer is spared the RAS hymn-singing, as entertaining as it was. This leaves the stage free for a rollicking adventure starring one cool Steve-Irwin style kid and, of course, the world's two coolest mice detectives.  A must-see.

Every second, every one of them is practically bursting with comically exaggerated emotions (unintentionally comic, that is), foaming at the mouth, convulsed by kaleidoscopic and manic flashes of existential angst/despair/desire/frustration/rage/etc.  It's like watching a bunch of moths on PCP bouncing off the insides of a Mason jar.  Ah, the passion, the passion...  <p>(So THIS is what the Buddhists call &quot;the comedy of the ego.&quot;)<p>The film is kind of like a film version of Martin Amis' book, &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; which tells a story backwards.  Interesting gimmick/concept, but results in a barely watchable film, especially given the erratic and deliberately artsy-fartsy camera work (practically nauseating during the beginning of the film).

 | product/productId: 630197834X | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: A Great Tragic Romance | review/text: When pressed to name her favorite of her own films, Vivien Leigh brushed aside both GONE WITH THE WIND and STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE in favor of this now little-known film based on a failed 1930s stage drama of the same name: WATERLOO BRIDGE, directed by Mervyn LeRoy.  Leigh had good reason for her choice.  Although she was dazzling as Scarlett O'Hara and elegantly depraved as Blanche DuBois, she was never as beautifully photographed as she was in this 1940 film.<p>WATERLOO BRIDGE is perhaps best described as one of a number of films "with an English accent" that played to American sympathies for England in the years when England largely stood alone against Nazi Germany.  The story itself has a wartime setting: beautiful ballerina Myra (Vivien Leigh) meets and falls passionately in love with officer Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), only to be parted from him when he is called to duty during World War I.  Alone and increasingly destitute, she learns that he has been killed in action--and so, broken hearted and unconcerned for herself, she drifts into prostitution, plying the world's oldest profession along Waterloo Bridge... until she experiences a horrific twist of fate.<p>Although Robert Taylor is a bit miscast, Leigh carries the film with a truly remarkable performance.  In the opening portion of the scene, she is at the height of her youthful beauty, and cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg makes the most of it; later, when experience has hardened her, she turns the graceful charm of her earlier scenes upside down to create the bitter, brassy tart that Myra has become.  The cast also features an exceptional performance by Lucile Watson as Lady Margaret and notable turns by Maria Ouspenskaya, C. Aubrey Smith, and a host of others.<p>Although less well known than such tragic romances as Garbo's CAMILLE, WATERLOO BRIDGE is easily the equal of such and considerably better than most.  The romantic aura is powerful, the production values are meticulous, the direction, photography, and script are first rate.  And at the center of it all we have perhaps the single most beautiful actress of her era, Vivien Leigh, in one of her finest performances.  You'll need a box of tissues for this one; don't miss it.
 | product/productId: 1572525320 | review/userId: AH0K6KAO3N1RH | review/summary: Very Personal and Touching Film | review/text: Much has been said by many brilliant critics about this now-legendary film. It typically makes every reviewer's favorite movies of all-time list.<br />I'm not certain that I would go that far myself, but this is a very touching and elegantly done film. Jean Pierre Leaud is briliantly cast in the role of the main character. He's one of the big screen's best and unlikeliest heroes. You can't help but adore him and relate to him as you watch this movie. You also feel sorry for the young lad - he's trying hard to fit in and grow up normal, with his strange step-father who's more concerned with his Michelen guide and his MILF of a mother, with her tight sweaters and affairs, it's no wonder this boy turned out as he does.<br />The DVD is a fine transfer, with a wonderful commentary soundtrack as well.<br />I highly recommend this lovable film to viewers of all ages. It will be considered a classic for ages to come.

This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if maybe it wasn't inspired by angels instead of written by the usual Hollywood hacks.<br /><br />  There is a powerful lesson to be learned from this movie, and jerks who watch it (isn't there at least a little bit of jerk in all of us?) can actually learn two of the greatest lessons of life from this movie: 1) it's important not to be a jerk, and 2) how not to be one.<br /><br />  This movie is much more important than the casual viewer might think it is.

The performances are all excellent and the movie is gripping.  It's original and the ending is completely surprising.  It's in a similar style to "Fight Club" in that the director took another social issue--the decline of "morality" in this case--and made us think twice about both the victims and the perpetrators, and twice about right and wrong.

 | product/productId: 6300147363 | review/userId: A3LXKO2S6G2DBI | review/summary: A Flawed, if Unflinching Look at Genocide in the U.S. West | review/text: With its stark re-creation of the massacre of Native Americans at the hands of a volunteer U.S. Army during the American Civil War, it's no surprise that &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; has been largely buried by cable and broadcast TV.  When a local station was brave enough to air it--uncensored, no less--years ago, I was stunned at the depiction not only of sadistic violence, but overt racism and genocide that most westerns have chosen to whitewash or ignore to avoid offending mainstream audiences.  That said, it's not easy to watch &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; without recoiling at the visciousness of so-called civilized people who defended their actions by labelling everyone else &quot;savages.&quot;  Peter Strauss plays a wayward cavalry soldier who teams up with a frontier-savvy immigrant (Candice Bergen) on the eve of a brutal attack by the army (based loosely on Chivington's massacre of the Cheyenne at Sand Creek)  He quickly comes to realize who the real savages are but is nonetheless powerless to prevent the gleeful slaughter that includes rape and dismemberment.  &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; may remind viewers of &quot;Little Big Man&quot; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;--and there are striking similarities--but despite their higher production values, neither film seems to capture the sheer venom of actions and attitudes against Native Americans.  (The film itself stops short of depicting the full range of brutality.)  Still, &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; is far from a perfect film--the acting at times is over-the-top and the parallels to the Viet Nam War (think: My Lai Massacre) detract from the film's focus.  Watch it not as great cinema but as a glimpse of an American West we usually don't get to see.
 | product/productId: 0783231539 | review/userId: A2FXFLS60TRDC2 | review/summary: A thrill ride | review/text: I found The Thing to be a thrill ride from beginning to end.  The atmosphere was brilliantly stifling.  The special effects were quite good, even today.  Best of all, however, was the fact that The Thing sets up its scares very well, and doesn't just keep making things jump out at you and startle.  The steady crescendo of anticipation of the first half leads to a well played out paranoia thriller near the end, which will keep you guessing as to who is really human.  Even though I'd already seen many of the scary moments on youtube, the film still managed to keep me on edge.  A warning, however.  The Thing is quite gory and disgusting.  These scenes are well done, and not just there for the splatter, but they may be disturbing to those who have a low tolerance for blood.  All in all, however, The Thing is a fantastic addition to a horror fan's collection.

 | product/productId: 6300181170 | review/userId: A2J7B7F2J7V4DM | review/summary: As poor as you expected | review/text: As much as I love to fight on behalf of underdog, underrated works of art, I just can't find any good reason to redeem "Torn Curtain" from its lowly status in the pantheon.  In fact, it's likely the most unimpressive color film Hitchcock ever made.  Is it unwatchable?  Certainly not.  Paul Newman is amusingly flinty, Julie Andrews is tolerable to look at, and, very occasionally, there is some recognizable (but nowhere inspired) Hitchcock mise-en-scene to chew on.  Nonetheless, the overall mediocrity of the film can become excruciating.<br /><br />  As the most recent reviewer has ably noted, the implausibilities here are outrageous.  Would a prized defector really be allowed to walk out of the hotel the morning after his arrival and disappear who knows where?  And what the devil was the purpose of running into the museum to start with (and why was there not a soul present to protect East German cultural treasures from the grubby proletariat)?  And why did he have to go all the way out to the farm, exposing himself to such risk, for the sake of an uninstructive conversation on a tractor, which could have been had much less riskily by the American agent coming to Berlin to find Dr. Armstrong instead?  And where the heck was the old chap when they were fighting for their lives in the farmhouse?!?!?<br /><br />  And this is just the comparably better first act.<br /><br />  Indeed, even that famous farmhouse fight is, in my opinion, a somewhat lesser Hitchcock setpiece, though it suffers by the context of the film it's inclosed within.  As for the other big setpieces-- the bus ride and the ballet sequence-- there is simply nothing to be said in their defense.  The bus sequence is excruciatingly slow and laughably ridiculous, and the ballet is simply a nonstarter.  As for the coffehouse interlude with our Polish countess, I'm not quite sure whether to laugh or cry.  Perhaps it is a comment on the pathos of those trapped inside the Iron Curtain, or perhaps Hitchcock is simply amusing himself with comic relief, or relieving himself, as it were, of responsibility for this film.  At any rate, it is a more excusable exercise in mannerism than that impossible Dr. Lindt, who we might have hoped had choked on a bite of ham somewhere in the intervening years since he left Constance Petersen behind.  But why is "Torn Curtain"s East Germany about as menacing as Michael Barone's notion of Sweden anyway?  The universities are all modern, the skirts are reasonably short, and their museum, after all, is hardly "strictly for the birds".  One might almost suspect Hitchcock of subverting Cold War hysteria, except that he surely understood the totalitarian mindset all too well.  Rather, I blame a slack script and Hitch's own understandable sense of distance from this pitiful project.  After making "Psycho", "The Birds" and "Marnie", he could be excused for making something even much worse.

 | product/productId: 6302413931 | review/userId: A2U3GTI8TZV6JK | review/summary: One of the best movies ever! | review/text: Apocalypse Now is a cinematic masterpiece.  The characters in the movie are unforgettable and flawlessly portrayed by an unparalleled cast.  Yes, this is a war movie, but not a "blow 'em up" nor a "kids coming of age" war movie.  It is a movie about the various interpretations of what it means to fight a war.<br /><br />"I remember when I was with Special Forces.  Seems a thousand centuries ago.  We went into a camp to inoculate the children.  We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying.  He couldn't see.  We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm.  There they were in a pile; a pile of little arms.  And I remember... I... I... I cried.  I wept like some grandmother.  I wanted to tear my teeth out.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And I want to remember it.  I never want to forget it. I never want to forget.  And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead.  And I thought: My God... the genius of that.  The genius.  The will to do that.  Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.  And then I realized they were stronger than we."<br /><br />This movie will challenge your ideas about war, not to change them or to promote a particular ideology, but just to inspire introspection.  If you have not yet seen this movie, it should be on the top of your "Must See" list, and the DVD provides a fantastic home theater experience.

Christina stares up at her and asks, "How?" Joan responds, "You figure it out."  Words to live by.

I strongly believe one of the best scenes ever filmed was of O'Toole's character dancing with the lady celebrating her 40th anniversary.  No words had to be spoken, the look in her eyes (perhaps remembering her youth and how she had dreamed of dancing with this film star of yesteryear?), the loving gaze from O'Toole which made her feel that nobody else existed, and the orchestra playing "How High the Moon" ...<br /><br />It doesn't get much better than this.

And it started with a bang, literally, followed by some superb action right down to the middle of the film. <p>Yet, midway through the whole charade I just forgot to care about all the gory violence, not in the least due to its implausibility. Some scenes with Lithgow's terrifying cameo as the bad guy are even quite menacing and impactful. But at the end one only leaves with a taste of crassy action from cardboard characters in a staid plot. <p>An ignorable number.

The slaves were portrayed as being a bit more content and happy with their lot in life than was likely the case in reality, but everything else still feels fresh and bracing almost seventy years after the movie was produced.<br /><br />And without getting too specific for newcomers to the film, here's something interesting to think about: Did Bette Davis' character REALLY repent at the end, or is her sudden, and apparently selfless, change of heart really just a last-ditch scheme to give herself a final chance to win her beloved back?  It probably isn't, and she probably DID genuinely grow as a person, but still- as I said- it's fun to momentarily consider the other scenario.<br /><br />The Warner Brothers DVD I watched featured a crisp picture and good sound, as well as a variety of those "a night at the movies" special features, including a newsreel, cartoons, trailers, etc.  All in all, a fun package.  But it's the movie you'll remember.

How long has it been since we've seen a film focusing on believing/involved people of faith that wasn't either preachy and sanctimonious, or cynical and paranoid?  Let's see -- maybe Steve Martin's "Leap of Faith", or Denzel Washington's remake of Cary Grant's "The Preacher's Wife."  Maybe a couple more -- but not many.<br /><br />It's nice to see a film celebrate active belief without turning into "Father O'Malley and the Dirty Faced Street Urchins of New York" or "Father O'Malley and the Dirty Alter Boys of Cell Block 8."<br /><br />And yes -- it's cute, funny, & light-hearted; AND seriously about friendship, tradition, matters of faith vs. matters of religion -- and people living in this century.

 | product/productId: 0800141776 | review/userId: A1UJI61C25D89G | review/summary: An Urban Legend for Our Times | review/text: The movie begins with the suicide of a government official.  Next it shows a young woman who spends time playing computer games for profit, and dines on pizza and chocolate candy.  Her life is solitary, communicating mainly thru telephone lines.  (An earlier incident in Angela's life made her withdrawn.)  A package is delivered, and she runs the enclosed diskette.  Because of the diskette's secret, great danger enters her life.<p>The story tells how her identity can be stolen, and official records created, to make her a wanted criminal.  She survives many attempts to kill her, but her close friends do not.  All because of that diskette, whose secret is slowly revealed.<p>The secret of the diskette is how a &quot;bug&quot; was installed into protection software to create a 'trap door' that can be used to allow a person to access any computer, and then browse, create, or modify the data.  This is NOT fiction - some software does come with defaults to allow access.  (I once heard a person boast that his former firm had a tradition of doing this.)<p>Angela discovers that a deliberately incorrect medical diagnosis was created to induce the suicide of that government official. After escaping dangers, she succeeds in sending the information to the FBI, and the plot is uncovered.  (Did you note the resemblance of 'Jeff Gregg' to the fictional 'Will Styles'?)<p>The movie's style and scenes reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock: an innocent on the run due to a mistaken identity, or stumbling into a secret plot.  The parade scene recalls &quot;Blowout&quot;, the ending on the catwalk recalls &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.  Some criticize this for copying, but I would call it &quot;best practices&quot;.  But all ends well to make it a successful movie.

Drama, suspense, comedy (especially the one-liner throw aways crafted by Robert Benchley who is also in the film), character actors cast against type, Oscar-quality acting (Albert Bassermann was nominated but did not win), superb art direction, and envelop-pushing special effects.  FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (1940) received nine well-deserved Oscar nominations.  Hitchcock and wife Alma developed the script.  And what a script!  It holds up well after 70 years.  Gary Cooper turned down the lead (Joel McCrea got the part) which he later admitted had been a big mistake.<br /><br /> The real star of the picture is William Cameron Menzies, the in-camera special effects guru and the 1940 version of Industrial Light and Magic rolled into one person.  It's hard to believe that the ocean plane crash (the Clipper was shot down) sequences at the film's end were done without CGI!<br /><br /> Hitchcock at his well-rounded best.

 | product/productId: 5554461174 | review/userId: A2OCJNB6B46OKP | review/summary: A delightful family film. (Volume 1: Part 3) | review/text: In the history of animation all the way until today Disney has shined above the rest with the brining to life of classic stories. While there are other companies out there that try to succeed most of them seem to fade into the background. 'An American Tale', 'The Land Before Time' and 'The Iron Giant' are just a few.<br /><br />In 1988 in the peak of American animation Miyazaki created 'My Neighbor Totoro'. It is the story of two sisters that move into a new house that they feel is being watched by spirits. Being the adventurous girls they are, they find that there is a something there and it's big! Once they find it an incredible world of wonderous adventures begin and their lives will never be the same.<br /><br />' My Neighbor Totoro' was such a wonderful film. I was captivated by the complexity of the characters in such a simple story. It really stands up there along with some of the great Dinsey classics, which is no surprise that Disney got their hands on it. Still, in my opinion try and get your hands on the origional english dubbed film from Fox family animation. The voices are much better especially with Cheryl Chase (voice of Rugrats Angelica) as the voice of the adorable and spunky Mae. You will laugh until it hurts and just stare in amazment of all the fantastic moments that will captivate you in this adorable family film. It will probably end up on your top 10 list if you're not careful.
 | product/productId: 6300262731 | review/userId: A2D5BGCNBZVN93 | review/summary: They dont make em' like this anymore! | review/text: American Werewolf in London, is a brilliant little yarn about David  Naughton getting bit by a lycanthrope, and turning very nasty when the moon  is full. The film is done in such a way that you feel you actually know the  young Americans, and you start actually pulling for David to be cured of  the curse of the werewolf. The werewolf itself far surpasses any other in  screen history as far as scariness (Although the one in &quot;Silver  Bullet&quot; aint bad) and you will never again hear the Van Morrison hit  &quot;Moondance&quot; without thinking of Jenny Agutter. We should all be  so lucky as to have sensual hotties as nurses! &quot;Blue Moon&quot; also  is heard in many versions, and the music only adds to the atmosphere in  downtown London, all the way to the middle of the moors, and who wants to  stop at the &quot;Slaughtered Lamb&quot; for a pint of ale after the movie  is over? It is very close to being the horror hit of the eighties.`It was  to werewolves what &quot;Fright Night&quot; was to vampires. One of the  very best of the horror genre.

 | product/productId: 0792841506 | review/userId: A2Q13PHEXGR48Q | review/summary: High action war classic | review/text: The Dirty Dozen is one of those classics you can watch over and over again.  It tells the story of Major Reisman, who has to train 12 convicts for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. We see the training and then finally the Dirty Dozen's attack on their target, a French chateau full of high-ranking German officers.  The action scenes are excellent.  The movie never slows down from the beginning even with a running time of 150 minutes.  <p> The performances in the movie are great.  This huge list of Hollywood notables took part in this movie.  Lee Marvin is awesome as Major John Reisman with Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Clint Walker, and Trini Lopez as some of the Dirty Dozen.  Also starring are Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker, and George Kennedy.  This is a great movie that shouldn't be missed.  The DVD transfer is perfect.  Also included are a trailer and a behind the scenes documentary about the movie.  If you like the movie, check out the book by E.M. Nathanson.

Spend the few extra bucks to buy the millennium edition, you won't regret it.  This DVD is just another sad video tape print with lines and scratches, film bouncing all over the place, terrible edit cuts, etc....<br />While the movie may be a horror classic, there definately is no point in releasing a film on DVD unless they plan to clean up the print enough to where it appears new.  I used to watch Psycho with all the crackling and lines and such, but when I bought the DVD I was amazed at how much the print was cleaned up.  DVD's should have more thought that go into them before the final product is released.  I guess that's what I get for being cheap and buying the $7.00 way out.
 | product/productId: 6301964233 | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: English and German Versions of the Garbo Classic | review/text: Although it is overshadowed by the artistry of Eugene O'Neil's later works, ANNA CHRISTIE has remained a favorite on the world scene since its 1921 stage debut.  It has received no fewer than three major Broadway revivals and has been filmed in various languages no less than eight times, and when regional, university, and community theatres do an O'Neil drama they often select this one over O'Neil's considerably more ambitious--and difficult--works.<br /><br />The film version that is best recalled is the 1930 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production starring Greta Garbo.  MGM feared that audiences would reject Garbo for her Swedish accent, and ANNA CHRISTIE was very specifically selected for her talkie debut because the character was Swedish and would naturally have a Swedish accent.  Ironically, by the time the film was made Garbo was so fluent in English that her Swedish accent was a little too soft for the part, and she actually had to ramp it up to be convincing in the role.  Publicized with the tag line "GARBO TALKS!" the film was a great success, and Garbo would continue as a great star for another decade.<br /><br />The play was and is a gritty melodrama, and although MGM romanticized the characters and added more than a little gloss, the story remained very close to the original stage success.  Anna (Garbo) has been raised by her mother's family on a farm while her father Chris (George F. Marion, reprising his Broadway performance) worked as a sailor.  He has grown old on the New York waterfront, the captian of a coal barge who lives with a decayed but genial prostitute named Marthy (Marie Dressler.)  When he receives word that his now-adult daughter is on her way to New York, he asks Marthy to leave, lest she prove a bad influence on the girl.  When Marthy meets Anna she recognizes that Anna is a prostitute, but she says nothing, and Anna goes to live with her father on the coal barge, where exposure to wind and water gradually make her feel clean.  She eventually meets and falls in love with a sailor, Matt (Charles Bickford)--but she realizes that she cannot live the lie and in burst of anger and guilt tells both her father and Matt about her past.  It was pretty hot stuff at the time, and within a few years censorship would make it impossible to re-release the film.<br /><br />The MGM production was actually filmed in three different versions.  The best known is the English-language talkie, but many theatres were still without sound technology in 1930, and this version was also released in a silent version--a fact which may account for Garbo's excessive use of silent-movie mannerisms throughout the film.  At the same time, however, MGM released a German-language version in Europe, again starring Garbo but with a different supporting cast; the studio never considered a silent cut of this version; Garbo's performance is more subtle and the film has a harsher, less romanticized tone.  Garbo is said to have preferred the German-language version of the film, and in some ways it is indeed superior to the English version.<br /><br />The German version was not a shot-for-shot copy of the English version, but both films shared a common trait.  There is a notion that the camera was fixed in place for early talking films, and that this resulted in movies with an extremely static quality.  That is not really true, but it is true that sound was still a difficult technology in 1930, and very few directors cared to further complicate their shooting schedules with difficult camera work.  ANNA CHRISTIE is indicative of this fact, and although the camera angle changes frequently, these changes are done as straight cuts.  The camera itself does not move; there are no tracking shots, no dolly shots, no overhead boom shots, no zoom shots of any kind.  This absence of what you might call camera vocabulary does become a little wearing toward the end of the film--be it English or German.<br /><br />The DVD release offers the English version on one side of the DVD and the German version on the other.  Neither have been significantly restored, but both are in good condition and fans will find the comparison fascinating.  The German version does not include the opening scene between Chris and Marthy, and it uses several shots from the English version, with the German actors dubbing in the voices and the film darkened in order to prevent German audiences from noticing the change in actors.  Although both versions have a certain visual clunkiness, the simple power of O'Neil's story remains, and Garbo faces the dreaded microphone with considerable aplomb, while Marie Dressler walks off with her every scene in the English version.  Recommended--but it will probably be best enjoyed by fans of the playwright, the actors, or early "pre-code" talkies.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer

I am a total fan of Curtis Mayfield's music, I will admit -- his work with the Impressions in the 1960s up to his later solo releases sets a high standard.  Here is a guy with a unique style who influenced so many other artists, everyone from Bob Dylan to Bob Marley to Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah the band is a little stiff on here but they do a good job in general.  Curtis performs some of his best tunes, some very well known, others more obscure.  The music throughout is excellent and the sound and picture are top-notch on this disc.  In the interviews Curtis comes across as a very sweet and humble spirit, and being a musician myself he is an inspiration to me both personally and musically. I'm glad that there were people who had the wit to document Curtis' contributions with films like this one.

And, a silent film to boot, making it even more beautiful, because wordlessly this screenplay is flawless and completely understandable and touching sans audio.<br />Synopsis: Broken and beaten by her horrible fighter, prize fighter Battling Burrows, Lucy Burrows is the lovely, innocent, fragile creature that touches Cheng Huan's heart.<br />She stumbles into his doorstep and he carries her into his home and she awakens from her half starved, half beaten stupor to find herself surrounded by beautiful chinese silk and flowers.  Cheng tenderly washes the dirt off Lucy's face, this is a beautiful scene, well done.<br />Lucy realizes that this is the first and only person that she has encountered in her life who has made an attempt to care.  Lucy is touched and becomes the principal object in Cheng's life.  He showers her with love and kindness.<p>However, the bliss does not last long after Battling Burrows finds out about her encounters with the enamored chinaman. In a dramatic, frantic scene,  Burrows kills Lucy, and Cheng shoots Burrows dead.<br />The last scene made me cry.  The expression on Chengs face as he carries his dead love back to his home and lays her down is pitiful, and the last scene ends with Cheng plunging a knife into his heart, and a chinese boat carrying both of their souls to peace.<br />Very moving, silent performance.

 | product/productId: 555396539X | review/userId: A2QR035HCPBSLC | review/summary: One of the most groundbreaking films of all time gets one of the most groundbreaking Blu releases | review/text: Seventy two years ago, Walt Disney released his vision: an animated feature length film that would go on to create an entire industry, and become arguably the most influential film of all time. That movie? The iconic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.<br /><br />Snow White's story is timeless, and although it may be taken from fairytales, Disney's adaptation and interwoven music gave it new life, ensuring it would entertain generation after generation. It started out as "Disney's Folley," but it became something more important than even Disney himself could imagine: a timeless piece of human culture, and a testament to the power of human creativity.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to critique the actual movie itself, without taking all of that into account. It's not the most complex film; it doesn't have the greatest character development or plot. For those who haven't seen it - hopefully you're just all young and have a legit excuse - Snow White is about... Well, Snow White.<br /><br />She's a beautiful princess, living with her evil stepmother, the Queen. The Queen has a magic mirror, and asks it constantly who the fairest in the land is. The mirror, fearful of the Queen, would always say she was - but one day it answers that Snow White is fairest of all! True to her self-centered nature, the Queen orders her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods and kill her. Not wanting to harm her, the huntsman lets Snow White go, urging her to stay in the woods. It's there that she meets a group of seven dwarf miners, moves in with them, and the rest is history.<br /><br />Like I said, it's not the most complex story - or even truly original. But the way it's presented, with fantastic music and animation that remains breathtaking three quarters of a century later, it's impossible to not love the movie. It may not seem as influential today as it did back then, but there's no denying the mark Snow White has had on children throughout the world; on the animation industry; on Disney itself; and on the world.<br /><br />With the new Diamond Edition release, Disney is taking a new approach, including both Blu-ray and DVD formats in the same packaging. It may seem like a waste, but it's ingenious, really; people who buy the DVD because they have no Blu player suddenly find themselves with a Blu version, and people who buy Blu will have a DVD version to give to friends, use on trips, or watch in other rooms.<br /><br />Whether you buy the DVD or Blu-ray packaging, you're going to get the same contents: one DVD, and two Blu-ray discs, with one being the film and commentary, and the other hosting most of the features.<br /><br />With that all out of the way, let's get to what people really want to know: how the new remastering looks. In one word: brilliant. Side by side, the DVD and Blu-ray screenshots look mostly the same, with the Blu version having a much more natural and crisp color tone. But play it on a big screen, and the differences in quality become readily apparent. Whereas the DVD version loses clarity as your screen gets bigger, the Blu-ray version remains crystal clear.<br /><br />It really looks as if you're watching the actual animation cels themselves move, it's so clear looking. I've been amazed by plenty of older films' transfers before, but this is up there with Wizard of Oz in terms of wowing me with what a studio can do with movies from the early 20th century given a little time to revisit them.<br /><br />The new 7.1 audio track also sounds great. For most of the movie it isn't really too obvious, but at a few key times - mainly during the memorable songs - you can really hear the work that went into this version. And, for you old-school folk out there, the mono version is also included if you want to hear the original soundtrack to the film.<br /><br />In terms of extras, a few things are missing from the 2001 edition, but ultimately this is a release that will keep fans busy watching for a long time. There's hours of supplemental features in this release, and amazingly a vast majority of them are at least worth one watch. (Some, like Disney's required "a modern Disney 'star' sings a 'hit' song addition you can skip.)<br /><br />There are backstage looks at how the film was made, commentary from multiple people and historians, The Backstage Disney portion and the details given about Walt and the creation of Snow White is something that all fans of Disney, movies, and history should really enjoy. The little factoids about how jokes came about, and about how Walt dug through trash to find scenes they threw away are really fun to find out.<br /><br />Really, I can't recommend this release enough. Not only is it a fantastic video transfer of a film that's 72 years old (which you'll forget when you see it), but it's a piece of American history. Snow White has never looked, sounded, or been presented better. With both DVD and Blu-ray included, there's no reason not to get this set. And, if you don't have a Blu-ray player, Disney is once again providing more than enough reason to look at upgrading to the high-def format.

 | product/productId: 5553694329 | review/userId: A1L43KWWR05PCS | review/summary: TERRIFIC ALIEN INVASION FILM... | review/text: This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.

If this film does not quite make sense, it is most likely because about 45 minutes or more had been "trimmed" from the original film.  In spite of this hatchet job, this is still an good film.  Yes, I bought one and I liked it but I wish they would release the restored version of this film.  According to The Night of Dark Shadows Restoration Site, they have already found about 35 minutes of missing footage.  The rest appears to be lost forever.  There are a lot of really good horror movies that are still not available on video, yet there is so much poorly done stuff and stupid slasher stuff that is out there.  Truly a shame.

Great acting by River Phoenix and Lili Taylor.<br /><br />It`s a film about a few marines who are organizing a dogfight party (the guy who gets the ugliest girl to the party wins the pot) the night before they are being shipped to Vietnam.<br /><br />You just can`t help feeling sorry for the Rose girl(Lily Taylor)<br /><br />and the story does something to you.<br /><br />I liked the periode that the movie is playing (60`s), it looks very believable that it is that time. In some movies you don`t really believe that it`s that periode. I would have liked to see a little more from the Vietnam scene of the story though, now you only see 2 minutes of it.<br /><br />I`m usually not so keen on romantic movies, but this one is my favorite in this gender.<br /><br />So i accidently came upon this movie, and i ordered it right away. It was worth every dollar.<br /><br />Here in the Netherlands it hasn`t come on DVD yet.<br /><br />But the english subtitles helped.<br /><br />So i recommend this movie to everybody.
 | product/productId: 0767827791 | review/userId: A6FIAB28IS79 | review/summary: A Vibrant, Stirring American Classic. | review/text: Unlike Bogdanovich's &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; which pretends to be a naturalistic, candid account of the death of small-town rural America in the fifties, but is really sensationlaistic and contrived, Josh Logan's  adpatation of William Inge's &quot;Picnic&quot; places us squarely into  that idyllic world before subtly suggesting the pressures that will soon  bring about its collapse.  Each of the characters is driven by deep and  desperate desires to break free into a life of opportunity and  fulfilliment, a world which upon retrospect may seem more limited than the  community it was soon to replace.  &quot;Picnic&quot; also contains the  most erotically-charged scene in all of film.  When Kim Novak  sensuously  swivel-hips down the steps leading to William Holden, accompanied by the  &quot;source-music&quot; chords of &quot;Moonglow,&quot; we become  expectant of some orgasmic culmination.  It's provided by the film's  score--the superimposed &quot;Picnic&quot; theme--and by the graceful  circular movement of Logan's camera.  The two lovers bearly touch, and  Holden couldn't dance.  Yet the actors'  electrical &quot;presence&quot;  and Logan's construction of the scene are all that's required to engage us  fully in the moment.  The latter 3rd of the film, until the final scene, is  more melodramatic and is not up to the first two-thirds, which must  certainly represent the very best of Hollywood in the 1950s.
 | product/productId: 6301963660 | review/userId: A3JI6QN6EVXQKW | review/summary: BETTER THAN IT HAS A RIGHT TO BE | review/text: **MY ACTUAL RATING WOULD BE 3.5 STARS**<br /><br />I believe reviewer Mr Robert Wilson and others have several things wrong and are perhaps being a bit nit-picky: This movie was made with the FULL co-operation and consent of Dr Arthur C. Clarke and the blessing of Stanley Kubrick!! You've got to wonder sometimes if people even see the same movie you do!<br /><br />First of all, LET ME GET SOMETHING CLEAR AND STRAIGHT: Almost NOBODY is as big a fan of Kubricks' original 2001: A Space Odyssey as I am. Yet I admire Peter Hyam's version of the Arthur C. Clarke sequel novel. Visually, it has many cues that link it to the Kubrick original and the special effects even today in the 21st Century still work very well.<br /><br />Hyams wisely chose NOT to emulate the style of Kubrick, which would have been a lost cause on several levels, anyway.<br />A: It wouldn't have been as good if he did.<br />B: He would have been harshly criticised for trying.<br />C: The general audiences of 1984 and beyond wouldn't go see such a esoteric, 'antiquated' style of movie direction anymore (More fool them, I say!).<br /><br />The acting performances are uniformally good, particularly Roy Scheider and Bob Balaban. Balaban does intellectual roles better than almost anyone, though I was irritated that the character's ethnicity had been changed from Sri-Lankan/Indian. But 2010 is not without it's problems now, which are mostly retroactive: the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore, along with the Cold War. Also, space technology in the real 21st Century is, unfortunately, nowhere near as advanced as that portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Conclusion? 2010 succeeds, but only if you think that sequels are a good idea at all. After all, this is NOT "Highlander 2" or "Jaws 4" you know!! I'd like to see this film fully remastered in Anamorphic, Hi-Def with DTS sound and a host of interviews and making-of features.

I guess that is neither here nor there, but I would have loved to see what Stone's theory on those episodes were.<br /><br />Now, as far as the BD itself is concerned, the picture is true HD, although it does not look spectacular in the beginning due to artistic purposes, but as the color comes in, the quality also does as well.  The sound IS HD and you can hear the clear different switching from Dolby to Dolby TrueHD.<br /><br />I am not too crazy about these book cases, but since this film is now almost 20 years old (hard to believe!), the book help to recall some things that were forgotten when this was coming out.<br /><br />I noticed in the film that the Paines and Johnny Carson were left out of the film.  I assume it has to do with legal matters.  While Costner's performance won rave reviews, it would have been nicer if he tried to mimic Garrion's voice, which seems easy enough to do.<br /><br />This of course is a must have film, especially if you are into history and while we wait for the government to develop a good excuse for what really happened when they let us know.  It is almost a half a century now, so the US might as well come clean.  We'll see it Obama does Ted a favor...

 | product/productId: 6301773578 | review/userId: A2BIRXDCG4I420 | review/summary: Finally! The original version! This is the real deal! | review/text: First of all, pay no attention to the *morons*...yes, let me repeat myself *morons* who wrote reviews of this dvd back in July, 2 months BEFORE this dvd version was even released. This is the real version of "Return Of The Jedi". If you are here, I won't watse time about plot spoilers. If you have a pulse, then most likely you know what this movie is about. There were several key scenes that I had to make sure were untouched by Lucas's eveil CGI crazed hands.<br /><br />First off, in Jabba's Palace, no extra cgi dancers with Max Rebo's Band...all original stuff.<br /><br />Second, no new tentacles or venus flytrap looking mouths with the Sarlaac Pit!<br /><br />Next, when Anakin has his mask removed by Luke, Sebastian Shaw who portrays Anakin has his eyebrows back! Yah!<br /><br />The Ewok celebration scene...this was the one scene that disturbed me most by George's evilness. On this version we finally have the original Ewok celebration music! Finally!<br /><br />And finally, the one scene that disturbed EVERYONE is the SW Universe...the Jedi Spirits. The late great Sebastian Shaw is finally once again shown as Anakin as a Jedi Spirit! This was a change that George really should have been kicked in the head about back in '04 when de digitally erased Shaw & replaced him with a new shot of Hayden Christiansen. Anakin returned to good, a Jedi when Luke brought back the good in him, hence Shaw as the spirit. Luke had never even seen what the young Anakin looked like, so why would/could Luke even recognize a young Anakin, yet alone smile at him!?<br /><br />Thank you George, this is what I've been waiting for for years...the original version of "Jedi", my personal fav in the SW series. It only took petitions & angry posts by diehard SW fans.<br /><br />Just remember, the story is what makes a movie, not the fancy SFX.
 | product/productId: 0767837398 | review/userId: A16TOENL3NDHDY | review/summary: "SLC Punk" is just plain stupid. | review/text: If I could best describe this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, "SLC Punk," is just plain stupid. This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at "The Sundance Film Festival" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the "F-word" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that "less is more." There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to "go-against-the-grain." It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing. There's not a whole lot I can say about SLC Punk, other than I think it's a complete waste of time and money. This movie is rated [R] for: Profanity, Vulgarity, Drug Use, Teen Partying, and Violence. All things condsidered, I wouldn't recommend seeing it.

I am still impressed by the special effects, and a good creepy story. Today's digital effects may dazzle, but they're no scarier than anything that was presented in The Thing 20 years ago. The models, puppetry and makeup still work.<p>If you're looking for gratuitous pin-up shots, you won't find them (or a female for that matter) in this film. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you guessing beyond the final credits, this may be the film for you. If you are looking for the kind of Boogey-man frights that you experienced at horror movies as a kid, then this is definitely the film for you.

 | product/productId: 0790731010 | review/userId: A356LWRQEBIYHU | review/summary: Be Warned: This DVD is NOT a true wide-screen! | review/text: My God. They created this wide-screen version of  "Chariots of Fire, Two Disk Special Edition" by chopping off the top and bottom (or just the bottom) of the old full-screen version of the same title. In other words, the old full-screen version has more screen to watch.<br /><br />I don't think they even bothered to remaster this from the original tape, because the old full screen version is actually sharper on my monitor screen than this wide screen version if I watch them side by side. So, I'm giving one star for this their shady business, even though I believe that the film itself is one of the best films ever made. Let's hope that they will do it right for Blu-ray version, assuming that someone will publish a Blue-ray version.
 | product/productId: 0767827902 | review/userId: A1HG2DOSBZEX4I | review/summary: Classic American Cinema | review/text: Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show is a movie about the changing face of America as seen through the eyes of a small town. The film relates the happenings in Anarene,Texas from October 1951 to October 1952. America is changing. The cinema on the corner than had been the hub of life for the small town is giving way to the television age. Into this world comes the senior class of Anarene High School.<br /><br />School friends Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) yearn for more than the town has to offer. They also yearn for the prettiest girl in town Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepard). As their lives change we learn of the goings on of the citizens around them: there is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson)owner of the cinema, the cafe and the pool hall; Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) the wife of the high school coach who wants more in her life; Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) caught in a world in which she is alone with herself.<br /><br />The film is episodic but makes its points with ease. The ensemble cast was justly praised and the film was awarded with eight Academy Award nominations. Director Bogdanovich never had a better film than this and the black and white photography by Robert Surtees is almost perfect.<br /><br />The disc is the definitive director's cut which adds about eight minutes of previously deleted footage. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1 as was the presentation print. The mono sound while not perfect does an adequate job with the dialogue filled script. The extras are the hour long documentary The Last Picture Show: A Look Back which features interviews with Bogdanovich and the cast; a short theatrical Re-release featurette and some talent files.<br /><br />This film deserves to be on the shelf of any serious movie lover.

One day, I started singing, "Forward! Forward! Moving fast forward!" I was thinking, what song is this and why I am randomly remembering it!? THEN I FIGURED IT OUT! I immediately played the film on Amazon, and you'd be surprised to know just how much of the plot I still remember.<br /><br />Fast Forward is a great story of determination and dreams.

With the cartoons, jokes and classic songs, this is a film that kids to great grandparents can watch and enjoy equally.<p>There is so many great and important lessons too in the film. One such lesson is in the song "feed the birds" which teaches the importance of caring for all living things. Personally I get a warm and "in touch with Earth" feeling when I feed a deer, duck, etc, etc... Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep. As he and the children look out through the rooftop view of the city, burt tells the children how only the birds, planes and chimney sweeps get to see this view everyday. Its an important lesson to see the bright side of things even in the worst of situations. That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers. <p>Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry. You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.<br />  The DVD quality is amazing. Im a bit dissapointed that there is no extra cartoons with this one, but the movie is more then enough fun.

After just a few weeks you can really feel the difference in your speed and endurance from following this program. (Just make sure you eat right and get enough rest because it's a good challenge).  There are so many technical drills and moves as well that I'm sure even an experienced soccer player will find something new. The nutrition and motivation tips were a nice touch also, but I liked the workout the best.  If you play soccer seriously it's worth checking out.

 | product/productId: 6300147630 | review/userId: A3N6GAJTEOF4MO | review/summary: I Honestly Expected More | review/text: In my own personal experience, Scanners was one of those movies that everybody around you had seen and told you how great it was but you still hadn't gotten around to it. I did finally get around to watching the film and I have to be honest, I expected a lot more from my experience. It was good don't get me wrong, but personally from my enjoyment of classic cheesy 80s horror-esque type movies, this didn't fit the bill. The acting was wooden and the story quite boring, sure it's a film about people who can read minds, but when you have your main character, a man who didn't originally know he was a Scanner all of a sudden become the most powerful Scanner, I felt the whole thing was rushed.<br /><br />The tag line for this movie was "There are 4 billion people on earth. 237 are Scanners. They have the most terrifying powers ever created... and they are winning." Sounds like a good premise for a movie no? It's a great idea that could have made a great movie and although Scanners had its moments I just found the whole thing boring. The main character Cameron Vale played by Stephen Lack wasn't as interesting as I think Cronenberg expected him to be. He had the creepy look about him and he could pull the serious Scanner face as if he was constipated and trying to push one out, but that was about the only thing he had going for him.<br /><br />The bloody bits were quite cool and very graphic as they were in those days. The infamous head exploding scene in particular grabbed my attention and disturbed me a little. Michael Ironside who plays the apparently very evil underground Scanner lord Darryl Revok is one of the best parts of the film and comes across as quite intimidating at times.<br /><br />The story of the film is relatively simple, as the tag line implies there are 237 Scanners in the world and they're winning. Winning what exactly? well that's the war against normal humanity I think, let's be honest if they can read minds and we can't that makes them the enemy. Well a weaponry company known as ConSec and they manage to recruit and 'convert' a very powerful Scanner known as Cameron Vale. Dr. Paul Ruth head of ConSec's Scanner section trains Vale and sends him to find and stop Revok, with some surprising results.<br /><br />OK, the movie is a bit more complicated than that but my point still stands about it not being as good and as special as people would have you believe. It's not the worst film I've ever seen and there are genuinely entertaining parts, however, there were points in which I found the film quite tedius and a bit predictable. I would recommend this as it's a worthy waste of your time, but I would say to not expect much.
 | product/productId: 0792139895 | review/userId: A3HFMIS88YRWC | review/summary: This is the most disappointing Blu-Ray movie I have ever purchased. | review/text: This is the most disappointing Blu-Ray movie I have ever purchased. It is not the picture quality or the story line - both of which are fantastic... it is the poor sound quality - which is why you buy a blu-ray movie in the first place and one expects top rate sound quality.<br /><br />We have considered returning this movie to Amazon - the first one I have ever been prompted to do - as we feel it is a disc that has somehow slipped through the system and is defective in the quality one expects and rightly anticipates with the blu-ray technology.<br /><br />We used to own this movie on Laser Disc where the sound quality was first class.  But on the blue-ray, with the volume turned right up on a sytsem that only uses three tenths volume as a rule of thumb, one could still barely hear the conversation which was faint and hardly crisp or distinct at all.<br /><br />Were it not for the cost of returning the product to the USA, it would have been in the mail weeks ago.  It was not an expensive disc to buy in the first place, and so we feel that Amazon knew it had purchased 'a lemon' and was selling it off cheap.<br /><br />So on sound quality, I rate it less than one star. The rest is top class ---- but it is the sound effects that 'make' or break a movie - so that is very important aspect of the enjoyment one expects when one has first rate equipment to play first rate DVD technology on.<br /><br />We already had a previously purchased "The Hunt for The Red October" on standard DVD, so after half an hour of hoping the blu-ray edition would 'pick up in quality', we took it off and put on the standard DVD version...and here the sound quality was perfect by comparison... though the picture quality was not as good as the blu-ray version. From this we determined that the blu-ray disc was faulty and made moves to apply for a return to Amazon for a refund; the follow through of which we have not yet actioned.

 | product/productId: 6300262731 | review/userId: A1N7YA81ZI4KAF | review/summary: A First-Rate Horror/Comedy.  A Great Viewing Experience. | review/text: Two American's are attacked by a massive beast one dark, foggy night while back-packing in the English moors. One is killed, the other is sent to the hospital. David, the survivor, is then plagued by disturbing, violent nightmares brought on by his near death experience. Soon his dead friend begins re-appearing (in various stages of decomposition) informing David that they were attacked by a werewolf and if he doesn't kill himself soon, he will become one himself and will be responsible for many deaths. David does not believe his dead chum and dismisses his claims as rubbish. That is of course until that night when things start to get a little hairy.<br /><br />Next to "The Howling", this werewolf spectacle is one of my favourite all time horror movies. It's an odd mixture of horror and humour. So even if you hate "fright" films, you may find something to like here. The film's cast is first rate. It doesn't have any world famous superstars but the actors give good performances throughout. Jenny Agutter, the werewolf's love interest, is lovely to look at while Griffen Dunne is hysterical as the walking dead friend given the difficult task of tormenting his buddy. The lead actor, David Naughton is also excellent. His portrayal of the tormented David is touching. But despite the film's impressive cast, the real reason to see this film is for its ingenious makeup effects. No CGI monsters here folks, instead the viewer is rewarded with several creative scenes of grotesque imagery. The transformation scene is especially spellbinding. It qualifies as the greatest werewolf transformation scene ever screened. The beast is not clearly shown until the final frames of the film so during those earlier attack scenes, the camera acts as the beast's eyes and the overall effect is chilling (The subway scene never fails to send chills up my spine). This picture's major highlight is its spectacular climax. Once the beast is unleashed upon the people of London, all hell breaks loose. There are car crashes, bus crashes, people being run over by cars. It's wonderfully chaotic and violent.<br /><br />I don't know which film I like better, this one or "The Howling". They're both outstanding horror films but despite the werewolf theme, they are different. "The Howling" takes place in a rural setting while "Werewolf In London" takes place in an urban one. In my opinion, "The Howling" is darker, more frightening, "Werewolf In London" is funnier but gorier. The transformation scenes also differ. Dante's film is less spectacular but nastier, more bone-chilling and the werewolves look more like wolves and stand upright. The beast in "London" walks on all fours resembling a massive, mutated dog. I urge the viewer to watch both films and decide for themselves which they like better.<br /><br />"An American Werewolf In London" is a classic and it's highly recommended. It's tongue-and-cheek horror done splendidly with one of the fiercest werewolves ever captured on film. Enjoy!<br /><br />4.5 out of 5.

I love piano, I come from a very musical family, and piano was always my favorite. I also love "boogie woogie" music. This show was very exciting and fun to watch. Jerry Lee plays even more of the High School song to give Brian May the chance to play his guitar after he has an "instrument malfunction". He is very kind to the fan who got on the stage. And he seemed to be in some pain in his back. It was pretty easy to see that he was wearing a back brace. His musical talent is prodigious, and he should be the King of Rock, not Elvis. He was trying to keep all the guitarists in control, kind of like a band leader would do, and he does it. It did seem like it took him some time (5 songs) to really warm up. But that is just the way he seems to be.

It's like Wack-A-Mole at Chucky Cheese.  So many moles, so few mallets.  This movie is singularly the most cruel movie I've seen in the past dozen years.  It's Animal Farm with a bad Hawaiian soundtrack and no sense of humor. It's so bad, I have to talk in broken sentences, like a punch-drunk boxer who lost the last round on a technicality.  Wait - I am getting a sense of how the story-board at Disney went!! Happy-go-lucky, destructive beastie does not fit in to society.  Moons government authority figure.  Audience giggles, nods in understanding that he must be banished.  Can't be productive member of higher society.  Only an evil scientist likes it. Stitch is only redeemed when he learns to appreciate family, and get along with everybody else. Children taught valuable lesson about what happens when authority figures go unheeded. Estrangement, banishment, righteous indignation - Bad musical interludes will be your fate if you do not find your right place in Society. See, everybody really wants to "be like folks", right? We all wanna be the SAME, don't we?  We wanna FIT IN and FIND OUR PLACE in the world. Oh sure, Stitch can be crazy and wacky and creatively independant (for the first half of his life), but when it gets right down to it, he's a sorry, needy squid like the rest of the modern world.  Stitch is on his knees begging for Family before the One-Hour mark in the movie, spittling the movie's theme line just in CASE you missed the point when it was said for the previous 87 times.  Ohana means Family.  Of course, it's not really about family - it's about conformity (maybe that's what family is about these days, too - who knows?).  It's about finding a group and blending in.  Disney tells us about freedom - the freedom to be like everyone else or be excoriated.  Excuse me, but I'd rather cozy up to "Dude Where's My Car" while being pelted with rocks than ever have to subject myself to this trite, insidious piece of propaganda again.  If I wanted trashy propaganda, I'd watch Triumph of the Will - at least then the fascists would be easily spotted.  Today, they apparently sometimes have mouse ears and cute fuzzy voices.
 | product/productId: 6302289009 | review/userId: A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4 | review/summary: History repeating itself | review/text: This story takes place in the present day and is about an unnamed woman (Emma Thompson) who keeps having reoccurring nightmares about a man named Roman Strauss who, in the 1940's, was convicted and sentenced to death for killing his wife Margaret Strauss.  What's interesting is that Margaret in these dreams also looks identical to the unnamed woman of present day.<br />We're also told that something traumatic happened to this unnamed woman that has caused her to lose both her memory and her voice.<br /><br />One day, a L.A. private eye named Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh), who also happens to look identical to Roman Strauss in the dreams, is instructed to transport this unnamed woman (whom he's called "Grace") to a mental hospital.  However, once they get there, he has a change of heart and instead, has Grace stay at his place.<br />To help get her memory back, Mike also has Grace see a hypnotist (Derek Jacobi) who might be able to uncover some of her traumatic memories.<br /><br />What's interesting is that, as we're told more and more about her dreams, the events from the 1940's start to happen in present day, too.  And so, there's building suspense if Mike will end up killing Grace just like Roman ended up killing his wife Margaret in the 1940's.  But the story gets even more complicated as more suspects start entering the picture, too.  There then becomes a possibility that maybe Roman was wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit....so then where does that leave Grace's fate?<br /><br />This is a very entertaining and compelling movie to watch.  The acting is pretty good, too, except in some cases, Branagh looks a little awkward in this role.  There is, however, good chemistry between Branagh and Thompson (it helps they were a real life married couple during this time).<br />I liked that her dreams are presented in black and white as a way to help you get a feel for that era...and to also help distinguish the two stories apart.<br /><br />However, there was something odd I noticed, too.  For example, when Grace first meets Mike, she isn't surprised that he looks identical to the murdering husband in her dreams, which is odd.  Also, when they're visiting the hypnotist and the hypnotist shows Mike and Grace a photo of Roman and Margaret Strauss, neither look surprised that the couple look identical to them.<br />There's also a problem with the first dream Grace has involving Roman and the detective (Andy Garcia). Given how the movie ends, this first scene doesn't make sense.<br /> Another  problem I had was the fight scene towards the end looked kind of silly.<br />But other than that, I found this movie suspenseful and entertaining.
 | product/productId: 6302055008 | review/userId: A2ZSC81MXLBELX | review/summary: Good Stuff..... | review/text: This review refers to the WB DVD edition of "Goodfellas".....<br /><br />Based on the book "Wiseguy"(a true story) by Nicholas Pileggi, "Goodfellas" follows the lives of New York mobsters for over 2 decades of crime, loyalties, and settled scores. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Robert Deniro and Lorraine Bracco, it is an electrifying and innovative piece of filmaking.<br /><br />Scorsese gives us a remarkable and often graphic look at the lives of theses "Goodfellas" and their families. From the time they were young men working on the streets for the mob bosses in the late fifties, through more than 20 years of heists, murder, corruption, prison time and drug deals, it is a story that is truly captivating.<br /><br />Everything about this film is amazing.The film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. The performances by the actors are as powerful as any I have ever seen. Joe Pesci recieved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and well deserved for his portrayal of the explosive Tommy DeVito. A terrific Screenplay and wonderful Film Editing also got nods from Oscar, and the Soundtrack gives the feel of the time periods throughout.  It takes in everything from Tony Bennett to Sid Vicious and also the wonderful "Layla" by Derek and the Dominoes. Also adding their fabulous talents are Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Illeana Douglas and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />I thought the DVD was good transfer. The picture, presented in Widescreen was clear and sharp and the colors were very good. The sound in 5.1 Dolby Surround was not the best I ever heard, but it seemed to filter through nicely and the music and dialouge sounded good. There was the minor annoyance with having to turn the disc over and I also had a pausing problem with the first 2 minutes of Side B(This may just be my copy, as I have not seen any other complaints on that). Neither of these things effected my viewing pleasure enough to take a whole star off this remarkable film.No Special Features to speak of. There are some production notes, theatrical trailers and it may be viewed in French. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish for those who may need them.<br /><br />This is a film that may not be for everybody. There is quite a bit of graphic violence and language, but at only 13 years old it is surely already  a classic.<br /><br />So Warner Bros....how about a special edition, one that we don't have to turn over???(and some commentary from Mr. Scorsese would be nice on this one too!).....Thanks and enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Joe Pesci:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303219357">Jimmy Hollywood</a>

They automatically associate him with the original Predator, so they do not approach the film with an open mind.<p>Assuming you aren't one of those...<p>Danny Glover is a nice change as he relies on his gray matter to defeat this second predator, which makes the film seem down-to-earth.  This film is far more thought-provoking than the first, but that is because the first film is more action-based, while the second film is more character-based.  A great &quot;...what if ordinary people had to deal with this extra-terrestrial hunter...&quot; type of film.  The musical score is improved over the first though.  A worthy successor to the first film.<p>The DVD itself though is only an average production quality.

 | product/productId: 0790737310 | review/userId: A2198FZZMTJ38H | review/summary: The best supernatural romance since &quot;Ghost.&quot; | review/text: There is an offbeat sense of style and passion which sets &quot;City of Angels&quot; apart from most other romantic films, a sense that comes from the movie's refusal to cast flashy, young stars amidst a cliched plotline. Instead, the film enhances a highly original story through two very enticing leads, Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, who have a pulsating chemistry that is intrical to the overall effect of the film. Director Brad Silberling's visual style and an enigmatic soundtrack all converge to create one of the best romances of all time. <p>The story begins by introducing us to Seth, an angel who brings freshly dead souls to Heaven (&quot;I always asked them what they liked best about life&quot;). He is not alone on Earth: there are many other angels on the planet, circulating throughout the city of Los Angeles in black trenchcoats, making their way to the beach to watch the sunset... heck, their local hangout is the public library. We are witness to many different situations, deaths and one convenience store robbery, where the angels interact in order to instill their sense of calm over people. <p>Seth is a very complex character, his charming and calm attitude and his handsome looks making him an ideal angel. On his arrival to take a dead hospital patient to Heaven, he meets eyes with Maggie, or thinks he does (she can't see him), and he is immediately drawn to her beauty. He later learns that if he wants her to see him, then she will in her own time, which, fortunately for him, is sooner rather than later. Maggie does not believe in angels or God, so the many strange occurances that surround her meeting and her getting to know Seth will test her faith in her beliefs. <p>Of course, this big question is whether or not they will end up together in the end. This is something that the movie toys with immensely as it examines the relationship between Seth and Maggie, which is more fragile than you would think. Maggie's insecurities about her newfound love and Seth's naivety of the ways of human life provide some heartwarming and sometimes tear-jerking moments which further enhance the bond between them. And once Maggie finds out about his origins, the relationship takes an entirely different avenue, which I'll leave you to discover on your own. <p>There is a nice amount of chemistry between the two lead acting talents. Nicolas Cage is the perfect choice for Seth: his angelic looks and his sensitive demeanor evoke feelings of serenity and calmness while the audience is graced by his onscreen presence. His character is very complex when it comes to making new discoveries about life, and Cage brings out all of the confusion quite convincingly. Meg Ryan is outstanding, as always, in her role of Maggie, who is required to experience big shows of emotion. Ryan does this superbly, and one scene that comes to mind takes place in an empty hospital stairwell, where Maggie cries for her patient. This scene gives the actors a chance to show what they are really made of, while subtly bringing to life to budding chemistry between the two that will culminate later on. <p>Two supporting roles of this film also add to the movie's story. Dennis Franz plays a fallen angel who chose to leave his heavenly status for a woman he fell in love with, and once he meets Seth, he begins explaining his experiences to his new friend in order to help him get a grip on his feelings. Andre Braugher plays Seth's confidant angel, who helps him keep his head on his shoulders. Both of these characters offer interesting insight and element into the secret life of angels, which makes us think of what really does exist out there. <p>The overall sense of style and grace that the movie charms us with seems a bit more sophisticated than most romantic films. The images are easy on the eyes: we are given everything at a steady pace, which allows us to pay more attention to the love story. Silberling's brilliant shots tell the story in such intricate and enlightening ways. Tight shots of the actors bring us more into the emotion of the film, while beautiful beach shots of the sunrise as underwater filming are breathtaking. Seth's &quot;fall&quot; will certainly be talked about for its wonderful composition: there is such a momentus amount of intensity and awe in that moment, which makes it one of the film's defining turning points. <p>The soundtrack is also a major key element to the success of this film. Most of the music centers around the theme of loneliness, wanting someone back, and (what else?) angels. The most evocative song of the film is Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Angel,&quot; which rings outs its haunting melodies and meaningful lyrics to a scene that practically melts my heart. The score for the film, done by Gabriel Yared, combines new age influences with modern beats that keep it interesting and emotional. The score certainly fits the film, as do the many songs. <p>I deeply enjoyed &quot;City of Angels.&quot; This is a movie that I can sit through and not have to worry about bashing: it has all the classical elements of a romance with a new twist, which is carried out meticulously by superb acting and a tremendous directorial effort. This is the best supernatural romance since &quot;Ghost.&quot;

Baker looks nothing like Harlow. In fact she was in her mid 30's when she made this film. The real Harlow died at 26. It is chock full of fictional characters. The only redemption it holds is Angela Lansbury, a great actress who can give class to even the worst drivel and this film takes the grand prize! I saw the other version of Harlow starring Carol Lynley and even though it was cheaply made and highly fictionalized it is better than Baker's version.

When I saw it was on Blu-ray I thot it might be a nice present for her. I am still new to the whole Blu-ray thing but I was expecting much better picture quality. Some of the close up scenes were so grainy it looked like they had "pox" marks, we were very dissapointed. It was like they had copied an old, worn, VHS tape to Blu-ray. The 3 stars are because we still love the movie, just very sad about the picture quality.
 | product/productId: 0790732521 | review/userId: A3LU79BYMWZEW9 | review/summary: A much better film than I had imagined... | review/text: What a shame that whenever this film is mentioned nowadays, it's almost always referred to as a Julia Roberts flop.  It's actually scarcely a Julia Roberts film at all. Her role is quite minor-and it's commendable that she  took it on, really, since she was already a star. I gather she was looking  for serious roles in meaty films in an effort to beef up her acting  credentials.  <p>And this certainly was a meaty film.  It is, in fact, a  much, much better film than I had ever imagined from the reviews of the  time.  I only regret never having seen it on the big screen, because its  epic sweep and beautiful cinematography would have been all the more  impressive.<p>Americans, including Irish-Americans like myself, have only  the vaguest notions of Irish history.  We learn the basics in school, and  probably, most educated Americans have an idea of approximately when and  how the Irish Republic was established.  We may also know that six counties  in the North remained under British rule and are still part of the UK (at  least, I hope we do--after 30 years of reports on the  &quot;troubles&quot;).  <p>&quot;Michael Collins&quot; goes some distance  toward filling in those informational gaps.  I am aware that many critics  have challenged writer/director Neil Jordan's interpretation of Irish  history (in particular his making Eamon De Valera, the President of the  Irish Republic, something of a villain).  To that, one can only respond  that historical dramas are by definition an interpretation of history.  I  see that a few of the reviewers below have mentioned that this film  inspired them to seek out more information about Irish history.  Those of  us that do will eventually get a more balanced view, perhaps. It was not  Neil Jordan's job to provide us with that perspective.  His job as an  artist was to tell as engaging a story as he could. On that score, he has  succeeded very well indeed.

 | product/productId: 6301272250 | review/userId: A2CT2SA6KFE8GC | review/summary: Death and Mayhem-As Advertised | review/text: Intruder is a slasher film directed by Scott Spiegel, who as horror fans know, is a buddy and writing partner of Sam Raimi.<br />The slasher carnage takes place after hours in a grocery store as the night crew work.  Early on in the film, the crazy ex-boyfriend of our heroine shows up and causes a big scene.  He's kicked out of the store but continues to lurk about and make phone calls.  Soon, folks start getting bumped off.  All suspicions are on Craig, the crazy ex boyfriend, but we all pretty much know he's not the killer because such great lengths are taken to make it look like he is.<br />The killings don't begin until quite a while into the film.  Usually in slasher films the killings are sprinkled throughout the film, but here they all happen in about a ten minute chunk.  Be that as it may, I really didn't find the movie to be boring or to drag, even though for stretches it didn't seem like alot was going on.<br />Some of the kills are rather impressive, and as you can imagine, this whole film is done rather tongue in cheek rather than in an effort to scare the pants off you.  Spiegel obviously learned all he knows from Raimi as he pretty much directs in the same style-Not totally, but awfully close.  Lots of zany camerawork and goofy POV shots all around.<br />As you may already know, Raimi himself plays a small role as the store butcher, and Bruce Campbell shows up for less than a minute of actual screen time as a police officer.  Slapping Campbell's name boldly on the DVD box cover is kind of a low blow considering we're only talking about a cameo here.<br />I liked looking at the groceries on the shelves and seeing how much product logos have changed, especially cereal boxes!  And cigarettes costing a BUCK FIFTY!!  My my my, and people think things are so much better today.

However, if you are ruled by simplistic, emotional responses--logic be damned--then you might LOVE this mess.  Even if your legal knowledge just comes from Matlock you will reject this preposturous drama.  There are so many ludicrous events that I can't list them all here, but I love how the defense attorney goes on a drinking binge the night before closing, and then presents his sole defense argument to the jury: close your eyes and imagine the girl was white!  What are we, in the 2nd grade?  Of course, such &quot;logic&quot; is compelling in Hollywood, and for many others as well, I guess.<p>If you want a terrific courtroom drama, check out The Verdict, with a lawyer that actually busts his behind to get evidence.

 | product/productId: 1556586892 | review/userId: A27TUIV7QIOQ3I | review/summary: A Must for any Warhol Fan. | review/text: This video although along the same lines as the Portrait series on Warhol seems to take a more personal approach to this very unique man.  I was pleased with the family interviews and looks into his life as a young man, it helps to reason why Warhol although very sociable was actually a shy and mysterious person.  The film takes info on the person and gradually moves into his art, there are quite a few clips of Warhol being interviewed about his work which do nothing for the novice because he does not say much of anything but they do add to the mystique of the artist.  I was pleased with the input of some of his "Posse", they seem to give a candid representation of their relationships with Warhol and along with video footage of the artist in action and in routine living help to put this video as a top documentary into the life of an artist.  Warhol as many artists of the period seems to poke fun at himself and not take what he does very seriously although we know what he did was seriously important in history.  I think regardless whether you like his art or not, he has to be one of the most influential & innovative artists ever.

 | product/productId: 0800179501 | review/userId: A3EFCK0HZQPNQI | review/summary: A minor classic! | review/text: It's a little surprising to realize that "The Karate Kid" is now 24 years old.  Made in 1984, it still holds its own in 2008.  In fact, it's a LOT better than many of the movies being churned out today.<br /><br />Why?  For me, it's simply the excellent acting.  Somehow, the chemistry between "Daniel-san" and "Mister Miyagi" is excellent, and memorable.  Without this, the movie would have been forgotten decades ago.<br /><br />"Daniel's" mother also does an excellent job, deftly managing to portray a total airhead without so much as a hint that anything is wrong.  (What DID happen to Daniel's father, anyway?)<br /><br />To my mind (and time will tell) this re-make of "Rocky" is, oddly enough, a lot better than the original!  That doesn't happen very often!<br /><br />A very high recommendation, especially if you are getting tired of films full of nothing but explosions.

 | product/productId: 0800185684 | review/userId: AMKZHBOK7VMQR | review/summary: You CAN smell the food while watching | review/text: This is a beautiful movie on a number of levels. As many reviewers have noted already the Italian cooking and the scenes in the kitchen will have you craving a fine Italian dinner as soon as you finish watching.<br />Beyond the food this is a fine film with a very touching story involving two immigrant brothers who are extremely close despite their obvious personality differences. The tension between the brothers builds as they attempt to salvage their struggling restaurant business. Primo (Tony Shalhoub)the older brother has an artistic temperment and that applies to his uncompromising approach to cooking and cuisine. His brother,Secondi(Staney Tucci), has more material ambitions and is manipulated by a competing restauratnt owner into an ill-advised attempt to publicise their restaurant by having an elaborate dinner party for singer Louie Prima. Hence the film revolves around preparations for THE BIG NIGHT.<p>The climax has the conflict between the brothers break out into the open and the film ends with a beautiful sequence in the kitchen where there is a silent reconcilliation.<p>The story is set in a New Jersey shore town in the 1950's. The period is captured beautifully with big-finned Cadilacs cruising down the main street and the women's fashions are right on the money. The soundtrack is absolutely fabulous with cuts from Rosemary Clooney, Louie Prima and some lesser known Italian recording artists.<br />Both Shalhoub and Tucci are excellent in thei roles and the supporting cast is very good as well.<p>Overall I highly reccomend both the film and the soundtrack.

It is something that I imagine Rorschach would have made if he had directed movies. This film is image after image of high contrast depictions that read like solarized images, negative images, that seem to flip back and forth, becoming almost like an ink blot where the imagination begins to take over. Influenced by early black and white films like "Nosferatu" it refers to the dark side of imagination. What is begot is the birth of imagination in this primordial land of primitive fears.<br /><br />This film comes as close to a visually abstract film as I have ever seen.
 | product/productId: 6301942647 | review/userId: A1DHNC125851OZ | review/summary: Kurosawa brings his dreams into reality | review/text: I made the mistake of making this the first Kurosawa movie that I saw. For those who have yet to experience his films, I urge that you hold off viewing this until you see most of his older films. I really don't think  that this film works very well. The three best stories are &quot;Red  Fuji&quot;, where a nuclear power plant meltdown leaves some terrified  survivors; the one where a traveler stumbles across a nuclear-mutated demon  (one assumes this is a direct sequel to &quot;Fuji&quot;); and the last  one, in my opinion, the most beautifully filmed, &quot;Village of the  Watermills&quot;. In it, an old man preaches to a young traveler about life  and death. Like the ones I mentioned, the other stories have excellent  cinematography (maybe the best Kurosawa has ever done -- what with the  vibrant colors and sweeping landscapes), but the problem is, the overall  experience is too disorienting. Kurosawa had difficult getting this one  made and had to call for help from George Lucas (who's Industrial Light  &amp; Magic did the special effects) and Steven Spielberg. It's clear why,  because studios had difficulty understanding the unity of it. Many of  Kurosawa's hard-core fans enjoy this film, but I personally didn't find it  to be all that exciting.

I champed at the bit of my inequity, knowing revenge would someday be mine. Then, I saw this beautiful movie. And I was inspired. Nay! I was uplifted! I knew then the name that I had always wanted to know, but had not spoken, for it was not in my consciousness just yet. I knew: GYMKATA!

 | product/productId: 6300270424 | review/userId: A21ABH6EL5N7WR | review/summary: IN AWE THE ENTIRE TIME | review/text: No other film could have captured the grandeur of Led Zeppelin and incorporated an insight on the band members and their adventures and personalities than "The Song Remains the Same."  Even if you were not a wild child of the 70's (like myself), you got the feel of the times and the concert, and the emotions of the audience leaked through onto you.  It is my favorite movie, because there is nothing I love more than Led Zeppelin.  I laughed, danced, and cried through out this film.<br /><br />The film starts out oddly with Richard Cole in a mob scene and Peter Grant getting tour dates, but is a quiet transition into what the picturesque daily lives of all 4 members are...and it is truly sweet.  For example, Robert is with his kids and wife, as is Jonesy, Bonzo is farming, and Jimmy is playing a hurdy-gurdy in a lovely autumn setting.  But you totally feel the love and overall high of New York City in the 1970's, venturing through out subway tunnels and skyscraping buildings...to the sounds of Zeppelin LIVE!!<br /><br />Each band member has their own scene in which their "theme" song, if you will,is performed and each of them get to be a little dramatic through amateur acting (and they don't do half bad...but their musical performance is a million times better!).  The members and their songs are as follows, along with a brief description of the scene :<br /><br />"No Quarter"-John Paul(A dark horseback rider [Jonesy] in the night, playing a church organ)<br />"Dazed and Confused"-Pagey(Mysterious and insane things that REALLY make you think about your own life)<br />"The Rain Song"-Robert(Dramatic LOTR type acting...but very daring)<br />"Moby Dick"-Bonzo(The maniac himself doing his best)<br /><br />It is a lenghthy movie, but if you are a true fan you will not get bored.  It is so natural, and the concert spectacular, for this is Zeppelin at their peak.  I HIGHLY recommend it, before any concert movie by ANY artist.
 | product/productId: 6300267938 | review/userId: A1345VRK5MYG7 | review/summary: Relentless Pursuit | review/text: The Searchers is probably one of the most analyzed Westerns ever made, so I'm not going to attempt to look at its deeper meaning.  From a purely entertainment point of view, the movie works very well.  John Wayne is  excellent as the tough, driven uncle of Natalie Wood, who goes on a 5 year  quest to find her after her family is murdered and she is kidnapped by  Indians.  Two things about this film standout for me.  One thing is the  relentless pursuit by Wayne and the way one man, for whatever his motives,  refuses to give up or move on without getting what he is after.  The other  standout is the photography.  This must be one of the most beautifully  filmed movies of all time.  The colour and scenery are breathtaking.  Some  of the dialogue and acting (especially Jeffrey Hunter) are stilted and  unbelievable, but they do not interfere in the enjoyment of the movie.  Anyone in &quot;search&quot; of a great, classic Western should be sure to  view this movie.
 | product/productId: 0790742799 | review/userId: A2VE83MZF98ITY | review/summary: Make way for a Marine Corps fighter pilot! | review/text: This is an astonishing film.  As the son of a career military man, I recognised some of the aspects of growing up in such an environment.  The constant moving, the impermanence of things, and the general competitiveness that comes with the atmosphere are very accurately portrayed.  Fortunately for me, my father was not the domineering Great Santini type!<p>Robert Duvall plays a Marine Corps fighter pilot, one of the best of an elite corps, with an ego to match.  His name is 'Bull' Meechum, but he styles himself the 'Great Santini'.  Blythe Danner puts in an exquisite understated performance as the long-suffering yet loving wife, the strong and caring mother.  Michael O'Keefe had what was perhaps the best role of his career as the coming-of-age son, competing with his father yet yearning for love and approval.  Stan Shaw likewise turns in an excellent performance as Toomer, the black local who gets into trouble.  While many of the other supporting cast did not go on to great fame, it is certainly not due to lack of acting ability as shown in this film.  <p>Despite being nearly a quarter of a century old now, the film stands up to the passage of time.  The characters remain believable; the situations and cinematography bear up well.  The film has a timeless quality that qualifies it as a classic, and portrays both the military and southern experience realistically without distortion pro or con.<p>The main drama is between Meechum and his son Ben, but the secondary plot lines are strong without distracting from the primary interaction.  The films ends in a strong, sombre mood, as the respect that has grudgingly built between father and son is finally realised, and the family dynamic continues its slow evolution as the family moves to yet another home at the end.<p>The scene in which Ben, the son, finally beats Bull Meechum at basketball, at anything (Ben mentions it is the first time ANY of the children have beaten him at anything) is classic.  Both Duvall and O'Keefe give strong performances as their respective characters, Duvall the father who is at once proud of his son for succeeding and still angry at his own shortcomings, lashing out at the family, and Ben, who stands his ground to claim his victory, despite the taunting and pettiness of his father.  <p>The DVD version presents no special features to speak of ; it is essentially a video on disc.  However, it is a film that is well worth having in one's collection, and were they available to give, it would get ten stars.

Don't be deceived by the cover, David's only a minor bit in this.<p>The sets and lights are spectacular here, and the music's pretty good.  I like the Sade song.  Some of the British accent's a bit hard to catch, (I turned on the captions for the "Ted's not Dead" song)<p>Disappointing extras, and not even a copy of the film's preview. I'm never really partial to slide shows of promotional photos.  <p>I think this film just came out at a time when musicals weren't popular.  It probably would have fared better if released today.  I'm sure some Broadway producer will be ... over it soon, given their proclivity to turn movies and TV shows into Broadway musicals.
 | product/productId: 0800130936 | review/userId: A6VXZ1EEPRTLV | review/summary: Michael Bay's investment yields huge dividends... | review/text: Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (Beverly Hills Cop, Days Of Thunder, Top Gun), known for a slick over the top approach to action, are behind Bad Boys (1995), a big and loud extravaganza teaming Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, as Miami police detectives on the trail of millions in stolen cash and drugs.  Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers) makes his directorial debut, in this action/comedy, that sort of delivers in the action department, but not so much when it comes to laughs.<br /><br />A gang led by a criminal named Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo), engineers the audacious robbery of millions of dollars of confiscated drugs from the police evidence vault.  During the robbery, one of the team takes a bag of drugs for personal use, and arranges to party with a couple of women in a hotel.  Fouchet arrives, and eliminates his greedy collaborator and one of the ladies, but Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) manages to escape a hail of bullets, by jumping from a roof into a swimming pool.<br /><br />Rich playboy Mike Lowery (Smith), and dedicated family man Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are Miami police detectives assigned to work on this most crucial of cases.  Lowery isn't in the office when Julie calls police headquarters, so Burnett impersonates him, and arranges to meet her.  Fouchet's men are close behind, shooting up Julie's apartment, as she and Burnett barely escape to safety with her two pet dogs.  Mott refuses to enter protective custody, so Burnett stashes her at his partner's apartment.  Burnett's boss Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), noisily orders him continue to impersonate Lowery, and get vital information from Julie.  Burnett moves into Lowery's bachelor pad, while Lowery takes up residence in Burnett's home with his wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) and two kids.<br /><br />Much of the remainder of the film is centered on keeping Julie believing that Burnett is actually his free-wheeling partner.  It's a fairly ridiculous situation, as Julie is certainly intelligent enough to handle the truth.  The elaborate charade provides some rather forced and predictable, low level humor.  Lawrence has fairly good chemistry with Smith, who mostly plays the straight man to Lawrence's goofing.  Bad Boys tries hard to be funny, but isn't very successful, despite Lawrence being an accomplished ad libber.  Tea Leoni, as the sharp tongued Julie, seems too bright to be involved in most of the goofiness, and at times seems out of place with her co-stars.<br /><br />The DVD commentary by Michael Bay is highly informative, though sporadic at points.  The director repeatedly states that the studio did not believe in the film, and that he was working under extreme pressure, on a very limited budget, with his directorial future at stake.  Bay says that he even paid the studio out of his own pocket, to shoot a particular scene.  Bay also relates some interesting anecdotes about stars Lawrence and Smith.  Of particular interest is the amount of improvisation that was apparently done, as apparently there were some big problems with the script.  Bay often focuses on the pressure of meeting shooting schedules, and budgetary concerns, but his investment and efforts certainly did pay off.  Bad Boys went on to make over 100 million dollars in profits, and Michael Bay has become one of Hollywood's most in demand directors.<br /><br />A fast paced film with good production values and a cartoonish plot, Bad Boys largely delivers what you might expect from a Simpson/Bruckheimer production.  With Smith and Lawrence trading barbs, this surprise performer at the box office helped launch Will Smith's movie career.  It would be followed by the more explosive and exciting, Bad Boys II in 2003.

It was released amongst a spurt of several 3D films in the early 80s (Jaws 3-D and Parasite featuring a young Demi Moore were the other two I remember).  Indeed, the new "super 3D" process was great - super clear and a lot of depth. However, unless you are able to view in 3-D --unlikely--, this is one of the lamest of the series with one of the lamest endings (although, Dana Kimmel is great at being hysterical and you might get a kick out of the stoned chick and her boyfriend).<br /><br />Special effects were par for the day. But what  happened to Jason's hair from the night before in part 2? LOL. The final chase scene IS fun despite it's corny conclusion. Harry Manfredini's music was mostly re-hashed from parts 1 & 2. The additional/new stuff is typically good, mostly built for the chase scene.<br /><br />Let's face it,  this series trashed itself by NOT taking itself seriously in any way. But, although I was a mere 15, I wanted to know if the producers at Paramount  thought all teenagers were likened to jackasses?
 | product/productId: 0792840887 | review/userId: A9L6L5H9BPEBO | review/summary: Happy Birthday, George! | review/text: One thing I expect on July 4th is something to watch that reminds me of my Yankee heritage. This year, there's no Boston Pops or movies--except one. Someone at a television station had enough consciousness and caffeine to air "Yankee Doodle Dandy" today.<br /><br />This is a musical that tells the story of George M. Cohan a singer, songwriter, and playwright who put his love of America in many of his plays in a way that only an American of Irish heritage can.  James Cagney played George M. Cohan with as much verve and more talent than the original. His tap dancing highlights much of the film in which he demonstrates the ability to have his limbs look like they dangle from the strings of a puppet. His performance also won him the Academy Award for best actor. Songs like the "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (of course), It's a Grand Old Flag," and "Over There" can still give the listener chills of national pride.<br /><br />The story begins with a summons to the White House, George M. tells his story to the president, from his beginnings in Vaudeville, the bonds with his family and partner and his rise to stardom.<br /><br />Rosemary DeCamp, Walter Huston, Jeanne Cagney play his mother, father and sister (who is also his real sister).  Joanne Leslie plays his wife, Mary, and Richard Whorf plays his partner, Sam Harris. They support a script that is a bit campy but reflects the strong bonds the Four Cohans had for each other and his "contractless" partnership with Harris. One of the best lines is George M. Cohan marching beside troops who are singing "Over There," a song he wrote. An officer says to him, "What's the matter, ol' timer, don't you remember this song?"<br /><br />Naturally, the film took license with the facts. Rosemarie DeCamp, who played his mother was nine years younger than (her son), James Cagney. George M. was actually born July 3rd, not the 4th.  He was alos married twice. The last one was named Agnes Mary, but she always went by Agnes.<br /><br />Two years ago I saw George M. Cohan's mausoleum in a cemetery of (other dead)celebrities in Woodlawn, New York. He died in 1942. I eagerly told a much younger man who was an aspiring history teacher. He asked, "Who's that?" I told him some of his achievements, perhaps a bit too emphatically. He defended his ignorance telling me he that he was born in 1984, not 1942. I reminded him that being a history teacher meant knowing about people and events before he was born. It doesn't look like he will become one--thank God!<br /><br />Anyway, Happy Birthday, George! Some of us remember you.<br /><br />Happy Independence Day!

It is so refreshing to see young, mostly unknown actors and actresses, do work of such a high caliber that gives this movie a life of it's own. Even without the stellar musical performances, each one of these thespians brings something to their character that make him or her stand out. As for the musical perfomances; well they elevate this movie to a rock and roll &quot;must see&quot;. To bring such vitality and sincerity to music that was made before most of them were born, well that's like a breath of fresh air to an old rock and roller like me. Is this movie worth owning and treasuring? Well as the Commitments' manager would say; &quot;ABSOLUTELY! NO QUESTION!!&quot;. P.S. The &quot;Treat Her Right&quot; music video, that comes as a extra on this DVD, is icing on a perfect cake.
 | product/productId: 6300267938 | review/userId: A2364DJDJWF5LO | review/summary: It's easy to overlook it's faults | review/text: No doubt about it, The Searchers is a western masterpiece. It's the ONLY film that I can easily overlook it's faults that appear throughout the film. The faults I speak of are the scenes of "cornball" humor that are scattered all through the film. They simply don't work nor belong in this mature and intense film. Humor was NOT John Ford's forte, and he seemed to prefer the cornball variety, and granted, it did work in some of his films, but in The Searchers it was definitely out of place.<br /><br />Amazingly, this film is so spectacular in every other aspect, that forgiving the cornball humor is a very easy thing to do.<br /><br />The Searchers is not only beautiful to look at, but it's beautiful to listen to as well. This film is one of a rare handful that completely captures a specific time, place, mood and atmosphere and will suck the viewer into it's mighty vortex and put them smack dab in the middle of it. It's truly a stunning visual experience with a very complex and absorbing story, and it possesses symbolic gestures that are utilized with skill and effectiveness, never resorting to pretentiousness like most "symbolic" films.<br /><br />What more can be said about John Wayne's perfect performance in the lead role ? He was absolutely, positively born to play this role, and he turns it into a perfection personified experience. It's hard to believe there are a few misguided souls who claim Wayne wasn't a great actor. (this performance especially and several more to his resume makes those naysayers seem like babbling fools)<br /><br />The Searchers has rightfully been acknowledged as an American classic, and a true masterpiece of cinema, and thankfully, it's the film that many have come to admit proved John Wayne as an important actor. (his fans knew it all along)<br /><br />Highly recommended.

 | product/productId: 6302088240 | review/userId: A2VY9BOAVW0GCW | review/summary: The Terminator: The first one in the trilogy is a classic! | review/text: This one started it all.  A story about fate, destiny and what happens when the course of the future is alternated.  You've heard someone say, "if only I could go back in time..."  Well, see this movie and watch what happens as young, innocent Sarah Connors is targeted by a humanoid killing machine from the future sent back in time to terminate her.  As she struggles to make sense of the situation while fleeing for her life, Sarah is assisted by a soldier, also from the future, who volunteers to protect her and to help her fulfill her destiny.  Because this is the first movie of a three movie set, this movie is a bit darker and scarier in terms of storyline than the next two movies that follow.  *For all you guys who are familiar with the early 80's television show "The :20 Minute Workout": Bess Motta, aerobics instructor, has a starring role in the movie as Sarah's roommate.
 | product/productId: 0767802519 | review/userId: A2JA6A2Q7FJJMS | review/summary: Extremely Enjoyable | review/text: There is a difference between things we like and things which are good. The Professional (aka Leon) isn't very good. It's the story of a guy who  gets paid a lot of money to kill people, and there's nothing particularly  revealing or insightful about this. In fact, quite the opposite. The title  character is very cool. Movie assassins are cool. It's neat to watch Jean  Reno shoot people. But it's a comic book, in the very worst sense of the  term. It's utterly unrealistic and the only things that are enjoyable about  it depend entirely on that unrealism. Luc Besson doesn't know any more  about assassins than your dentist does. It's absolutely escapism.<p>That  being said, it's a hell of a lot of fun. Extremely enjoyable. Lots of fun  to watch with your friends, particularly because there's not a lot of  dialog, so you can comment over the action. It's not the type of movie that  you need to own, however. It's so broadly drawn, exactly like a cartoon,  that as soon as you *think* about it, much less look at the cover of the  movie, everything in it instantly comes back to you, and you'll find  yourself looking for something that's even minutely rewarding to watch more  than once.<p>Gary Oldman, on the same really dedicated drug binge that  carried him through most of the 90s, is just one notch too high. It's  possible to see that he could have turned in a performance that would scare  you, but he opted to play it over the top. This was probably a bad idea,  although he'd ratchet it up even further in The 5th Element.<p>When this  movie first came out, many reviewers were disturbed by the relationship  between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. Others tried to dismiss this by  claiming it was familial rather than romantic. Both sides are wrong. Leon  has the mind of a child. Intellectually and emotionally, he's younger than  Natalie Portman's character. Their relationship is puppy love, so it's  romantic in whatever limited sense puppy love can be, but that's all.  There's nothing morally dangerous here, no-one's going to be corrupted by  this movie, except insofar as it might lead them to confuse things they  like with things that are good.

This movie is an excellant movie.  Al Pacino's acting in this film is incredible and nobody can deny that.  If you like films with a lot of good &quot;one liners&quot; that you can walk around and quote with a bunch of your friends than this is what you are looking for as long as you don't mind the language and the violence.  It is not a happy film, it is very depressing, which is why many of the people here give it a bad rating.  If you pay attention to the movie it will make good sense.  It is a 1983 movie and it certainly beats alot of todays movies.  Watch this movie and then try a recent movie released in 2000, I think you will feel that you are being deprived of the entertainment you deserve.

The film could have been funny and it is just entertaining. The film could have been deep and thoroughly thought and it ends like a corny story for grown-up flunkies at the back of the classroom. Why did he miss all the potential of his situation ? Because he wanted to demonstrate something : extreme right racist ideas are bad and lead to crime, and nothing but crime, and crime leads to wasting one's life, and only wasting it. It is too obvious the film advocates staying right in the middle of the bull's eye of the squarest society one can imagine. Square and nothing but square. I must admit I prefer circles, stars of all types and golden rectangles, but squares are too simple for my complex mind. If you want to enjoy yourself somewhat without using your head too much, do watch this film and you will be able to noisily crunch many cookies without losing too much of the  lyrics .<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne

It was not my first Tarkovsky movie, but I found it disjointed, confusing, incohesive, etc.  I even thought of turning it off in the middle and giving up on it.  But as I thought about it the next day, the meanings and symbols slowly became clear.  What was confusion and exasperation the night before turned into intrigue and curiosity the next day.  I actually watched the entire movie again the next night.  What I discovered was a beautifully and poetically created masterpiece that discards the narrative structure in place of disjointed memories and images.  The film is more like a painting in that to understand it each portion of the canvass must be mulled over and revisited to get the true impact.<br />The images in this film are absolutely stunning and unforgetable; the burning barn, milk dripping from an overturned glass...<br />It may go without saying but this film is for those interested in film as art and not film as blockbuster entertainment.  In fact, I'm sure that if this film were shown even in an art house half of the audience would get up and walk out.

 | product/productId: 6300183947 | review/userId: ANVV2173XS7GD | review/summary: A Haunting Love Story | review/text: Marnie is one of those movies that stays with you forever. Even if you don't absolutely love Hitchcock, this little gem is worth watching. Yes, it is suspenseful in that most unique Hitchcock way, but it's the love story that captivated me the most. The lovely Marnie (played brilliantly by Tippie Hedren) is such a complex character that viewers alternately become enthralled with, frustrated by, and inevitably heartbroken for her. Marnie has never recovered from a traumatic childhood and she remains that traumatized little girl in a woman's body. She is still a little girl desperately searching for love, only she doesn't realize it. The only love she knows is her horse. And Sean Connery as Mark Rutland. Wow! He is every girl's "Knight in Shining Armor" as he tries to come to Marnie's rescue. The expressions on Mark's face as he looks at Marnie seem so genuinely real. It seems he would do anything for Marnie to help her get better and to make her love him. Louise Latham as Marnie's mysterious mother is also excellent. A haunting, beautiful love story. Highly recommended!

 | product/productId: 630018174X | review/userId: A3H9JSM1SUTE4O | review/summary: HOLMES GOES TO REHAB! | review/text: Adapted by Nicholas Meyer's from his clever 1974 novel, this is certainly among the most faithful iterations of Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional detective.  The Herbert Ross directed film has Holme's loyal sidekick and chronicler Dr. John H. Watson (Alan Arkin) seeking the help of Dr. Sigmund Freud (Robert Duvall) in finding a cure for Holmes' debilitating cocaine addiction.  Nicol Williamson portrays Holmes as an authentic addict, alternately hyper and depressed with manic episodes that suggest he has truly lost touch with reality.  There's no tongue in cheek, winking at the audience here, but a solid piece of entertainment with the brilliant Holmes on the brink of losing his great mind to an obsession that leads to no solution but madness and death.  The three lead actors are all excellent - Vanessa Redgrave has a supporting role -- and Williamson's drug addled Holmes is unforgettable.  This fascinating film is long overdue for the a full Blu-ray restoration.
 | product/productId: 1404973605 | review/userId: ACMJLCPX5FMBK | review/summary: Not all it's cracked up to be | review/text: My husband and I were slightly disappointed with Guess Who.  With Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac, we were expecting constant hilarity.  Don't get me wrong.  It was funny.  We did laugh quite a bit.  However in this day and age, a movie that relies on racial bashing continues to tell us it's ok to judge people on the color of their skin.  Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and Theresa (Zoe Saldana) were a happy, in love bi-racial couple.  From the moment Simon arrived at The Jones home he was judged solely his race.  When his girlfriend's father thought he was black everything was wonderful.  Simon was all but forced to tell "black jokes" at a family dinner and when one was told that the Jones's didn't like, he was almost lynched.  Simon never had an issue with his girlfriend's African-American heritage.  The Jones family obviously had an issue with his heritage.  Eventually, Simon is accepted in to the family after his relationship is almost destroyed by a judgemental family.  In this day and age we are supposed to be teaching our children racial equality and practicing that ourselves.  Do we have it now? No.  With movies like this, we never will.

 | product/productId: 6300270424 | review/userId: A12FBW7EX7G62Q | review/summary: HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!!!!! | review/text: I'd discourage anyone's interest for any of these performances (VHS or DVD are both of bad quality). The sound and picture quality has to be the WORST I've ever heard from any live band. The sound is flat and gets drowned out easily. No matter how far sound quality standards have changed since the 1976 release of this movie, the sound remains as horrible as ever. As far as the picture, I've done better framing with my home camcorder.  As a TV and movie viewer in the 21st century, I've been too used to seeing several frames per minute, while this movie often shows the entire stage of the band playing instead of cutting to different frames, and belive me.. you'll go CRAZY.  In addition, the DVD is exactly the same as the VHS since it was originally recorded with [bad] analong systems in 1973 and is practically incapable of a good remaster. DO NOT BUY THIS. I was very disappointed as a big fan of Zeppelin to say the least. It is NOT worth the money. To add to the poor sound quality, the band played pretty poorly too. Some renditions were way too long and needlessly draggy. I understand the improvisational culture of blues music, but .... Robert's voice is also very weak and stripped and you almost NEVER see John Paul Jones. (Did Robert and Jimmy eternally hate that guy or what?).  The whole movie has been over rated since it's the only official Zeppelin live performance (I'm talking the REAL band with Bonham and all).  The Stairway to Heaven performance is very over rated too.  I was so disappointed in that.  I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack either, since it's the same songs with the same POOR quality.  It also lacks the live version of "Black Dog" which was one of the only decent renditions in the whole movie.<br />For new Zeppelin fans, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.  It will only turn you off from the band completely since it does NO justice to their real power and talent.  For older fans... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br />To sum it up, it's just a HORRIBLE movie and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. No wonder it bombed at the box office in 1976.

With lessons on morality, modest humor, and triumphant hope amid the struggle against oppression and despair, this film is a treasure to be watched repeatedly!<br /><br />The acting, writing, and direction are all excellent. The cinematography and location scenes are all beautiful! My only problem with the film is that its translataion onto tape caused it to jiggle on the screen.

 | product/productId: 0767832566 | review/userId: A1ODJ4ERVMWNJ1 | review/summary: AN OVERLOOKED MASTERPIECE | review/text: You run into them once in a while: movies that have never seen the big screen, or seen it very briefly, that turn out to be wonderful.<br /><br />This movie is pseudo-noir and a parody of noir rolled into one. It is a comedy with some pretty tragic moments, a kidnapping for ransom movie that's also a spoof and a genuine love and betrayal story. It is truly artistic (in my view, in the entire history of cinematography to date, there may be about twenty films I would classify as art, in all genres, and the actual genre doesn't really matter).<br /><br />The screenplay is magnificent, the casting adequate, the acting occasionally brilliant, and the director knows what he's doing. It's one of those movies I can watch a number of times without getting bored. The cast (surprisingly star-studded) really enjoys this one - their enthusiasm is obvious, they perform with gusto.<br /><br />With France shooting one piece of ... after another (they've been doing this for the past fifteen years, and all their flicks seem to use the same screenplay in which absolutely nothing of note ever happens), Italy more or less silent, Russia becoming provincial, with all those "exotic" Asian productions that always get the maximum number of stars in reviews because the stupid racist critics feel the "little brother" needs encouragement, with Hollywood mired in a movie version of corporate bureaucracy, with the indies sucking up to Hollywood, and so on - this one is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />If you don't find yourself totally excited by it, well, stick to shlock, I guess.

While I didn't walk away thinking my life had been changed, I did think that being entertained while watching something that was making a social critique is better with believable character interaction and good directing. The three major characters worked well together presenting some interesting and at times exhilarating dynamics. I am also very impressed with Amenabar's contributions, writing and directing a movie is an impressive feat for anyone, especially making it enjoyable to sit through in your first major production.

 | product/productId: 6302308208 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: A grim soap opera with Ronald Reagan's finest performance | review/text: &quot;Kings Row&quot; is the most distinguished film of Ronald Reagan's actor career, for which he drew his best reviews. However, by the time it was released in 1942, Reagan was in the Army and his film career had received a fateful interruption that would eventually lead to his shifting to a political career. I remember that when Breshnev was preparing to meet with President Reagan the Soviet leader screened several of Reagan's films, and &quot;King's Row&quot; was the one that impressed him. If you have already seen this film, directed by Sam Wood, you know why.<p>The film focuses on five childhood friends who grow up to complicated lives. Parris Mitchell (Robert Cummings) has become a medical student, studying privately with Dr. Alexander Tower (Claude Rains), whose daughter Cassandra (Betty Field) is a sheltered neurotic. Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman) has been raised by harsh parents who warn here away from playboy Drake McHugh (Reagan), who is living off an inheritance. Drake ends up falling for Randy Monoghan (Ann Sheridan), the former tomboy who has grown up in to a most practical working class girl. Things then get very dark. First, when Dr. Tower discovers Cassandra is pregnant he kills her and himself. Then, after losing his fortune and taking a job at the railroad yard, Drake is injured and Dr. Gordon (Charles Coburn) decides to amputate the young man's legs as a punishment for his former hedonism. This is what leads to Reagan's unforgettable scene when he wakes up and discovers what has been done to him. The scene could have become ludicrous, but Reagan pulls it off and it is clearly his finest moment as an actor. <p>&quot;Kings Row&quot; is based on the novel by Henry Bellamann, which is a massive story of sadism and thwarted love in what was clearly the &quot;Payton Place&quot; of its day, set in a quiet Midwestern town at the turn of the (last) century. A lot of the novel's elements, such as incest, homosexuality and euthanasia were never going to make it into the film forcing screenwriter Casey Robinson to salvage what he could (e.g., turning the incest between Dr. Tower and his daughter Cassandra into a question of insanity). Robinson also gave the movie a &quot;happier&quot; ending (originally, Drake McHugh dies of cancer after his legs are unnecessarily amputated). Even more radical was the casting, since few in Hollywood were comfortable with Sheridan, Cummings and Reagan having the three lead roles. However, all of them perform admirably, as does Field and the supporting cast of veteran character actors. <p>Reagan would go on to entitle his autobiography &quot;Where's the Rest of Me?&quot; after the famous line he screams when he awakens to discover his legs are gone.  He often told the story about what it was like to film the scene, his worried preparation for him to find the moment in him as an actor and director Wood waiting for Reagan to give the go ahead.  For his parent, Reagan always credited Ann Sheridan, who was not supposed to be in the scene.  But when he suddenly started calling for Randy she rushed into the room in character and Reagan delivered a powerful scene.
 | product/productId: 0783112610 | review/userId: A3FZ06XRKW5JC5 | review/summary: Mildly engaging and amusing, rather forgettable movie | review/text: This is the Hollywood take on the history of the boob job. There are obviously at least two films someone with this particular brief might set out to make. The one is quite interesting, a piece of social history in which all kinds of interesting themes could have been explored. The other is a brilliant excuse to put an abundance of t & a (well, t anyway) on the screen, perhaps under the cover of a more serious movie purporting to be a piece of social history, etc. The second of these movies is what Lawrence O'Neil has mostly made. There is indeed an abundance of t on the screen. And there is a piece of not very strong drama limping alongside it. For the first half, this is more or less comedy and the two doctors Saunders (Schwimmer) and Larson (Cooper) try to sell their ideas for breast implants to their suspicious, offended and perplexed colleagues and potential patients. This is sometimes mildly amusing may be the most effective aspect of the film. Then it turns a bit darker as Saunders and Larson hit the top and start to quarrel and quite a lot darker as things sink into death, divorce and the litigation and recrimination of those who claim to have been harmed by the implants. While as comedy it is intermittently mildly effective, as drama however it's pretty shallow and forgettable and as social comment trite. Running through the film is footage from a fictional documentary about breast implants in which a parade of women appear on camera, talk a little bit about their body image or whatever, all very serious. ... The whole film is really a bit like that. <p>As a slightly titillating drama made in 1997 based around the history of a somewhat squalid industry, in which a comic strand early on is crowded out by darker, more troubling themes as things progress, it has quite a lot in common with "Boogie Nights". But "Boogie Nights" is a much better movie.

This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, and it comes with a message that even children understand.  In this movie Schwarzenegger plays a movie hero.  One of his biggest fans, a boy, gets sucked into the movie with him.  While in the movie the boy sees first hand that what happens in movies is completely unrealistic.  When Schwarzenegger and the boy get pulled form the movie into real life, the opposite occurs and Schwarzenegger gets to see the real life is not like the movies.  If you get shot, you get hurt and might die.  If you shoot your gun at a car it doesn't explode.  If you punch a window, it actually hurts.  And women in real life?  Well, they're not all super models.  Etc.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that everyone in Hollywood wanted to be in and so there are loads of very famous actors and actresses in it.  It's funny.  It's exciting.  It's very tongue-in-cheek.

Gotta love the Resistance.<br /><br />On the whole, the other reviewers have pretty well nailed it. Not the greatest war movie ever made and weak in many areas, but it still manages to retain a charm of its own, and the scenes in wartime London in which the streets are full of men and women uniform, are very well put together.<br /><br />It was a remarkable time, however dangerous and tragic, and watching the chemistry between Ford and Down, you can understand how the US troops who had been stationed in England took home 100,000 war brides.<br /><br />Sweet movie, and well worth the price.

 | product/productId: 6300182614 | review/userId: A1FC6VDKRZ2Y2S | review/summary: A disappointing end to a great career | review/text: It's hard to believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. If this is any indication, Hitch was beginning to lose it at the end of his life, and bowed out just in time.<br /><br />Even Hitchcock couldn't save a bad script, which is 90% of the problem - his quality control seems to have been totally shot when he read it and thought it was a good idea. It's not so much the structure of the plot -- Hitch could have easily worked within its comedy/drama/mystery setup. Plot holes abound (for example, a jeweler's home with ZERO burglar alarms?), but these could have been tightened up with a few script revisions.<br /><br />However, the dialogue and characterizations are simply atrocious. The dialogue has way too many profanities and little of the wit, style and real humor of most of Hitchcock's classic scripts. The two "heroes" are totally unappealing, and the acting doesn't help. Barbara Harris' Blanche is supposed to be ditzy and cute, but her performance makes her shrill and stupid. George, played by Bruce Dern, comes across as a boorish, vulgar jerk. It's hard for them to establish any romantic chemistry when they spend most of their time bickering.<br />On the other hand, William Devane and Karen Black, as the villains, come off as wooden and lifeless . My wife was rooting for all four of them to buy the farm at the end!<br /><br />Hitchcock's direction is uninspired. There is one interesting shot (the graveyard sequence) but, at best, we've seen it before (the out of control car). The film looks like a tacky 70's TV movie or a poor episode of "McMillan and Wife", rather than a film from one of history's great directors. And the ending, to say the least, is anticlimactic and dumb.<br /><br />This one is only for Hitchcock completists and those who want to see every one of his films, like my wife and me. But do NOT let this be your first Hitchcock movie, or you might never want to see another. Go for "Psycho", "The Birds", "Strangers of a Train" or "North By Northwest" instead.

There was a page showing a picture of Valentino as The Sheik, I was hooked, I was only 10 years old.  Now I finally got the opportunity to see him in his most famous role of all, "The Sheik" and as a bonus "The Son of The Sheik".  Both are silent movies but there is no need for dialog, when Valentino appears there is no one else there, only him.  His magnetism is incredible, his presence absolute, no doubts about it, there is/was something about him I cannot explain, something unique, a force that drives you to imagine what it would be or was being in his arms, and those eyes only looking at you.  I understand why women all over the world fell for him.

A story often told but never better than in this version.  If you love old movies and Criterion's loving remastering of them, this is a keeper for any collector's library.  The story of a man accused by his fellow soldiers -- and friends and his fiancee -- of cowardice on the eve of war when he resigns his commission and then sets to prove something to himself is a timeless tale.  Forget the other versions, this is the one to have.  Blu Ray brings out the beauty of the early Technicolor photography and with a sweeping score by Miklos Roza. 1939, a year that also saw GONE WITH THE WIND, THE WIZARD OF OZ, DODGE CITY, STAGECOACH, ROARING TWENTIES, GUNGA DIN, BEAU GEASTE, INTERMIZZO, DARK VICTORY, DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, YOUNG MISTER LINCOLN, DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK and too many other acknowledged classic films.  This one stands well with all the rest. Get it. Trust me on this one.  You will not be disappointed. Extras include an interview with director Zoltan Korda's son and a featurette from 1939 on the making of the film.  Hey, it has the grand old crusty stalwart C. Aubrey Smith and John Clements and Sir Ralph Richardson.  All are long gone but what they did lives on.  Well it should.

It was with great dissapointment and some anger that I discovered that the producers of the DVD have shortened the movie, eliminating most of the scenes of violence and basically rendering it a collection of nice shots of the Utah mountains.  This has been done without explaination, apology or even warning; the movie is now less than two hours long (but with intermission intact) and contains many clumsy cuts in the last third, during the indian fighting scenes.  The remaining film still contains a shadow of the original epic but I wish it had remained intact.

 | product/productId: 0792147448 | review/userId: A2R1HAXRNU0QX7 | review/summary: Exciting and believable | review/text: A youngish couple (Kurt Russell & Kathleen Quinlan) are moving from Massachusetts to California, and somewhere in the southwestern desert, their new SUV breaks down.  A friendly trucker comes along, offers help, and Quinlan accepts a ride to a nearby diner to call for help while Russell waits with the car.  He gets the car started on his own, and heads to the diner.  His wife is nowhere to be found, and when Russell catches up with the trucker, the trucker denies any knowledge of the knowing him or his wife.<p>That's the setup that takes place in the first twenty minutes or so.  After that, BREAKDOWN is a thriller as Russell, a meek man driver by desparation, tries to figure out what has happened to his wife with very little evidence to go on.  There are chase scenes galore.<p>The situation is actually quite preposterous, and gets more so as the movie goes along.  The scheme that is uncovered is very elaborate, and seems like an awful lot of trouble for the culprits to go through.  But Kurt Russell is so down to earth and believable, and the bad guys actually quite mundane, that the plot somehow doesn't seem totally ridiculous.  The movie, obviously fairly low budget, is gritty and not too glossy.  There aren't too many explosions, but there are PLENTY of cliffhangers, and because we can so readily identify with Russell's character, thanks to his convincing performance, we really feel for him and what he is going through.  Situations that might seem like minor jeopardy in something more grandiose (like a DIE HARD movie, perhaps) are very tense and exciting in BREAKDOWN.<p>As I said, Russell is very good.  It's interesting that this actor, who has been "famous" since a teen, is so convincing playing an "everyman" type.  He's handsome, but not too much so, and when he runs around crazily, or is involved in a chase scene, he doesn't just suddenly develop amazing abilities.  He looks scared, dirty, sweaty and ticked off.  He is a man driven by shear fear for his wife, and anger.  It's a convincing performance,and one of his best.<p>Quinlan, who understandably isn't in much of the movie, is also very good, and is a convincing match with Russell.  JT Walsh, the main bad guy, is very good because he never really drops the veneer of being a regular guy,except in a couple of scenes.  This was the wonderful character actor's last movie, and he left with a doozy.<p>This movie didn't do to well at the box office, but word of mouth has really helped it out on video.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  It is rated R, but the main reason for that is not graphic violence (there's not much blood, really) but just an occasional outburst of bad language.  It's a thriller that would work well for those who don't like a lot of gore and gunplay.

Sometimes the movie outshines the book, not the case with this one as other reviewers stated if you read the book you were aware of what was missing.  Gave it to my mom to watch, she hadn't read the book so she enjoyed it very much.  Overall a pleasant movie.

I personally think this one is the best of all the Lampoom's movies. Clark and his family are preparing for a great Christmas together with their parents when Uncle Eddy and his family unexpectantly arrive. From their everything goes downhill for Clark. (again) Hilarious movie, but does unfortunately have some language to it. (I won't write any examples) But overall this movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I highly recommend it for any National Lampoom fan!

This is defintiely a disc to add to your collection if you're a fan of this movie. It also includes the excellent commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, who has a great time watching the film again. It also includes a scene-specific PIP commentary by everyone else involved. Excellent, EXCELLENT disc.
 | product/productId: 0790739909 | review/userId: A3IQEZK22MMVWZ | review/summary: It's not a remake.  It's a retelling. | review/text: "Wings of Desire" is among of my favorite movies.  To say that "City of Angels" is a remake of "Wings of Desire" is wrong.  It is a retelling. "City of Angels" in my opinion was not as profound as "Wings of Desire". It lacked the impact of how Angels were portrayed and focused more the underlying theme of love.  Which brings me to my point that "City of Angels" is just a love story.  And a fairly decent love story it is by Hollywood standards. If I had never seen "Wings of Desire" then I would've probably liked this movie more.  But being a fan of "Wings of Desire" has somewhat heightened my expectations of movies that portray Angels.  In "Wings of Desire" the Angel that chose mortality used love as an inspiration to desire all that life has to offer.  While in "City of Angels" the Angel there chose mortality because he fell in love with a mortal woman.  It is not as deep and inspirational as "Wings of Desire". They are two very different movies.

I saw this movie about 8 times when it came out when I was little and was loved it so much. It's full of adventure, great songs, and a story about wanting to belong that children and adults can both relate to. The performances are great. One of Carol Burnett's best. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it now.
 | product/productId: 0790743523 | review/userId: A3BSS2M2DPPV4T | review/summary: POWERFUL TALE OF GREED | review/text: A rather difficult movie to classify, (it takes place in 1920, so it's not a classic western which many seem to think) THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE is Hollywood storytelling at it's best. The performances are uniformly  excellent with Huston perhaps giving the best (he won the AA) and our man  Bogie having a great time. Tim Holt was perhaps less an actor than a  presence, but what a presence! Like most of John Huston's films, the movie  deals with a harsh, masculine envirnment and is concerned with men under  pressure. Huston's most remarkable single achievement is that he focuses  all of the symbolic elements as finely as light rays through a magnifying  glass! A classic excursion into men's minds, this film has had many  imitators yet the original has never been duplicated. Both Walter Huston  and John Huston won AA for best supporting actor and director respectively  at the 1949 awards!

 | product/productId: 6301257006 | review/userId: A27H3B7JKOX6LQ | review/summary: Starting to look like the country today | review/text: This film is starting to look depressingly similar to the current business ethos of this day.  Don't believe me? View the film and then watch CNBC during the day and listen to some of the philistines that rave on about how good it is that American jobs are moving overseas and how  the trade deficit with China is nothing to be alarmed about, even if they are upgrading their military with the income and even though one of their generals threatened to nuke us this week. While watching CNBC I often think of this film.  Where do these philistines come from and how is it that we watch the decline of our country like some deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car at night?  I am not suggesting that they are extraterrestrials but they sure as hell aren't patriots, I don't care how many American Flags they wear on their lapels.<br /><br />Greed and narcissism, which have taken over our culture, are right out of this film's basic theme. Carpenter was truly a prophet when he made this film 17 years ago.  It is an allegory for our time.  I highly recommend it.
 | product/productId: 0792147391 | review/userId: AL6JH1MR37Z25 | review/summary: Swell Beverly storyline!!!! | review/text: Swell episode!!!  Captures the true Beverly...sensitive, perceptive, strong-headed, very quiet, and dignified.<br /><br />In this episode, Beverly is the first to realize that the visiting scientist Jobrill's "accident" with Reyga's experiment was no "accident"; sharp Bev can tell intuitively that there was sabotage involved.<br /><br />But no one believes her, especially since Reyga, the Ferengi scientist, is not taken seriously by most others.  Beverly is going though her own stressful time in this season, but still manages to reach out and help Reyga.<br /><br />Beverly is ordered to drop the matter and sweep it under the rug and pretend along with the others that it was all an "accident."<br /><br />But sensitive Beverly just can't and so risks defying orders and her position in Starfleet to expose the truth.<br /><br />All this adds to Beverly's tension and misery, even when Deanna tries to soothe her, Deanna needs Guinan for backup.<br /><br />There are lots of good Guinan/Beverly scenes, especially after Guinan goes to see Beverly under the pretext of having "tennis elbow."  Touching how intuitive Guinan figures out that poor Beverly is down in the puddle and that her self-esteem could use a boost, so she tells Beverly that she's particular about her doctors and will not just see "any" doctor, but will only see Beverly since she knows Beverly's the best.<br /><br />This does ease Beverly's pain and stress a tad and she does open up to Guinan.<br /><br />Guinan is also valuable in mobilizing a depressed, discouraged Beverly to press on with her questioning in the face of opposition and even being threatened and shoved roughly.<br /><br />I suspect both Guinan and Deanna sensed that Beverly was really going through a hard time this season and was a near mess by this point.  Those two as well as Beverly, knew that despite it being the 24th century, there was still some sexism that had not been completely eradicated and they knew how important it was for them to stick together and stand by one another.  It was beautiful to see Deanna and Guinan stand by Beverly, especially in this latest ordeal.<br /><br />I also suspect that's why Beverly went to bat so strongly for Reyga; Ferengis also were discriminated against and thought "dumb" and were assumed to be bad scientists in a very similar fashion that some people of the 20th century mistakenly thought that women made "bad" scientists...Beverly had felt the sting of sexism in the same way.<br /><br />Very interesting episode with a surprise twist at the end.  I also like that Beverly rescues herself in the end from the clutches of the real villain (watch it to see who it is) and in an unexpected way, does make and contribution to the field of science in both her own and Reyga's names.<br /><br />It's a shame that some people mistakenly think Beverly is "boring" because she's so quiet and reserved; I think just the opposite...she's the most interesting member of the senior crew, despite being the quietest one.
 | product/productId: 0783233086 | review/userId: A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F | review/summary: "An A+ Film" | review/text: "Fried Green Tomatoes" is an ensemble film about a group of women living in the rural south in a town called Whistle Stop. Starring Oscar winners Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy, the movie co-stars Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart-Masterson, all performing in roles that were tailored made for the actresses. Bates stars as a woman who has reached middle age and is being taken for granted by her husband. While visiting a nursing home she befriends an elderly lady, played by Tandy, and the two become each other's confidant. Parker and Masterson play women who eventually fall in love at a time when homosexuality wasn't accepted or permitted. The movie was based on the novel, "The Whistle Stop", written by TV comedian and personality Fannie Flagg, best known for her stint on the '70's gameshow "Match Game". The movie was both a critical and commercial success, grossing nearly $120,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD comes with commentary, an excellent documentary on the film called "Moments of Discovery" featuring interviews with the cast, plus more.
 | product/productId: 6301661710 | review/userId: AK81WLVD5KGUX | review/summary: Better than the book, the rest of the series, and the remake | review/text: Pierre Bouelle's novel was good; the rest of the movie series ranged from okay to abysmal, and the remake was adequate (and arguably more faithful to the novel). But the 1968 version of _Planet of the Apes_ is just one of those _great_ moments in SF film history that nothing else can touch.<p>Charlton Heston is magnificent in the first of his three well-known 'last man' movies (the other two being _The Omega Man_ and _Soylent Green_, which are also nonrepeatable classics). The makeup is excellent, especially for 1968. But it's the brilliant script (for which Rod Serling shares a co-credit) that raises this film to its iconic status.<p>This is the sort of thing that 1960s cinematic SF (including the original _Star Trek_ series) tried to pull off and rarely managed to succeed at. This film is a carefully constructed drama, a meditation on human nature, and a two-hour morality play -- backed by a wonderfully evocative Jerry Goldsmith score. The 'science' in its science fiction is nothing to write home about, but its digs at human culture, religion, and species-centered pride work every bit as well today as they did in the latter portion of the turbulent '60s. <p>On the off-chance that there's somebody out there who doesn't know how it ends -- despite the fact that (duhh) a shot from the _final scene_ appears on the DVD cover -- I won't describe the Big Finale. But man, oh, man, even when you _know it's coming_, Heston still pulls it off. The closing moments _never_ fail to grab me.<p>And this mind-wrenching ending was specifically created for this film. It's not in the book and it's not in the remake.<p>The widescreen-format DVD is nicely done. If it's not in your collection already, get it at once.

 | product/productId: 0783204914 | review/userId: A2GYX971VETQBV | review/summary: &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;: A much deserved Oscar for Al Pacino | review/text: "Scent of a Woman" finally won Al Pacino the award for Best Actor-an honor that, in my opinion, escaped him far too long.  His performance is wonderful, supplemented with the interesting dialogue that seems to be almost ad-libbed by Pacino himself.  Perhaps his acting is larger-than-life, but the character demands such a performance.  Frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to see the role fall apart in the hands of someone less experienced.  <p>The film does remind one of "Dead Poet's Society," but quickly diverges into a rich character exploration while both Lt. Col. Slade and Charlie live it up in New York City.  One question I have for the defense of Charlie: why, in the end, does he want to be associated with the institution that grinds against his principles?  It seems that Slade's advice should be for him to join an institution that he feels proud to be a part of.  Regardless, the ending scenes of the film are wonderful to watch time and time again, particularly if you enjoy moving speeches as much as I do.  <p>The film is a bit long; it has several climaxes that confuse the audience as to when the film should end.  But this film is worth watching, if only to hear Pacino speak about women in a way that completely validates his character.

(TKM (Legacy Series Edition) (1962) | review/text: To Kill a Mockingbird rates my highest rating possible on at least three levels.<br /><br />1. The film and screenplay are superbly adapted from the Harper Lee Novel. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch. The child actors Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are natural and very believable. Robert Duvall almost steals the show without even one word of dialoge.<br /><br />2. The disc and it contents are unbelievable and add true value to a already GREAT FILM. There is just a bit of redundancy in some of the documentary materail but this can be forgiven. The "A Conversation with Gregory Peck" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.<br /><br />3. To Kill a Mockingbird in either book and film form provides us true examples of the best and the worst tendencies of mankind.<br /><br />Atticus Finch for instant is what every Father should be and is the lawyer we would want defending us if we were in trouble. On the other hand Mr. Ewell is the devil himself.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be viewed many times if for no other reason than to remind us of what fine filmaking can be.
 | product/productId: 5559563684 | review/userId: A38QJ7JUUTVLKX | review/summary: 3.5 stars | review/text: Wow, this was an incredibly corny but funny movie. Sometimes it was gut burstingly funny, but towards the end it gets really stupid. The scene where Ferrel is singing (spreading christmas cheer) is priceless. I was in tears! It is a silly but fun movie. Will Ferrel stars as Buddy, a human orphan raised as an elf in Santa's workshop, grows up in the land of Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials. Candy cane trees, gingerbread houses and an animated talking snowman are this boy's life. His odyssey to find his biological father, a cynical publisher on Santa's naughty list, takes him out of the land of sugar plum diets and into the bustling streets of New York City. He meets dad, dad thinks he's a nut, takes him in, other son befriends him, dad get's mad at buddy after buddy innocently mistakened a midget for an elf (yet another gut burster) and says some unkind words, son finds buddy, santa crashes in central park, and they all help santa and save christmas. Now that I just ruined the movioe for you, you should still see it. It's no A Christmas Story, but it is a fun and enjoyably silly comedy for the whole family to enjoy.
 | product/productId: 630229343X | review/userId: A2GPRA9HHLOC4B | review/summary: 2-3 stars tops and it hurts to say it | review/text: Being a big Python fan, I was in a local office store and they had a random DVD rack. I saw Jabberwocky and was like, "YES!!". I snatched it up, went directly home and popped it into the player. I love both stupid, toilet humor and smart humor. But...I was disappointed from the start. I hate to say that but I have to be honest. Here is why.<br />- Timing/pace: The primary disappointment was the comedic timing in this. One minute, you are listening and waiting for the next joke or one liner and nothing happens. It will be drama, drama and more drama. Then, for one example, we get one funny line after another from the dingbat princess speaking to her father of her pending suiters. Then, not a whole lot of great humor for a long time. It's so touch-and-go that it is almost frustrating.<br />- The type of humor: We get some occasional good one liners and lead-in's but there are so many VERY subtle jokes or hints at humor that it seemed imbalanced. And some attempts at humor missed the mark entirely. (You said you didn't have any posessions. You have a potato. You can't eat it. It's a momento! A momento? She must really love you.) Come on. This whole scene had me yawning.<br />It does have it's humor and for someone who would like to see the Python's being a little serious, you will like it. But, understand, this is not typical Python. It's not the Holy Grail, Life of Brian or The Meaning of life.<br />2-3 stars in my own opinion.
 | product/productId: 6302035708 | review/userId: A2MF0N72JVXDAP | review/summary: Stinker | review/text: I'm going to be a bit more generous than the other two reviewers because even though this movie is nearly unwatchably bad, it does have some extended nude scenes that probably enticed a few people in their day.<br /><br />You take out a pool scene or two, though, and this stinker deserves to be lost to the sands of time.<br /><br />First of all, the writing is painfully bad. Lots of talk about weed smoking and sex. Wow, that's original. One scene features weed smoking and sex but a musical score that sounds like something out of "The Way We Were."<br /><br />Second of all, the acting is excruciating. One actress plays a dumb girl, but I never decided if she was playing dumb or really living the part. She also puts on a fake voice that will induce vomiting if heard for more than two or three minutes. You have been warned.<br /><br />Third, wow, talk about false advertising: As anybody but a total idiot would know already, the hot girls on the cover are NOT in this film. In fact they very likely weren't even born when this film came out. More disappointing than that is that there isn't anyone in this movie who is even comparable to either woman. What's the opposite of buxom? Buxless? That's what you've got in this movie...quite a bit of toplessless (no bottomlessness), but breasts the size of mosquito bites.<br /><br />The final point is about direction and editing: It's pretty clear that there wasnt' enough story material here to fill a shot glass, so every take is taken out to its absolute final moment. That's how the movie got to 85 minutes, but you'll swear that it's more like 185 ("Hollywood High 2: The Epic"). We see extended cuts of walks on the beach when...yeah, basically nothing occurs. We see 90-second cuts of walks down concrete pathways and up to front doorsteps. We see two-and-a-half-minute cuts of drives across town. We see pacing that will make you wonder who let the 15-year-old non-credit cinematography student from the local community college into the editing room.<br /><br />Some movies are so bad that they're...not good exactly, but fun to watch. This movie is so bad that it's just really, really bad.
 | product/productId: 6301581067 | review/userId: A12R54MKO17TW0 | review/summary: The Complete Metropolis: released by Kino in Nov of 2010 | review/text: This is a review of Kino's The Complete Metropolis (1927) which was released in November of 2010.<br /><br />Briefly, Metropolis is one of the greatest silent movies ever made and everyone who loves movies will appreciate this version.  The influence that this 1927 film has had on the whole history of modern cinema is profound.<br /><br />For those who don't know about the movie.  It is a great early science-fiction morality play/love story, complete with mad scientist and an iconic robot all wrapped around a modern retelling of the Biblical Tower of Babel story for the industrial age.  This movie was inexplicable edited down right after its premi&egrave;re and has suffered at the hands of various film butchers afterwards.  In the 1970's, what was left was very poor quality versions with most of the film cut out and thought lost to history.  Through several persons and institutions, an effort was made to search the world for every piece of existing footage.  Those efforts have resulted (as of 2010) in Kino's Complete Metropolis.<br /><br />Half an hour of footage was discovered after Kino's earlier restoration of Fritz Lang's Metropolis and that footage has been incorporated into this new version.  The discovery of this new footage is a cause for celebration for every movie buff.  With this footage incorporated, whole plot elements have now been restored to this great silent film.<br /><br />The result however is a vast difference in the quality of the footage:  The earlier restoration is pristine while the newly discovered half hour is very poor quality.  This is not the fault of Kino, it is simply the best (read: Only) copy available and Kino worked on that footage as best they could without further loss of picture.<br /><br />Furthermore, although this is titled the Complete Metropolis, there are still at least two pieces missing from the movie.  First, the fight between the mad scientist and the master of the city is still missing.  Most believe that a motivation point was part of this scene (a reason why the Master orders the gates open later in the movie).  That scene is the last important part of the film left to be discovered.  The second part still missing from the film is the scene where we would have seen the Preacher behind the pulpit (later imitated by the thin man).  The fact that these two scenes are missing does not subtract at all from the enjoyment of watching The Complete Metropolis.  We can only hope that these scenes still exist somewhere and will be discovered someday.<br /><br />This version also restores the Original music made for the 1927 release.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />NOTE: Those looking for the 1980's Moroder version of the film (the wildly colorized short version with the Rock n Roll soundtrack) will NOT find it in this release.  However, in 2011, the Moroder version has been re-released on DVD and Blue-ray and it can now be purchased elsewhere (A version I also love and recommend to anyone who loves 1980's rock music).

 | product/productId: 6301681363 | review/userId: A3UDYY6L2NH3JS | review/summary: Don't cut the machine-branch you're sitting on | review/text: This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period. The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

You won't find the popular, swaying palm Waikiki-type hulas with grandmas strumming ukes, but the chanting/percussion hulas of antiquity. There are  some good interview with kumu hula's, or master teachers of hula, and the  only drawback is that they are a bit competitive with one another.  Everybody pushes their own hula school. But this is the real deal hula, a  dying art, and it's inspiring. About 20% of the tape is narration and kumu  hulas being interviewed, and all the rest is the dancing.

The Star Wars movies are distributed on DVD by 20th Century Fox, the same studio which, less than a year after the initial release, cranked out a special edition of The Day After Tomorrow, and which annually re-issues not just Day After Tomorrow and Independence dDay, but Speed, the Die Hard movies, the Abyss, The Sound of Music, and the Alien movies on an annual basis, every year with new cover art, and sometimes with bonus features, sometimes without.  The Indiana Jones movies are distributed by Paramount, which has released at least 2 editions of each of the Star Trek movies, and I am certain that when the new Star Trek movie gets released, we can anticipate a 3rd release of those features, either when Star Trek XI is released theatrically or on DVD.  This summer there is going to be a new 2 disk edition of Batman Begins getting released (I wonder if it will be the same as the old 2 disk edition of Batman Begins) in order to capitalize on the release of The Dark Knight.  This isn't really a marketing ploy by Lucas so much as standard marketing procedure on the part of the studios.  So, everyone who gave this a 1 star for being a re-release, quick, get to the new edition of Batman Begins and give that a 1 star review as well.

She is absolutely right on target as the aging theater legend being threatened by an up and coming young actress. Bette just REVELS in this juicy role. As the young actress,  Anne Baxter is stunning. What a fine actress she was! George Saunders is  wonderful as the acerbic theater critic, and Thelma Ritter gives a bravura  performance as Bette's secretary/dresser/confessor. This movie is filled  with fine acting and witty dialog. It really makes you feel that you are  part of that wonderful &quot;theater world&quot;. If I could I'd give it  ten stars!
 | product/productId: 6301648897 | review/userId: A3ICU13O093OJY | review/summary: An Evening To Cherish | review/text: I was at the taping of this video at the La Mirada Civic Auditorium. It is an evening that is unforgettable and thanks to this tape, I can always have a reminder of this cavalcade of treasures. One ad appeared in the L.A. Times for the $15 tickets to the taping. The ad included a large list of the names of Broadway stars that &quot;might&quot; be there. The tickets sold out in hours. The audience was filled with Broadway musical fanatics not knowing who would appear. When &quot;Miss Ethel Merman&quot; was announced as the opening performer absolute pandemonium ensued and when she sang &quot;Everything's Coming Up Roses&quot; there was awe-struck silence  followed by applause that almost did raise the roof. It didn't let up for the entire performance. As the tape shows, we were present at a performance uniqurly historic. Other reviewers on this site have mentioned some of the highlights of this tape. To me the pinnacle of this concert is Glynis Johns singing the song she introduced (&quot;Send In the Clowns&quot;) wiith her original co-star Len Cariou. This performance includes not only this world-class song but the dialogue that ties it all together. This almost complete scene from Sondheim's &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; is worthy of Shakespeare. It is one of the most moving, funny, charming and gently profound scenes I have ever witnessed. And this is the only video record of it.<p>In short, if you love the American Musical Theatre, this tape is a must.  Buy it and marvel at one of this country's great art forms, now, sadly, fashionably pooh-poohed. But this form will outlast and be appreciated long after most of today's ultra in-things are no longer remembered. Treat yourself to a celebration of one of the U.S.A's many great contributions to world culture.

 | product/productId: 0790738147 | review/userId: A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R | review/summary: I've seen better from everyone | review/text: L.A. Confidential was a good movie, but it wasn't great. Kevin Spacey is always good, but you'll see better Spacey roles in K-PAX, American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Outbreak, and pretty much ANYTHING else with him! He certainly wasn't bad in L.A. Confidential, he just didn't stand out so much. Russell Crowe was fine in this as well. He has certainly improved his performance though with The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind. Guy Pearce was great in this, and he delivered the finest performance of the film. His better roles are Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. Danny DeVito was his typical self. He is never a let down, but his better roles range from Matilda to Batman Returns to Hoffa. And then there's Kim Basinger. I LOVE Kim Basinger, but I have absolutely no idea why she won an Academy Award for this. I would have thought that this was one of her worse performances. Watch anything else with her, and her acting will stand out more than this! She was up against Minnie Driver's performance in Good Will Hunting for the award, and Driver was far more deserving of the award. Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was a fine movie with fine performances, it just was not Oscar-worthy in any way. It wasn't amazing. It isn't a kid movie, and its R rating reflects violence, language, and some brief sexual images. This was fine to watch once.

 | product/productId: 0767014812 | review/userId: A8TZ88OM8YOLW | review/summary: Horatio Hornblower, a Hero for Us All! | review/text: The story is purely English, but the message is quintessentially American; succeed based upon one's own ability, regardless of class or lineage.  Horatio Hornblower (played by Ioan Gruffudd) is brave, intelligent, and as we discover, a natural born leader, and the envy of every man. We all wish we could be like him.<p>This A&E made-for-TV series is an accurate representation of the C.S. Forester novels upon which they are based.  These first four episodes deal with Hornblower's early years as a midshipman after he joins the British Navy when it was the uncontested ruler of the high seas.<p>Episode one sees Hornblower fall under the control of Simpson, an abusive senior midshipman.  Horatio contemplates suicide and desertion, but instead challenges Simpson to a duel.  A cruel twist spares his life - but takes that of his friend.  He later exemplifies himself in battle, and cunningly outsmarts a rival French captain to begin earning the undying loyalty and affection of his men. <p>War with France breaks out in episode two, and Hornblower is transferred to the British frigate, the Indefatigable, commanded by Captain Pellew (played wonderfully by Robert Lindsay), who will become, over time, almost a second father to his young charge.  Horatio will again distinguish himself towards the movie's end by risking his life to board a burning fire ship (a blazing vessel sent pilotless and kamikaze style into the British fleet) and diverting it away from the Indefatigable.  Captain Pellew later congratulates him for saving his ship and the lives of everyone on board.  Horatio's pride soars, as does the love we feel for him.<p>In episode three, Hornblower learns much about life - and women - when he and an English Duchess (who is really an actress) are taken prisoners by the Spanish.  A French Captain threatens to reveal them as spies, but the Duchess gives up her honor to preserve their secret.  Horatio is at first disgusted, but then respects her immeasurably once he realizes that her pragmatism has probably saved both of their lives.  Hornblower later displays unquestionable bravery when he leads a rescue party to save sailors stranded offshore during a storm.  His gallantry earns him his freedom, and Horatio gains the distinction of being recognized as a hero in both his own country and by his enemies. <p>In the final episode, the crew of the Indefatigable is asked to assist French Royalist soldiers in an ill-fated attempt to recapture the country from the Republic.  The pomp & circumstance of the well-disciplined British army are used gloriously against the enemy.  And a reinstated French Marquis employs the guillotine to lop off a few heads - but in the end suffers a similar fate.  Horatio falls in love with a beautiful French girl only to lose her.  And he painfully learns that duty -- and the responsibility of leading men in battle -- must always win out over his emotions. <p>This A&E series was a visual and inspirational delight.  Ioan Grufford and Robert Lindsay were both superb.  This four disc set is highly recommended!
 | product/productId: 0792846648 | review/userId: AKL4B0VZTHZCG | review/summary: A Roosevelt 'Rough Rider' | review/text: Having grown up in East Chicago Indiana in the late 50's and having graduated from East Chicago Roosevelt in 1959, the school that is depicted in this movie, I can attest to the accuracy of the place, attitudes and character of the community and school of that era.  However, not explored in this picture was the powerful ethnic religious aspect of life and how that had such a positive influence on our young lives.  And although this film deals somewhat with inter-racial friendships, the Roosevelt of that era was 50% black and the races had respect for each other and got along quite well. To some this picture may seem depressing, but for me 'The Calumet Region's' foundries, steel mills and work ethic of the 1950's were an inspiration. It was a great time and place to grow up. And this movie brought back those feelings of pride.

 | product/productId: 0783225849 | review/userId: A1B9ISLYYCHIVE | review/summary: For a limited time only!  Things The Curmudgeon actually LIKES: Part Two! | review/text: No, faithful followers of my Amazon reviews, you are NOT hallucinating. This isn't a dream and your drink has not been spiked. This is actually a five star review, not my usual trip down Amazon's darker paths to find the worst items available, instead it's a celebration of the great and the good. Five reviews of amazing music and movies that has rocked my world in the past. This is review number two. You are now officially Up To Speed. Let's go.<br /><br />More often than not, sequels aren't as good as the original movies. Some buck the trend of course; Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight Returns, Aliens and, if you're 10 years old, Terminator 2. An accepted rule seems to be though that not only are horror sequels never as good as the original, no-one ever really expects them to be. In fact, in the smug, self-referencing tedium of the Scream franchise (a franchise of diminishing returns itself), someone shouts out that "the horror franchise was destroyed by sequels" and then rattles out that horror sequels need to have more gore and more dead bodies to be effective. Pesky things like plot, characters, acting and pace? Naah. Who needs them, right? It's horror. Just kill teenagers. That's all the genre is good for.<br /><br />More often than not, though, this does seem to be the case. No matter how good the original film was, when it comes to sequels they just seem to be churned out, hoping the goodwill factor generated from the first movie will be enough to shift tickets. It ranges from great films who took their original premise and made it stupid (the Ring, Saw), completely lost what made their predecessor frightening in the first place (Blair Witch, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Exorcist) or, God help us, turned their monsters into "pop culture" figures of fun (witness Friday 13th 007 opening parody or Freddy Kruegar dressing up as the Wicked Witch of the West). In short, and almost universally, horror sequels suck.<br /><br />Except for Psycho.<br /><br />It's a pity that the widely available (in the UK, at least) boxset containing all 4 Psycho movies isn't for sale on Amazon, because that's actually what I'm reviewing today. Here's a franchise that doesn't sink into idiocy, it doesn't replace the central character, it doesn't take Norman Bates out of his motel and into New York or space. It doesn't have rappers as guest stars. What it does have is an intelligent, logical plot that runs through all four movies. The characters, from Janet Leigh's doomed Lila Crane right to Jeff Fahey's badboy scumbag Duane Duke in Psycho III, are all believable, perfectly performed and well written characters.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Anthony Perkin's portrayal of Norman Bates; cripplingly shy and undoubtedly haunted, it's an amazing performance from Perkins, who gives enormous weight and depth to a tragic character. Anthony Hopkins gets (deserved) kudos for his take on Hannibal Lector, but Perkins' Norman remains a criminally under-appreciated part. Timid, gentle and often terrifying, he's arguably horror's greatest acted role.<br /><br />You all know about the original movie, so I won't give too much detail here. Needless to say it's an iconic, ground breaking film, with a score and a scene that will be forever parodied and imitated. Regardless of how well guarded it was in the 60's on its initial release, the twist ending is now so well known to render it moot. No matter. Hitchcock's pacing, from the paranoia of Lila Crane in the opening scenes to the flailing basement light reveal of Bates at the end, is masterful. That much you already know.<br /><br />When sequels are made 20 odd years later and after the original director is dead and buried, you could be forgiven for expecting the worse. But Psycho II remains one of, if not the, greatest horror sequel ever. Instead of starting up again in a new motel or with a different killer, instead Bates returns to his motel, and its in this movie we peel back the layers of Bates and find out just how tortured a soul he really is. Instead of some malevolent serial killer, he's possessed by memories of an abusive childhood, and it's the people around him who are the real bad guys this time. Personal note; I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 12 years old, and the scene where the teenage couple are making out in Norman's basement, only to be caught by "mother", has burned into my consciousness ever since. I can still close my eyes and see that scene. Now that is effective horror.<br /><br />Psycho III introduces new characters to the franchise but still harks back to the earlier movies, and features quite possibly the greatest twist on a classic horror shot. The now infamous shower scene that is mistaken as a hallucinogenic vision of the Virgin Mary is as surprising and inventive a take on a well-worn and recongised horror staple as any I've ever seen. Again, Perkin's painfully shy (but still undoubtedly dangerous) Bates has us actually rooting for the killer, without any winks to the camera or Kruegar-style camp catchphrases.<br /><br />Psycho IV is, admittedly, patchy in places and to the trained eye who has sat and watched all four movies in a row, gets some of the earlier plot details a little muddled. But it's still an entertaining TV movie, big in heart, and finally gives us a glimpse of what growing up with Mrs Bates was really like (Hint: not great) And, hey, if anyone deserved a happy ending, it's Norman Bates.<br /><br />So yes, horror sequels are, more often than not, shoddy imitations of greater films, content to throw blood at a screen and disguise it as being scary. Other notable exceptions to the rule include Dawn of the Dead, Paranormal Activity 2 and The Omen, but The Psycho franchise (ignore the remake) is the best of the lot. A towering central performance through all four films, a smart ongoing story and some genuinely frightening moments make the Psycho Collection I-IV (go get it on eBay) not only a must have for genuine horror fans, but a How To guide for any director wanting to create a frightening franchise. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and board up my shower forever.<br /><br />And that, friends, is part two of five. What comes next? Only one way to find out...

 | product/productId: 079215827X | review/userId: A2LICSQ2IFE3C5 | review/summary: Behind the scenes | review/text: The fourth disc in this set documents the making of the trilogy. It's worth watching, if only to see how the principal actors, producers, and director feel about the films. You can see them react to the production at the moment it happens (thanks to on-set behind-the-scenes video), and see them in interviews reflecting on their work.<p>Harrison Ford is cool under fire throughout. He doesn't say a lot about breaking his back during The Temple of Doom (which shut down the production for months while he had surgery). He takes everything in stride, dedicated and professional but a little bit bored with it all. Spielberg and Lucas are overgrown kids who love making things up (Lucas) and shooting lots of film under chaotic conditions (Spielberg). They remind you that making movies is supposed to be fun, and the enjoyment that goes into a film is reflected on the screen.<p>If you buy this set for the original trilogy, you'll be pleased with the fourth disc. Watch it in one sitting and you can sum up each of the three movies in one word: exciting, dark, and sentimental.

 | product/productId: 6300268993 | review/userId: AEV640MKB3I9J | review/summary: 1/3 GREAT, 2/3 JUST OK | review/text: Much of Superman II was filmed simultaneously with the first movie.  The original plan was to have Superman I end with a cliffhanger: The nuclear missile that Lex Luthor set for Hackensack New Jersey, which Superman diverted into outer space, explodes, shattering the Phantom Zone and setting the three Kryptonian criminals free.  Then the action would freeze-frame, and the screen would flash with &quot;Next Year, Superman II.&quot;<p>Time constraints and studio politics put an end to that scenario.  As the first movie was hastily completed to meet the release date, Superman II was put on hold.  Then, director Richard Donner was fired, and replaced with Richard Lester.  Even though 70% of the second film was complete, much of Donner's footage was reshot by Lester.  In the final film, about one-third of the remaining footage is Donner's.  All scenes with Gene Hackman, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, or E. G. Marshall were shot by Donner.  In addition, the scene at the diner where Clark gets attacked was shot by Donner.  As sequences for Superman II were filmed as much as two years apart from each other, there are glaring continuity problems in the film.  Lester set a different tone than Donner, opting for slapstick humor over the verisimilitude of the first movie.  Also, because of legal difficulties, all footage with Marlon Brando was removed, including a moving scene where Jor-El sacrifices his remaining spirit to return Superman's powers (rather like God touching the hand of Adam).  Anyone who has seen the original script for Superman II knows it would have been a better film if Donner had remained at the helm.<p>So, how is Lester's Superman II?  Pretty impressive overall.  There is ample character development, particularly in the Lois/Clark/Superman love triangle, and plenty of action to keep the viewer satisfied.  The visuals are mostly on the same level as the first movie, although the destruction of the Phantom Zone and the defacing of Mount Rushmore look pretty cheap.  John Williams' excellent score is cannibalized by Ken Thorne, conducting what sounds like a high school orchestra.  So, overall, while entertaining, the movie lacks the epic scope of the first film, and is far less memorable.  <p>The letterboxed DVD looks fine is unspectacular.  The sound is flat and unimpressive.  Warner has packaged the DVD in their usual cheap snapper case.
 | product/productId: 5553604745 | review/userId: A30LMTLC9XVWKJ | review/summary: Great Fun | review/text: Quite simply this is my all time favorite Hitchcock movie and except for the dated style/technique of the action scenes, it could be the best movie ever.<br /><br />Most people associate Hitchcock with suspense but he was also a master of dark comedy. "The 39 Steps" illustrates his ability to blend the two genres into a movie that works well on both levels. If he had turned up the comedy a tiny bit it would be just as hilarious as the best 1930's screwball comedies like "Bringing Up Baby" and "The Awful Truth". Imagine Katherine Hepburn handcuffed to Robert Donat as they wander the Scottish moors. But the chemistry between Madeleine Carroll and Donat is too good to replace her.<br /><br />Hitchcock cast a great ensemble for "The 39 Steps". Lucie Mannheim, Godfrey Teale and John Laurie are outstanding. The supporting cast are all excellent. Yet in the midst of all this it is Peggy Ashcroft who absolutely shines.<br /><br />Donat's misadventures while "on-the-run" from the law are the original "series of unfortunate events". It seems that he just can't go anywhere without being identified and chased. Hitchcock's technique is to lull you into thinking it will be an ordinary scene and then to casually throw something menacing into the scene, so the viewer can never relax. These are like getting a slap in the face before you have a chance to set yourself up for the blow. By comparison with the sinister delicacy and urbane understatement of "The Thirty-nine Steps," modern melodramas are obvious and crude.<br /><br />There are many cool things to watch for:<br /><br />CAMEO-As Donat and Mannheim board a bus early in the film, director Hitchcock makes his customary cameo appearance as a passer-by who tosses litter onto the sidewalk.<br /><br />MATCH CUT-One of the most revolutionary edits in cinema history is in here; after the maid finds Lucie's body her scream dissolves into the hissing of a train whistle.<br /><br />MISE EN SCENE-If you ever wandered what this was ("putting-in-the-scene" is a single shot sequence without cuts to another camera or transition to another scene), Hitchcock's closing shot is probably the all-time best example. As Donat, Carroll, and the police gather backstage around the dying Mr. Memory, on-stage behind them (visible from the wings) and performing for the Palladium audience is a chorus-line of girls high-kicking to the tune of Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle from the film Evergreen (1934). After Mr. Memory confirms the espionage plot, the camera angle changes slightly and Donat and Carroll fill the frame facing away from the camera. Donat still has the handcuffs dangling from his wrist. They spontaneously join hands - this time of their own free will.. The film fades to black.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

 | product/productId: 0792840089 | review/userId: A2BJE5ZFC4JRA8 | review/summary: great but disturbing in somse scenes | review/text: I have children in the performing arts - and I wanted them to to get a taste of the "reality" of a full-time school and the harshness of competition in such schools. The movie was great for that - but some of the R-rated scenes were even hard on me. I do not know if I will watch the movie again soon.  As a presentation of 'what it's like' to enter one of these firecely competitive schools, it was very good; and as a sober revealer of how much anger, disappointment and immorality there is in such a society, it was great. It was a much ROUGHER version of "STEP UP" (the movie).  For parents considering putting their kids into performing arts high schools - it's probably informative, and not too far off.  I would rate it PG-17 to R for language and sexual insinuations.

 | product/productId: 6300216071 | review/userId: A4PLY3W4HNFE0 | review/summary: A Low Budget Classic | review/text: Made in 1967, Targets is Peter Bogdonovich's first and best film, and one of Boris Karloff's most memorable.  It concerns an ordinary, clean-cut young guy who one day decides to take his gun collection atop a tower and shoot people on the freeway-- no explanation given.  The actor who plays the shooter is totally eerie because he's so normal.  The film came about because Karloff owed Roger Corman a couple of days work, so Corman offered to lend him to his talented protege Bogdonovich, who wrote the script and filmed everything in a couple of weeks.  The way he wove Karloff into the story is really nice.  If you love Karloff, this is as significant as his performance as The Grinch Who Stole Christimas the following year.  It's his last really good film.<br /><br />There is a very informative interview with Bogdonovich included and the director does an interesting and funny commentary track.  He is so urbane and world-weary, and it's great to compare him as he is today with who he was then (yes, he also stars with Karloff in the film, though his acting is not the best thing about it).

The original text is used unexpurgated, but with the entire story acted out in full colour.  Anyone thinking of starting to take an interest in the Bible would be very well advised to buy this DVD.  And if you are sufficiently enthralled, there is a similar one based on the book of Acts.

Eating this mess hall food.... that's murder!" | review/text: It's always difficult to determine the amount of time, if any, a child can overcome the loss of their immediate family. Especially a freak accident by way of a speeding motorboat! So far, it is determined that eight years isn't long enough as Angela is forced to accompany her cousin to summer camp. It is then quickly established that her silent demeanor cannot contend with the typical hijinks and hormones of her wild and crazy peers. It is also more than mere karma that contributes to often deadly "accidents" that begin to happen to those who treat Angela the worst (Hurrah! the child molesting head chef of the camp gets it first and promptly, to boot.). Perhaps Camp Arawak should have never reopened in the first place... Even with the, ahem, offsetting twist ending, I'm far from putting this "80s slasher in a campsite" entry in a cult status like others, but there are many worse ones in this horror subgenre. 5.25/10

 | product/productId: 0792844580 | review/userId: A1LQLQUJJZUBTC | review/summary: Ravishing Cinematography & No Need to Apologize | review/text: I've probably watched BLACK NARCISSUS a dozen times, quite a few at special screenings in a theatre, others on TV, VHS & a couple DVDs. I agree with others who wrote that this blu-ray version is best--and I didn't play it on a blu-ray machine. Now that I realize how overly emotional Amazon reviews can be (yes, I've been guilty too), I really didn't plan to reply to what I way overboard 1 star reviews. However, a couple issues were raised that I really feel a need to respond. 1. BLACK NARCISSUS is somehow anti-Catholic and/or anti-nun. 2. The movie is colonialist for not having been filmed on location. 1. The nuns are probably Anglican & I think a fair-minded person would fail to see anything anti-nun or anti-religious. 2. In 1948 hardly ANYBODY filmed on location. This is a British film & Britain was still recovering from a particularly economically devastating World War. If this isn't enough, the idea of location shooting in the Himalayas in 1948 is ludicrous. For one thing, the production company would never have secured the necessary affordable insurance to proceed. The only expression of colonialist idealogy are expressed by the nuns & particularly Sister Ruth who seems to hate everybody. British nuns were as deeply prejudice as their fellow countrymen, naturally they would express these feelings. In fact, the film demonstrate that it's the nuns, not the common folk, who are seriously out of touch with the local reality. That's all I have to say. Other reviewers have appropriately commented on this beautifuil film. I'm adding a few images & I hope people enjoy them & may be motivated to watch BLACK NARCISSUS & judge its merits for themselves.
 | product/productId: 6302148383 | review/userId: A2458BTZT9XY81 | review/summary: A great story and Stewart Granger, too | review/text: Is it just me? I love Technicolor.<br /><br />This film is fabulous. The plot moves quickly, and the fencing scenes are great. I really like Stewart Granger; he brings a credibility and a personality and a sense of fun to his characters that makes them very real. And, Stewart Granger did all his own stunts; that always adds to a film. I have to say, the man looks good in tights, too (not many men do).<br /><br />The famous sword fight is done without any dialogue or background music, which makes it very effective. Modern filmmakers should take note.
 | product/productId: 0783225997 | review/userId: A1POCLWCPYSTGT | review/summary: Underlying theme of film not undermined by script flaws | review/text: The Deer Hunter was a very important film in that it, if nothing else, served as one of the first studies of the effects of the Vietnam war on the average American citizen. While film and television had dealt with the Vietnam conflict to some degree previous to this (John Wayne's The Green Berets [1968] and Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode entitled &quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; [1964] come to mind), serious efforts in depicting the war realistically, as well as the war's effects on its participants, had simply been avoided, presumably for political and social reasons. With the release of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (as well as with &quot;Coming Home&quot;) in 1978, the topic of Vietnam was presented to the public in the form of gritty, realistic productions from major studios. These 2 films certainly must have had an impact on an audience which may not have had a personal, non-distilled understanding of the Vietnam war prior to their release. In fact, graphic scenes such as the Russian Roulette sequence of the Deer Hunter may have (erroneously) informed many on what the everyday GI in Vietnam had to endure at the hands of the VietCong. In this respect, I can understand the distain that reviewers such as Yisrael Harris (&quot;Fantasy Masquerading as Reality&quot;) have for this film. As one of the first dramatic studies of Vietnam ever committed to celluloid, it could be said that the narrative of The Deer Hunter had a responsibility to portray events according to historical truths. This would insure that the structure of the film would faithfully inform a public that may have been getting their first glimpse of war-time atrocities. That being said, I think it is wrong to condemn the film based upon the fact that the historical accuracy of a key sequence is unfounded in the record books. Certainly, the atrocities committed by both sides of the Vietnam conflict were unimaginably cruel (ex: My Lai). When one considers this, is it that far-fetched to ask the viewer to believe that a gang of Vietcong could ruthlessly force US POWs to engage in Russian Roulette for their sick enjoyment and financial gain? I think it is a perfectly legitimate concept and, in the midst of so much war and bloodshed, what makes it inappropriate, other than the fact that it is undocumented? (In a far more legitimate criticism, one could make the argument that the Vietnamese soldiers are unfairly depicted as one-dimensional, innately cruel, soulless dregs). Nothing portrayed in that sequence would be considered 'unfathomable' in the pantheon of war. In Harris's review, he states that &quot;I took it for granted, without even a second thought, that these [Russian Roulette] scenes portrayed a phenomenon that was a legitimate part of the Vietnam War experience&quot;. At no point does the film suggest that this type of activity was a widespread phenomenon within Vietnam. The film treats this as an isolated incident within one remote POW camp. To take for granted that this type of behavior was widespread is simply inappropriate and is not a product of a suggestive script, but rather an uninformed viewer. It is true that the Russian Roulette scene has more than a passing influence on the rest of the film, what with Christopher Walken's character becoming a willing pawn in an underground roulette gambling ring under a drug-influenced stupor. But this is an organized arrangement entered into by two willing parties, not an act of torture, as the previous scene is. Harris goes on in his review to ask &quot;So what is the message of this movie?&quot; and wonders how &quot;to treat seriously a movie which takes such pains to build up a realistic group of characters... when a central pillar of the experience of the movie is total fantasy-land&quot;. Again, I hardly think that Russian Roulette is an unfathomable event within the scope of one of the bloodiest conflicts in US history, and the analogy of suggesting the similarity of a Russian Roulette sequence to a UFO invasion is utterly ridiculous. As they say, all is fair in love and war, and the idea that man's inhumanity to man could not include a cruel game of Russian Roulette is simply naive. The fact that there are no recorded incidents of this happening is irrelevant. This is after all, a fictitious account of ordinary people devastated by war, and in that regard it works on many levels. Besides, if the ultimate goal of the picture is to show the destructive power of war, both physically or emotionally, what difference does it make which vehicle is used to illustrate the destruction?
 | product/productId: 630229357X | review/userId: A2RD3RYAON46C2 | review/summary: Atypical Peanuts flick...not suitable for children? | review/text: Neither my 11-year old son nor I liked this cartoon very much.  After being really excited about watching a Charlie Brown movie together -- he had even taken the time to search it out and DVR it -- he asked if we could stop watching halfway through. It's a long film...or maybe it just seemed long...a seemingly endless parade of sadness, anger, fighting and mistreatment.  A few chuckles were interspersed here and there, but most of all it seemed really heavy.<br /><br />I found myself wondering about Charles Schultz as I watched.  Could it be that he was really a mean & miserable man?  It sure looked like it.  This truly felt like a passive-aggressive revenge piece to me...revenge at some unknown person or circumstance.  Charlie Brown in this movie is an exaggerated case study of woe, unluckiness and helplesness.  He was not even endearingly unlucky as he is in other films.  Snoopy is mistreated and unappreciated, rather than celebrated.<br /><br />Peppermint Patty is the bossy, self-absorbed, female archetype. Charlie Brown's attempts to get away from her are a bit too obvious.  It was clearly a swipe at women.<br /><br />Snoopy falls in the hands of a temporary owner, again a bossy girl who mistreats him, tries to over-control him, and who Snoopy makes snide faces at and does nothing but run away from.  Some of the dialog sounds more like a marital spat than a doggie tale.<br /><br />Lucy is unusually mean and haggard looking in this film, especially during their boxing scene.<br /><br />Linus and Snoopy have a knock-down, drag-out fight over Linus' blanket.  I found myself thinking that Schultz was portraying himself in the characters of Snoopy and Charlie Brown, who were both antagonized and mistreated by everyone else.  Both of them display an unhealthy resignation and passive anger to the people around them.<br /><br />Charlie Brown's speech to Snoopy that "everything you are is because of me" really jumped out like a red hot poker.  I had the same thought as another reviewer; that either Schultz's wife had nagged him with this line, or that he was revealing a core issue of his own marriage.  Sure enough, the other reviewier researched it and discovered that Schultz had divorced the year before this film came out.<br /><br />To me, it was a study in depression, separation, helpessness and meanness -- really nothing redeeming at all.  Even the drawings seemed crude and hard compared to the more soft and pleasing art of later Charlie Brown movies.  Of course, it could be that they just hadn't found their artistic style yet.  But the drawings, music and tone of the movie were much harsher than the more popular Charlie Brown movies.<br /><br />The fighting seemed way too intense and graphic for a children's film, IMO.  I kept wondering what the producers must have thought of it once they saw the finished product.  I guess that once the film was done they had invested so much that they felt there was nothing to do but go ahead and release the film, despite its mean tone and inappropriateness for children.<br /><br />I would recommend that parents pre-view this cartoon to see if they feel it is appropriate and even desirable for their children before watching together.
 | product/productId: 0800107403 | review/userId: A2198O25QYUPXE | review/summary: Medical breakthrough from a fresh and enthusiastic treatment style | review/text: "Awakenings" is a drama film that focuses on catatonic patients with a history of encephalitis lethargica. Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is frustrated by the lack of effort going towards treating the patients, and he explores medicating them with a new drug L-Dopa. The patients make notable improvement and Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) provides wonderful insight into his life with the disease. The movie is inspiring as it confirms that a fresh approach, and an enthusiastic attitude towards treating a disease, can result in breakthroughs, and even if the symptoms only improve temporally, it is a pleasing story that gives hope.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

The sound quality is excellent.<br />The hd presentation of "Amadeus" is very good considering its age, and if that isn't enough to buy this DVD the wealth of supplimentals makes this a no brainer!<br />The disc comes in a digibook with about forty pages of production notes and cast and crew info (unfortunately the hardback cover of my copy was slightly dented in transit).  There is a digital copy compatible with Windows Media Player. I really don't see myself watching a 3 hour film on my zune, but you might. Also included is an hour long documentary on the making of the film, which is quite good.  The extras that I have enjoyed the most are the audio commentary and CD. For $13 this package is a steal!

 | product/productId: 6302484472 | review/userId: ARRDZZJH4RV4F | review/summary: The Domination of the Human Spirit | review/text: In a strictly technical sense this movie is a western,in a much broader and deeper sense it is far more than that.  The central plot line is the heart of the story, not the peripheral characters or the era in time.  This scenerio has been played out countless times throughout human history irregardless of place or time.<br /><br />This is not an allegory regarding politics or anything characteristic of modern times or unique to the harsh realities of the western frontier. It also is not about the title of the central character of the movie.  This is not a movie critic review but the central theme of the domination of the human spirit under the most trying of times that can bring out aspects of men that simply defy description.<br /><br />There simply come rare occaisons in life when the needs or safety of a single man are far outweighed by the needs and welfare of the many.  True heroes are never sterotypical but ordinary men put under extraordinary circumstances and simply respond in any way necessary even within a very real probability that he may not survive the ordeal.  Teddy Roosevelt's speech The Man In The Arena exemplifies this.  This has always been known as arising to the occaison.  I have personally seen and been involved in these types of ordeals that are both wondrous and terrifying.
 | product/productId: 0783241925 | review/userId: A1VBDV4DFCOVO2 | review/summary: straight, but still disturbing | review/text: this movie was straight for the most part since schwarzenegger is so hardcore in about all of his action movies but it was still foul that satan did some of the things that he did. while the best moment was clearly when  schwarzenegger was hanging from that window ledge and satan offered to help  him if he gave over the girl. arnold said &quot;alright&quot; but when  satan reached his arm down far enough to reach, arnold reached up, grabbed  satan's shoulder yelling &quot;f___ you! &quot; and threw satan out onto  the street. it just sounds kinda funny when arnold swears cause of his  accent. but the most disturbing thing was when satan crucified the priest  to the ceiling and carved a message in his chest with a scalpel. nasty. the  only other complaint that i have is that arnold shouldnt've died at the  end. i don't care if it is satan of whoever else. arnold schwarzenegger is  too hardcore to die, especially in action films. the way that end of days  concluded was disappointing. they should've kept the original ending with  arnold blasting satan back to hell with earthly firepower. even though it  wouldnt've made much sense, when exactly to arnold movies actually make  much sense? blowing satan back to hell with firepower would've been much  better and therefore made arnold look much better and maybe the movie  would've been able to stay in theaters for just a little bit longer than it  did. maybe someday we'll get to see the original ending. this movie wasn't  exactly the best thing that arnold's ever done but is an ok installment to  a dynamite career of arnold's. i'd only recommend this to loyal fans of  arnold schwarzenegger. if you can tolerate &quot;junior&quot; and  &quot;jingle all the way&quot; and even &quot;batman and robin&quot; then  you'll probably enjoy this one.

He has watched it a couple of times and adores it, and I thought it was a benign kid's film. My husband and I were suspicious about how they got the animal to perform such tasks but assummed they had trained animals to do it all. Recently, my friend told me that the film was filmed in Japan and as many as 30 cats were killed or harmed in the making. It is all starting to make sense now! I wish I could take it back because I feel awful having given my money to a movie that was cruel to animals.
 | product/productId: 6301758374 | review/userId: A3QZNG1HFPH4G1 | review/summary: Former mental patient doubled over. | review/text: I have to say, having done some time in various institutions, this film was especially funny for me. Was'nt it great how in the 80's big companies of the time were really pushing their products in creative ways through hollywood movies? If I have to look at a product being pushed in my entertainment, then at least put it in a high quality package like this movie, Crazy People.<br /><br />I think you have to be born of this era (40+) to fully appreciate the humor. Companies were just learning how to market themselves well through the media and we were being treated to new tactics in advertising that were very creative and entertaining. This film captures that climate so well.<br /><br />For me though, the hospital setting was just such a bonus, many of the aspects of daily life in the movie for mental patients are actually accurate. I've actually been involved with a character just like Daryl Hannah's nimpho myself while institutionalized! Maybe I should'nt say that so loud?<br /><br />Anyway, I wish this were on DVD as I'm very curious as to what some of the behind the scenes stuff was like. God, what a funny unique film! If you get the chance, buy it, you won't be disappointed.

Here are 5 parts:<p><br />1.  If Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, he could have gotten 3 shots off in time.  Real life snipers have proven it with the gun found in the School Book Depository.<p><br />2.  Jack Ruby didn't place the bullet on the Texas Governor's strecher.  In the movie, he wasn't wearing gloves (check me if I'm wrong).  There would be fingerprints.  No fingerprints were found on the bullet.  <p><br />3.  If there was a &quot;Magic Bullet&quot; it didn't go right, left right, left, etc.  The Texas governor was sitting 3 inches below Kennedy, closer to the door than Kennedy, he was a little wider than Kennedy.  There are a few other differences.  This evens out the bullet.  The bullet has a straight path through both bodies.<p><br />4.  The last speech by Jim Garrison (the long one right before the jury voted) he never said.<br /> <p>5.  There were not 6-8 shots fired.  A police officer accidentally left his recorder running on his motercycle.  It recorded exactly 3 shots, not 6-8 shots. <p>There are a few more flaws in the movie.  I would buy the movie, but if you want facts watch the history channel's view of the Kennedy assassination.
 | product/productId: 076782170X | review/userId: A245AST0T0AZTJ | review/summary: Two Moon Junction | review/text: This movie has a good plot and a good storyline and some good acting (but also some bad).  This southern girl, April, just out of high school, is planning to marry the eligible bachelor, also just out of high school.  But a funny thing happens on the way to the wedding, she takes her younger sisters to a carnival.  Here she encounters the hunky carnival worker who's kind of a cross between James Dean and Tom Berenger, but with long hair.  Sparks fly when he lets himself into her house to take a shower.  Once this line has been crossed the movie explores April's sexual awakening.<br /><br />As said, the acting is pretty good, with the noticable exception of Kristy McNichol.  Her character, a tramp direct from the trailer park, is terrible.  She drives a semi tractor like it's a sports car just to get some liquor.  She talks April out of her top, and then relays how wnderful Mr. Hunk is in bed.<br /><br />The story builds up to the wedding where we think Mr. Hunk finally meets his match in the local Sheriff, but in the end all is well.  April gets married, but allows herself the indulgences of Mr. Hunk's prowess.  She even finds a way into his hotel so she can take a shower.<br /><br />The movie is steamy yet sensual, bold but passionate.  It won't be for everyone, but it has its merits.  If you can find it used somewhere, the cost is probably attractive, so buy it.
 | product/productId: 6301963717 | review/userId: AVMU6G9TYDFFB | review/summary: A homey, circumscribed and excellent little movie | review/text: Miller's Crossing has a fairy-tale quality about it. Within the homey and narrow scope of what it's doing, it succeeds superbly. The character work and cinematography are outstanding, and the music is an integral element, too.<br /><br />The story is circumscribed and without overt interest in seeking to move you very deeply but it is neither distant nor dry or cold, either. On first viewing, it strongly led me to view it a second time to catch the threads and dialogue I knew were there but missed on the first run through.<br /><br />Of all the Coens' work, only "Brother, Where Art Thou" comes close, almost. TIME Magazine's "All Time 100 Best Films" list (drawn up by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss) has Miller's Crossing in its ranks, but nary a Fargo to be found. Certainly the two gents had to negotiate their pick, and it was Miller's Crossing that they chose.<br /><br />My favorite little nugget is when Tom gets roughed up in the warehouse, and I'm certain you can hear the brief sound of whooping and hollering Indians on thundering horseback as he goes unconscious.<br /><br />I absolutely love Miller's Crossing, and I want me' hat, too.

 | product/productId: 630026856X | review/userId: A25MDUJ8ZE5B7W | review/summary: Visually stunning and faithful rendition | review/text: Someone commented that the film was hilarious, and somehow shouldn't be. Guess those people never read the book, or any book by Thomas Mann, who is a great writer of caricature and humour. I personally think Bogarde nailed the part of the german intellectual who "has lived his life like a closed fist". With the exception of the flashbacks and the fact that Aschenbach should have been a writer, the film follows the book closely. I looked forward to seeing some of the comical highlights of the book, like the gypsy band, the annoying old makeup-wearing on the boat and my favourite: the visit to the hairdresser. Films are seldom as good as the books they are based upon, but I think this one is great as a supplement, as the spectacular setting can be difficult to visualize when reading, especially as it belongs to a long gone era.<br /><br />The DVD I wathched had the italian soundtrack.
 | product/productId: 0792840429 | review/userId: AB59T14IBDATR | review/summary: Great Content | review/text: I ordered this DVD for my film & lit class to write an essay on film noir, so my review won't be about the movie itself, but rather the extra features on the disc that I found useful.<br /><br />The DVD has both versions of the movie (pre-release 1945 version and final version released in 1946), which is absolutely vital if you are writing about the film because the two versions are so different and there are many real life factors that affected it.<br /><br />It also included some very helpful extras with a comparison between the two different versions that covers dropped scenes, changed scenes, and changed dialogue (some of this is very subtle, so the fact that it is pointed out and highlighted is great). This comparison also references some personal letters between Warner and Bacall's agent that influenced the changes and briefly covers the reasons why the film was not released until a year after it was finished.<br /><br />The other feature I found interesting was the theatrical trailer. The trailer features Bogart reading a passage from Raymond Chandler's novel which the movie was adapted from, and also mentions the Maltese Falcon (another adaptation in the genre).<br /><br />There is also a very brief history of the filming under "Behind the Scenes", but the information provided was very general and in bad powerpoint-slideshow style and could easily be found online.<br /><br />From a student's point of view, this DVD is a great source and definitely worth it, even if just for the 1945/1946 analysis by Robert Gitts (UCLA). Even if you are not a student, I think this film is worth watching. I chose this film for my essay after reading the plot analysis on [...] because it sounded so interesting, and I was not disappointed (and even giggled during some of the melodramatic action scenes).
 | product/productId: 0769720994 | review/userId: AD4NE02XEFNUZ | review/summary: Handels Theodora | review/text: THis is a truly lovely and moving performance that defeats all expectations<br />Theodora was written by Handel as an oratorio so English music lovers could get to  hear music on a Sunday when protestant God botherers closed the theatres but it is an opera really.<br />Peter Sellars' totally non authentic production sets the action (Romans persecuting early  Christians)  in the near future -  Romans as prison guards in an imaginary Guantanamo Bay type police state America, execution by lethal injection and so on. So the usual distracting concept junk? A moralising piece of Christian  propaganda? Thought for the Day with some half way decent music? A coded tristesse about AIDS or what?<br />No - all my expectations were in the can in no time. This is an intensely moving and convincing performance which brings you face to face with the fact that we are all going to die. That one day the world will not have you in it but will somehow carry on anyway.<br />Upshaw is luminous, beautiful. Daniels does Handel's music proud.<br />If you've never seen an opera before, or never bothered with Handel's operas before, just see it. It will probably change your life. Your current partner had better like opera. If s/he doesn't - change your partner
 | product/productId: 6302253055 | review/userId: A2VJ2SOM7J7AQU | review/summary: Hills is a 70's Horror Classic!!! | review/text: Hills Have Eyes is famed Horror film maker Wes Craven's second film.  He really attepted to make a film more shocking than his film debut Last House on the Left (if that is at all possible).  The film is low-budget and crude in its quality, but it is quite a thrill ride.  The film has a great cast (some of which became big stars like Dee Wallace) and the characters are developed nicely.  Michael Berryman is creepy as hell and as is the case with most 70's Horror classics, the film has an undying ability to shock with scenes of canibalism, rape, murder, mayhem, and even drinking bird's blood.  This is not the best independent horror film of it's era, but if you have an open mind and strong stomach, you'll have fun with this flick!  The Anchor Bay DVD set is a MUST for any fan of the genre.
 | product/productId: 6300214826 | review/userId: A1A87TUBBDPMF0 | review/summary: Coppola's vision of man's heart of darkness.... | review/text: Francis Ford Coppola's original 1979 version of Apocalypse Now is a dark, sardonic, surrealistic yet mesmerizing reworking of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.  Starring Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Fredric Forrest, Larry Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper, Apocalypse Now trades Conrad's African setting for the then-still largely unexplored (by Hollywood, anyway) jungles of Vietnam.<p>The film's premise is deceptively simple.  A hard-bitten, combat-weary Capt. Benjamin Willard (Sheen) is given a difficult (and highly classified) assignment: he is to travel up a long Vietnamese river on a Navy PBR (river patrol boat) to find the jungle outpost of Col. Walter Kurtz (Brando), a highly decorated and intelligent Special Forces officer who has gone "rogue" and utilizing what one senior officer describes as "unsound methods" to fight the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong.  Willard is to locate Kurtz and "terminate (him) with extreme prejudice."<p>In what many viewers of this movie consider the classic centerpiece of  Apocalypse Now, Willard and his uneasy Navy companions need the assistance of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) and his Air Cavalry unit's helicopters to get past a too-shallow part of the river, or else the PBR will run aground. Trouble is, as Kilgore (a "warrior-surfer") points out, "Charlie" controls the mouth of the river.  Still, Kilgore agrees to escort Willard and his PBR for two reasons: he loves a good battle, and the location is ideal for surfing. (When one of his soldiers points out that the place is known as "Charlie's Point," Kilgore barks, "Charlie don't surf!")<p>What follows is perhaps the iconic scene no other Vietnam War movie has been able to top: the early morning helicopter assault on Charlie's Point.  In a terrifying yet oddly exhilarating sequence, we see Kilgore's Huey armada sweeping in on the seaside village with the morning sun behind them and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blaring from their loudspeakers.  It culminates with a devastating air strike on hidden gun positions which have shot down a chopper, prompting Kilgore to utter the hallmark line, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning...it smells like victory."<p>Coppola's film then progressively gets darker and more surreal the farther the PBR makes its way upriver for Willlard's rendezvous with the mystery of Kurtz.  The deeper the motley group goes into the jungle and the more distant they are from the "world," the weirder things get.  And Willard (and the viewer) begins to wonder: what made Kurtz turn his back on the tactics officially endorsed by the Army and the Pentagon?  Why was he being sent to kill Kurtz?  What made the generals and politicians who ran the war any better than Kurtz?<p>Apocalypse Now is famous for having been difficult to make and for being controversial.  When the Pentagon refused to allow Coppola to use its aircraft and equipment, the Oscar-winning (The Godfather Parts I and II) director turned to the Philippine Army, which lent its Hueys and other "toys" to the production.  It's also well known that Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming.<p>What is somewhat not widely known is that Apocalypse Now was once a project George Lucas was heavily involved in.  As one of Coppola's co-founders of American Zoetrope,  Lucas and Coppola's collaborator John (Red Dawn) Milius came up with many of the ideas incorporated into the final film.  According to Dale Pollock's 1983 biography "Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas," the concept of the journey to Kurtz via a boat was Lucas'.  Lucas had also wanted badly to direct Apocalypse Now, but when the production schedule dragged on and planning for Star Wars got underway, Coppola refused to wait till the science fiction film was finished to begin production of Apocalypse Now.  He had set a release date for 1976, the Bicentennial year, and if Lucas went off to direct Star Wars, that date would be set back by a year. He refused to budge, and Lucas went his separate way.  As it turned out, production problems, including a typhoon and Sheen's illness, slowed down production anyway and the film was released in 1979.  (If you look closely, though, you'll see a visual homage to Coppola's friend and protege: the intelligence officer played by Harrison Ford wears a name tag with the name Lucas on his fatigues jacket.)<p>The original Paramount Widescreen Collection DVD (not to be confused with the more recent Apocalypse Now Redux) is a barebones offering.  Its single disc only has English subtitles, English and French audio tracks, the original theatrical trailer, a scene called "Destruction of Kurtz Compound" which has the only bit of director's commentary by Coppola, and excerpts from the original theatrical program.
 | product/productId: 0792840798 | review/userId: A492LK506AL1G | review/summary: one of my favorite movies | review/text: Talk about George Cukor in his dotage or Bergen with an impossibly bad Southern accent but this is one beautiful film, Matt Lattanzi, Mr Olivia Newton John and father of Chloe, has a butt shot he could never live down, in fact, he even went "off the grid" recently. Jackie Bisset shines as a cynical gorgeous jealous writer who can't quite top the mouth of the south, Bergen, although she could have had her husband several times. i think it's a hoot with every cliche in the book but what fun, even thirty one years later, it still holds up as well as its stars do.
 | product/productId: 0792842499 | review/userId: A192KEPM0HW6AC | review/summary: Brilliant Restoration! | review/text: &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; is Sergio Leone's magnum opus. An audacious undertaking, it would have flopped miserably in any other director's hands. Only someone so commited to his artistic vision as Leone could have pulled off this bombastic pageantry of human nature in all its facets, its capacity for cynicism, greed, bloodlust, revenge, heroism, redemption and honour.<p>This movie must be *experienced.* Put the DVD in, turn the stereo all the way up and let it pummel you from the moment the Lardani titles blast onto the screen in a blaze of Technicolor fury. The montage of colour, interspersed by stark black and white visages of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach is a tough act to follow, like Saul Bass' mesmerising titles for Hitchcock's &quot;Vertigo.&quot;<p>The wait is now over! Last year, MGM/UA issued a restored 35mm print, which showed at the Film Forum in Manhattan. First restored in Italian by Cineteca Nazionale, the English-language restoration was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese, whose efforts with the Film Preservation Foundation have helped fund preservation of America's celluloid heritage. Both Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood returned to the sound studio to dub new dialogue for approximately 20 minutes of restored footage. Both sound a little older and scratchier, but these added scenes help to explain both Tuco's and Angel Eyes' gangs and some plot points that were previously unclear. However, they both sound great! (Van Cleef's voice was dubbed by a professional voiceover artist, and sounds almost on target). The movie now has the true feel of a sprawling epic, one that's earned its right to take its time.<p>This special edition DVD features the movie restored to its original length in the Italian version, and comes jam packed with interviews with Eastwood, Wallach, producer Alberto Grimaldi and -- most importantly -- Mickey Knox, who wrote the English language dialogue. Knox crafted lines that lived up to the larger than life screenplay. You'd swear the original was in English, the dialogue is so perfectly tailored!<p>But the vision is singularly Leone's. It starts slowly, as  a band of bounty killers home in on their prey, small-time bandit Tuco Ramirez (THE UGLY, played by the venerable Eli Wallach). They pile through a saloon door, then the camera imediately pans away laterally. Suddenly, his body hurtling through the front window in a rain of glass, Tuco bursts onto the street -- in what has to be the most absurd grand entrance in screen history -- revolver in one hand, a chicken leg in the other. It's total chutzpah on Leone's and Wallach's part.<p>If you think *that* can't be topped, watch Wallach's entire performance. Animated is putting it mildly. More than a performance, Wallach is a one-man band, nay, Army. Never has such a selfish, petty, ratty and shifty little man been played so larger than life. Wallach smirks, scurries, grimaces, chuckles, shouts, bellows and slyly oils his way across the screen in what has got to be the hammiest performance ever by a method actor. Or *any* actor: He makes Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Charles Laughton look like the grey and sullen cast of Woody Allen's &quot;Interiors,&quot; he's so alive with passion that he literally sweats his performance out through the filthy pores on his stubble-ridden face. And he's wonderful!<p>If that's a tough act to follow, you haven't met the bad. They don't come any badder than Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef's hired killer who's got ice water running through his veins. Van Cleef is ruthless, bold and heartless. Riding out of nowhere onto a doomed man's rancho, Angel Eyes pays a visit, carrying out a murder for hire. The price: $500. But the victim offers him $1000 to look the other way. No dice: Angel Eyes isn't in it for the money. Rather, he's a man who loves his work, and always sees the job through. So, the poor sod dies anyway.<p>Clint Eastwood is as cool as a cucumber as The Man With No Name (but really one with sort of a name, in this case &quot;Blondie,&quot; which is Wallach's moniker for him). It's fun watching the ongoing relationship between Blondie and Tuco as bounty hunter and prey. In another life, they would have been great pals, but in this life (&quot;we're all alone in this world,&quot; Tuco confesses to Blondie, half seriously, half cynically) their love of money is thicker than friendship. So, they invent ingenious and cruel ways to exact revenge of each other.<p>It's during one of Tuco's sadistic plots - in which he marches the pale-skinned Eastwood across 100 miles of scorching desert - that the plot finally comes to a head: A driverless stagecoach full of wounded Confederates happens across their path, and through a twist of fate, Tuco and Blondie each have two halves of a secret which, if put together, will make them a quarter of a million dollars richer. But, without each other the two halves are worthless. Thus does Tuco do a 180 from brutal executioner to Blondie's would-be saviour. Now that he could be rich, he suddenly realizes how valuable their friendship is.<p>It's not before long that they wind up with Angel Eyes, as they're captured by Union soldiers. At the prisoner of war camp, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Van Cleef is now more restrained and less thuggish as he deals with Tuco to extract the secret; his henchman Wallace (Mario Brega, a Leone stalwart), pummels it out of Tuco.<p>In epic fashion, after a shootout in a deserted town and a bridge demolition that explodes across the screen, Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes make their way to the cemetery where the treasure is buried. In a fanfare of brass, percussion and chorus, the three face each other down in the cemetery plaza. It's a gorgeous and cathartic set piece. Credit must go not only to composer Ennio Morricone but also to musical director Bruno Nicolai, who conducts the score con fuoco.

 | product/productId: 6301514025 | review/userId: A1QAULZ03WCAEO | review/summary: should have gotten the other version | review/text: My mother remembered this as being a good movie. After we both watched it - her for the second time, me for the first time - I had to ask her if it wasn't Flowers for Algernon she remembered. She was disappointed seeing it again, and I was not impressed either. I started losing interest when Charly began ogling his teacher, and they lost me entirely when he assaulted her. Why'd they have to put that whole bit in? I mean, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that a mentally retarded person would still be fully developed physically. I think that whole sex craze was added just for the sensational effect, a reflection of the time in which it was made. I watched this version instead of Flowers for Algernon because I didn't want to see something too kidified, but now I'm sorry I got this one instead. If you want to see a better movie than this, but along the same lines, I highly recommend The Yarn Princess, if you can get hold of it. Unlike Charly, who really has no motive to "become smart" other than for its own sake, Margaret must "become smart" or else she will lose her children. Trust me, it's way better than this one.
 | product/productId: 5555670451 | review/userId: A39CX0EE4BZCZC | review/summary: Shane Leaves Powerful Memories | review/text: This was the first film I remember seeing in the theater so it has some sentimental value. Now on DVD seeing it decades later, it certainly doesn't have the impact it did back then, but it will always be considered by me and many others as one of the great classics in film history.<br /><br />These classics, particularly the westerns, were good vehicles in promoting values and definite good vs. evil stories. The evil here is personified by Jack Palance. He doesn't have many lines but he doesn't need them. His body language in this film spoke volumes, and he was one scary dude.  However, an unsung role (eighth billing in the credits) in here was the one by Emile Meyer, who played the real villain in this story, "Ryker." (Palance was just called in at the end.) A young Ben Johnson plays a member of his Ryker's gang.<br /><br />Alan Ladd, meanwhile, is the hero, the man who comes to the aid of family man Van Helflin, his wife Jean Arthur and young son Brandon De Wilde. The kid, De Wilde, steals the film and made himself into a young star with his role here. Whether feverishly chewing on his candy while witnessing Ladd fighting the bad guys or his plaintiff cries for "Shane!" at the end of the film, he made a memorable impression.<br /><br />The only overdone part - as seen in so many old-time westerns - is the amount of punches people took, blow after blow, when in real life they would have knocked unconscious right off the bat! But, that's part of the genre, I guess.<br /><br />"Shane" was a forerunner of many of western that copied its successful formula. This movie was so famous that a lot of newborns were named "Shane" for awhile.<br /><br />"Powerful" is another adjective that describes this film - back then and still now. This story will get your blood pumping!

 | product/productId: 0783243456 | review/userId: A2M66S05KKNSWC | review/summary: What's the Point? | review/text: This is a shot-for-shot, almost verbatim, remake of Hitchcock's masterpiece. It's good filmmaking, but I can't help wondering &quot;why bother?&quot; Yes, it's a good film, and if it were the only Psycho out there, it would doubtless have been well received, but since it does not improve on Hitchcock's original, it seems more of an exercise by a film studies MFA student, than a serious attempt at commercial filmmaking.<br /><br /> &quot;But it's in color!&quot; Well, yes, so? Modern viewers may overlook the fact that Hitchcock made Psycho in 1960, a time when most films were in color, and Hitchcock himself had already made a number of color films. He did not shoot Psycho in black-and-white because he had no choice. He shot it in black-and-white because he was a great filmmaker, who understood that this particular story would play better in stark contrasts, rather than the nuances of color. If you pay attention, it is quite obvious that the actual colors of the sets and costumes actually were black and white. If color stock had been used, there still would be little color in the film. This movie is a horror film, but it is also a statement about people in dead-end lives. Black-and-white footage superbly highlights this theme.<br /><br /> Anne Heche, in Janet Leigh's old role is quite passable, but sadly does not use peculiarities of plot to communicate her character. For example, when Janet Leigh's Marion<br /><br /> Crane in 1960 meets her lover in a hotel during her lunch hour, it is par for the era. However, Anne Heche leaves us wondering why on earth, if Sam is divorced, her 1998 affair is such a secret that she has to sneak off to sleep with Sam on third-party territory. There is opportunity for Marion to show the kind of quirkiness that Heche seems to have no problem showing in her real life. I imagine she was constrained by director Gus VanSant's obsession with recreating the original film. Vince Vaughn, as Norman, is so slavishly trying to be Anthony Perkins, that he seems to forget he is actually playing Norman Bates. As a result, he's more annoying than creepy.<br /><br /> However, there's no reason not to see this film; there's nothing really bad about it other than wasted opportunities. And die-hard fans of Hitchcock will probably be driven by curiosity to see it anyway. It's worth a few dollars as a video rental, or as a used film from Amazon, even if it's not a major film accomplishment, as the first version was.

What a great concept, to do a wedding movie from the father's perspective.  Spencer is the head of the household, or so he thinks, who gets steamrolled into giving his most beloved daughter, Kaye (Elizabeth Taylor) a wedding bigger than anything he could have ever even dreamed (or nightmared) of!<p>Spencer narrates the story, starting from a scene of frightening carnage, at his home after his daughter's wedding reception. From his daughter's annoyingly coy announcement of her impending marriage to Buckley Dunston, yup, that's right, Buckley, to the wedding rehersal, Spencer hardly knows which end is up. <p>This movie, although in black and white and made ages ago, still rings true.  While buckets upon buckets of movies show the mother daughter relationship, this movie shows the ties that bind a father and  daughter, and the difficulty and emotion that ensues when that relationship changes forever.<p>This movie is funny, touching and very sweet. So if you're an old, crusty cynic, this is not your cup of tea!

Alex reluctantly accepts the situation as she can't afford to live off campus.  A curious scenario develops:  Alex has eyes for Eddie, who's studious and bookish and might be gay, sexually brash and obnoxious Stuart likes the demure Alex (who can't stand him) and Eddie realizes he's attracted to Stuart.  The unlikely trio explores themselves and their sexuality with an &quot;us against them&quot; attitude, or as Eddie puts it:  &quot;Those who get the joke, and those who don't&quot;.

The first half of the movie was great, but I agree with other reviews that a cut away from the island between &quot;I have made fire&quot; and the next section of the movie would have helped the pacing a bit, and the cut wouldn't have been as abrupt.<p>As for the ending.... ah, what can I say.  This will likely go down in history as being among the worst endings in the history of film, and takes the movie down to the 2 star rating.  I can understand the reasoning behind the ending, which is basically to let the audience draw their own conclusion, but we don't need to be beat on the head with a metaphor to get it.  In addition, based on Tom Hank's performance, the audience gets attached to his character, and likely wants to see some closure... and without giving away too much more of an entertaining but disappointing movie, the end of the movie left most everyone I've talked to about it with a big cartoon question-mark above their heads.<p>Bottom line, entertaining, but rent or borrow it, don't bother buying.  It's not a movie you're likely to want to watch more than once.

 | product/productId: 0767845722 | review/userId: A3R2M6DGECQOO | review/summary: When an Angry God Screams In Your Ear | review/text: Milla Jovovich is astonishingly good in her performance as Joan of Arc. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  Cinematography, sets, costumes are all perfection. Mystical sequences are suitably bewildering...are they from the mouth of God or madness? The seemingly endless battle scenes, the thick dark brutality of 15th century warfare, the ruthless machinations of power and betrayal are filmed mercilessly to great effect. The blunt, relentless savagery bludgeons us as we are plunged ferociously into the fray, urged on by a frenzied, schrieking berserker with an angel's face. Regardless of whether you prefer to see Joan's story as myth or history or a combination of the two, this film is a powerful depiction of the mayhem and miracles of martyrdom that can occur when an individual's voice of conscience and reason are lost in the blast of an angry god's screams of retribution. Whether manufactured by religion, manipulated by the state, morphed from some secret personal madness, "holy war" has never been the work of the Creative and Loving Spirit that moves the Universe. Suffering and the horrors of war come from people. I didn't see this film when it was in the theatres, but saw it on VHS three years later.  It stikes me that the people behind the 9/11 tragedy, the people who clamored for the death penalty the moment the D.C. snipers were caught, the kamikaze pilots of World War II, and all those down through history who call upon death with a righteous voice have a little of Joan of Arc within them. Who spoke to Joan...the God or the Satan of her religion? Or were the voices from the deep well of her own psyche twisted and turned about by the times in which she lived? Can it be that Bin Laden and Joan of Arc are cut from the same cloth? When will it end? When will it ever end? This movie asks powerful questions that need asking today more than ever.
 | product/productId: 0790715112 | review/userId: A2GCHG6U8HTVIT | review/summary: A First-Rate Movie That Just Happens To Be A Western | review/text: Unforgiven is a strong, bleak movie. It's also a credit to Clint Eastwood's self confidence as a producer/director and ability as an actor that he cast Gene Hackman in such a showy role and then was able to stand up to Hackman's performance. For me, it was those two heavy-weight performances, balancing each other, that gave the movie its energy.<br /><br />However, like so many movies today, it is lo-o-ong. I think it could have lost 20 minutes and been an even better movie, just by trimming a minute or two, or more, from almost every scene.<br /><br />I'm not sure how vital the Morgan Freeman role is to the movie, other than providing a kind of weary humanity. He provides the excuse for Eastwood to throw off the skin of good citizen that his wife made him wear and become the killer he always was, but I think almost anything could have been used to do that. Without Freeman, I could see Little Bill bringing the madam and the scar-faced prostitute to the bar to once and for all find out where Eastwood and the kid are. They are secretly followed by one of the other prostitutes. Little Bill hits them a few times while his pals watch, then the madam loses her temper and refuses to be intimidated anymore by Little Bill's bullying. She attacks him verbally and accuses him in front of the others of being impotent whenever he has sneaked into the whorehouse. This enrages Little Bill. He grabs his whip and beats them to death in a pscho-sexual rage. The more he beats them the more he sweats and gets red in the face. It obvious he's having a sexual release while he's hitting them. Even his pals are uneasy and finally pull him away. The prostitute who had been secretly watching is horrified and scared to death. She knows where Eastwood is and goes to find him. Eastwood had sympathy for the madam and the other prostitute; he saw them as life's losers just as he was. And he decides to hell with trying to play by the rules. He mounts up and heads for the show down.<br /><br />I'm only half joking. Some sort of sexual inadequacy would help explain Little Bill's character and his need to be the alpha male. I can't remember if there was any explanation for Little Bill's behavior other than that he was just a bad guy.<br /><br />I think Unforgiven deserved the acclaim it received, and certainly Eastwood did.

Tim Holt as a gloriously understated &quot;everyman&quot;, that you can't HELP but hope that HE ends up doing alright at the end.  HUMPHREY BOGART as a man who, because of his greed, gradually descends into insanity.  Barton MacLane as the rotton scoundrel who tries to cheat Bogie and Holt out of their money that he owes them.  Robert Blake as the cute little kid that sells the tickets.  John Huston, as the man who Bogie puts &quot;the bite&quot; on, more than once.  Bruce Bennett as a man who is fortune hunting, but for a good reason, to support his wife. Alfonso Bedoya as a cold-blooded bandito.  A well written story about a very understandable thing...greed.  We all have it to a certain point, but it is how we handle it that helps define us.  See what I mean?  There are many things to like about this movie.<p>Bogie most CERTAINLY deserved to WIN an Academy Award for his performance in this film.  Dobbs' descent into madness (as portrayed by Bogie) was so GRADUAL, that you barely even noticed it until he started talking to himself, but you were sure of it when he pointed his finger in Tim Holt's face and yelled &quot;I know you for what you are!&quot;<p>I think all THREE of the major stars of this movie, Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Walter Huston (he DID get one) should have gotten Oscars.  Bogie was great, Huston won the award, but without Holt to tie the whole thing together, it would not have been as poignant, I think.<p>WATCH IT!  You may not LOVE it, but you will definitely love many things about it.<p>Oh yes, let's not forget &quot;Badges?! We don't need no badges!  We don't have to show you no stinkin' badges!!!!&quot;, the famous line spoken by Bedoya.

 | product/productId: 0792846303 | review/userId: AP9TSAQICVEVT | review/summary: Horror should be scary, so........ | review/text: There is a fog outside my window as i am typing this :)<br /><br />The Fog was a film i first viewed as a child, it absolutely terrified me, the idea of mist carrying something deadly is in itself a terrifying idea, then there is the fact that when our vision is curtailed we panic (eg as in sudden darkness).<br /><br />In this film an ancient curse catches up with the residents of a sleepy seaside town, long dead sailors arise as spectres inhabiting a creepy almost sentient fog which sweeps inland at a supernatural rate. As the fog moves in, one woman trapped in a lighthouse sounds out a warning, "stay away from the fog there is something in the fog". Carpenter is really good at building scary or paranoid atmosphere as he proved in 'The Thing' and 'They Live', the fog builds up an excellent atmosphere of dread throughout. Horrors must have atmosphere or they become silly creature features which more closely resemble dark comedies, The Fog has atmosphere and good acting performances in spades. The fog is a good horror, made in a mould which they have forgotten how to use nowadays.<br /><br />My advice is to go towards The Fog, get into The Fog.

But since the last review was done in 2005, and I just suffered through this film last night, I thought it was important to get a one star review on top of the review stack so that it is the first thing anyone considering this movie sees.<br /><br />The positive, and unexpected, side of having seen this movie is that I had not anticipated that the review forum would be such a treasure trove of abstract nonsense. There are some real howlers in here, as well really classy vocab words and pseudo-intellectual phrases that work great at art gallery receptions or mixed together will get you at least a B an art history exam: "milieu", "intoxicating green", "argumentative fallacy (which apparently "precipitates"), "ad-hominem fallacy", "the immanence(sic) of meaning", "meaning's retreat", "effecting", "sullied with numerous derogatory connotations by the vox populi (later described as "callow reviewers)", "enconium" "[the] gnarled tongues of pamphleteering zealots [!]", "verdurous", "unperturbed", "meaning-indifferent configurations"...throw some of those around and people will really think you've this meaning of life thing solved!

This fast-moving action film still keeps me on the edge of my seat. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones could not be better as adversaries in Ford's dogged search for proof of his innocence in the murder of his wife. You can count on a tightly wound, well-told story, with many great twists and turns, plus the element of surprise that maintains a high suspense factor till the final credits.<br /><br />OK, there is a great train wreck scene. But if you are expecting a lot in the way of special effects, shoot-em-up blood and gore, bad acting and a mindless plot, this is not the movie for you. Everyone else: grab the popcorn and enjoy this film.
 | product/productId: 1404974601 | review/userId: A3H9JSM1SUTE4O | review/summary: GOOD ACTION BUT NOTHING NEW | review/text: Rob Cohen's thrilling, literally hi-octane, mostly airborne adventure STEALTH (Sony) was another summer box office disappointment.  But this one deserves discovery on DVD for widescreenn action fans, even though it's pretty much by the numbers.<br /><br />Set in the very near future, a navy fighter jet with a computer pilot develops a mind of its own during practice maneuvers.  Human pilots, who at first seem less intelligent and armed, are sent up to stop the AI jet from starting a nuclear global war.<br /><br />Stupendous, thrilling, ultra photo-realistic action never lets up.  And the viewer is whipped around at supersonic speeds in an ultimate thrill ride. This one is much better than I imagined and the four plus hours of highly watchable extras are as good as the feature.  Especially memorable is the intelligent, creative, almost spiritual portrait of director Rob Cohen.

This is a true classic and will endure through the ages. It is a highly entertaining film with great action, romance, and adventure. It was a time of true nobility - when honour and respect meant everything to a person, even if it meant sacrificing one's true love. The quality of the DVD is excellent. The superb, moving performances of both Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren will leave a lasting impression on you. You will not regret including this great movie in your DVD collection.
 | product/productId: 0790736322 | review/userId: A1SVXJZ3386U2D | review/summary: Macabre | review/text: I read the book right after it came out and I couldn't put it down!  When the movie came out I already heard a lot of the advance publicity but I was still deeply engrossed when I watched it for the first time.  I have seen it many times since although not in its' recent remastered version.  It is a movie that will challenge you in many ways yet it is also a movie that has the potential to reassure you are well.  It is a very well-made movie complete with great writing, acting, directing, and, above all, great special effects.  Even after all of these years, they still are impressive.  <p>This movie is not for the squeemish as I can illustrate with an experience I had in Ensenada, Mexico.  The movie had been out for a year or two and a friend of mine and I were traveling in Baja Mexico.  There wasn't a lot to do at night so, when I saw that the movie was playing at the local theatre, I suggested we go see it.  When my friend said he hadn't seen it before, I insisted that we go.  The theatre was fairly full when we went in.  As the movie got progressively more intense, the show would stop and a warning notice would appear on the screen advising the viewers that the movie was going to become even more graphic.  This screen appeared three times during the movie.  At the end of the show, the lights came on and I was surprized to discover that there were only a handful of people besides my friend and I who had sat through the whole movie.  <p>I don't know that the movie will grip you quite so hard but it may.  There is a strong element of hardcore Christian good versus demonic evil and you can get caught up in this.  The actual history of exorcism is fairly scant given the number of years the scarement has been around and the hundreds of millions of Christians that were or are in this world.  I suspect most people would view this movie more as a test of their nerves rather than their faith.  However, after my experience in Mexico, I thought I should at least put my own warning notice on the screen.

 | product/productId: 0790729725 | review/userId: A3UQZ3ROXACUB4 | review/summary: Great film, but buy the special edition instead | review/text: I needed to watch this for a film class, so I just bought the cheapest version amazon had.  In hindsight, I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent DVD.  This is a double-sided DVD, with the movie split in half over both sides.  This means that if you're watching it in your living room, you'll have to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the movie.  In addition, it is not anamorphic widescreen, so on a widescreen tv it shows up as a little box in the center of the screen (though on a fullscreen it should be fine).  Finally, it has no special features except for the trailers.  If you plan on watching this film more than once, invest the extra bucks and get the newer edition.
 | product/productId: 6300213919 | review/userId: AUF6FDVDLET0W | review/summary: Hilarious and Campy! I Love this movie!!!! | review/text: Ok, I know MOMMIE DEAREST was supposed to be a serious movie about how Joan Crawford abused her kids, and must praise Christina Crawford for being a pioneer at pushing forward the movement of child abuse awareness and adopted children's rights with her book, but......THIS MOVIE IS HYSTERICAL!!!!<br /><br />Faye Dunaway plays Mrs. Crawford so over the top, it's funny and fantastic all at the same time!!! and she really resembles her in the movie!!--the eyebrows and the thick,lipstick mouth are funny and freaky at the same time! This movie has so many funny and outragious one-liners it's crazy!!!! Mommie Dearest was a true diva-and a whack job!  Though she was a great movie actress in such classics as Mildred Pierce and What Ever Happened TO Baby Jane, this woman NEVER should have been near kids with her drinking, tantrums and sexual conquests...And, mind you, this was in the late 1940's-early 1950's!!!<br /><br />This movie, to me, is as campy as ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW..You can't help, if you've watched it many times, yell out the one liners and hysterical dialog during Mrs. Crawford's "Dramatic" diemmas she delt with as "Hollywood Royalty"<br /><br />Here's a list of some funny lines=sometimes, it's not even the dialog, but the way Faye Dunaway delivers them:<br /><br />"No Wire Hangers ever!"<br /><br />"Is this an institution of learning, or a teenage Brothel"<br /><br />"You think your Life's a mystery!"<br /><br />"dammit, Parino's is my place!"<br /><br />"I may as well have MGM tattooed on my backside!"<br /><br />"why must everything be a contest!?"<br /><br />"I'd rather you go to school bald than looking like a tramp!"<br /><br />"if you polish the floor, you must move the tree!"<br /><br />"Tina!!!!Bring me the axe!"<br /><br />"Box office Poison!!"<br /><br />"Figures you'd know where to find the boys, and the booze!"<br /><br />"Why can't you give me the respect, that i am entitled to!!"<br /><br />=these are just a dozen of the many hysterical lines used in this movie=obviously, Mrs.Crawford always acted as if a camera was on her 24-7!!! I can Imagine what it may have been like if she did a reality show like the Osbournes!!Pure Hysteria!<br /><br />This movie is a must to watch and own by any "diva" out there=it is so sinful to laugh at it, but you just can't help it!! If you have a dark sense a humor and can pick up on over the top acting, you'll get what i'm saying about this film...IF I could, i'd give it ten stars!!!!!

Even though Sergent York believed in God and peace and saw the wrongness in taking another person's life, he came to see a bigger picture and that is that not everybody holds to that same belief, infact the the very things that we believe in and hold dear, the right and wrong as we know it can become threatened. What are we going to do about it?<br />This is the very heart of the movie, it is about putting aside our personal veiws to see a bigger picture, it is about not just giving verbal support, but about putting your life on the line of what you believe and understand, it is about standing up for what is right. It can cost, but it can also come with unexpected rewards. The fact that it is taken of a true story adds greatly to the richness and depth of the story.<br />The documentry side of this dvd package, adds to the veiwing of the movie and the story behind the movie. Overal the whole package is well put together and well worth watching.

The back clearly states "in fullscreen", so we can't claim we were "duped". Plus, I checked my old separate collections of each film, and they were also in fullscreen--nothing ventured, nothing gained!<br /><br />Just kick back and enjoy the work of 2 masterful actors who have since left us; the lovely/saucy presence of Ann-Margret (and later, Sophia Loren); plus, the scene-stealing "dirty old man" Burgess Meredith.<br /><br />However, it would've been nice to have a "making of.." featurette or cast & crew interviews.

 | product/productId: 6301977742 | review/userId: A7Y6AVS576M03 | review/summary: Powerful Performances ask Deep Questions | review/text: This film touches on the nerve of what science fiction is all about. Man through his evolution, his experimentations, his encountering of the unknown always must confront what he has wrought. I was always impressed by Edward G. Robinson's performance in this film. It raised the meaning of realism in acting to a new height. His death scene was very moving to me and seems ever more prophetic as the days go by. I saw this film again recently and was also impressed by Charlton Heston's performance. Years ago after making "55 Days at Peking," "Planet of the Apes" and "Number One" I thought that Charlton Heston had given up on acting. I don't mean that he quit the profession but I felt that he started taking roles that were undemanding and beneath his talent. I thought he had sold out, his performance in this film being a prime example. However, I now see how wrong I was. At the time it just seemed too incredible that someone could be moved by the mere scent of a bar of soap. Such a small pleasure. However, I now see that Charlton Heston played these scenes brilliantly. The performances in this film have since transcended the shock ending of what the Soylent Green food supplement was really made of. What has come to the very nature of man in the future world of overpopulation and starvation? What has he reverted to? The powerful performances mirror these profound questions and that is the force behind this unpretentious film.

I fully expected to MST3K this movie to death, and oh boy, did I ever.  The VHS version has the producer/director/some dude behind the scenes, come out in a leather jacket, spiked hair and the worst "i'm a bad guy fear me" tone in the history of cinema and deliver the entire plot in 1 minute, before the actual "feature" begins.  The plot, the acting, the sets, the characters... it's all toilet tissue.  The single greatest special effect was the 4 seconds of nudity provided by the "little girl" (who looked like a 20something stripper with amazing fake boobs, Lizzie Borden? yeah..right) Not to mention this cross-dressing troglodyte who through 9 pounds of make-up, hair, and nail extensions was unable to pull off 12 lines of dialogue (as the MOM character no less!) in anything resembling a high range voice.  Indeed, the gales of laughter my friend and I received when "she" attempted to 'scream' and at the conclusion of the movie, and "her" voice was lower than "DAD's".... reminded me of Herman Munster in drag.... sad.  (Eddie Izzard you aren't...)<br />I can go on and on about this train wreck, I am still trying to figure out how the heck this junk made it to the shelf of my local video store......

When I rented this movie, knowing that Wilde was homosexual, I expected there to be some homoerotic moments. However, I didn't expect these scenes to emerge quite so quickly, and last nearly the  entire course of the film.  I did enjoy the film--Fry and Law were  amazingly like the characters they portrayed--but I was kind of surprised  at how much of the film focused on Wilde's sexual side.  I suppose I was  thinking that the movie would have been more about his works than about his  sexuality.  It was educational, though, and provided an interesting glimpse  into Victorian England's society and expectations.

Finally, I came to the conclusion that Rob Zombie made this film as a joke so that when people saw it and said that he had no business in Hollywood, he could surprise them with a better film on his next try... then I saw the Devil's Rejects and I'm just left scratching my head. What were any of these people thinking?

 | product/productId: 6302280710 | review/userId: ANSHLN1NO1X43 | review/summary: I directed this movie. Here's my commentary. | review/text: I directed this movie in 1990, so it was difficult to not give it five stars, which it should get just for the fact that it's a fairly big production on a small budget. And since the movie doesn't have a commentary track, I'll mention a few things about the production here.<br /><br />The producer Ron Marchini is one of the very first low budget independent producers working outside Hollywood. I directed his first production "Death Machines" in 1975, filmed in Stockton California where we were to film "Omega Cop".<br /><br />Ron had the production idea, of hiring the name actors Adam "Batman" West, Troy Donahue, and Stuart Whitman before I joined the project. He also had the story of a policeman that survives a solar flare that devastates the earth.<br /><br />My contribution was to schedule the production for a 21 day straight shoot using the star names so they appear through out the story, even though we had them for only a limited time. Marchini, who was one of the best karate competitors in the '70s, played the lead. He had a string of martial arts movies produced in the Philippines that he had starred before starting his own company in America.<br /><br />Working with him on the script, I changed the single female lead to three females that he meets up with through out the story, hopefully to re-fresh the story with each new introduction of a pretty face. Each girl had a unique look and personality, to keep things lively.<br /><br />Working on a 21 day shoot, I was responsible for getting 4.2 minutes of movie story a day, as the movie had to be 90 minutes. My big contribution to the movie was adding a "Wild Bunch" shoot out at the beginning of the story, before the solar flare happened. Marchini would have 3 cop buddies with him, and they would be killed in a raid on a gangster slave auction. At the end of that scene the solar flare would happen. He would then be forbidden to re-enter the police strong hold run by Adam West.<br /><br />Marchini was hesitant about okaying such an ambitious scene of the four cops having a shoot out with 20 gangsters, while 30 slave market customers are running for cover. It would require a special effects man, for blood and bullet hits, as well as to blow up a car. All this to be done in two days with a film ratio of 5 to 1.<br /><br />We would be shooting with 3 cameras, one often in slow motion (which burns up a lot of film at high speed), plus paying a stunt man to do a spectacular back fall from the roof of a building to a car top. I always remember Marchini looking at me once the shot was done and the stunt man was okay, "I'm glad that's over with." He was very worried about out stunt man, and the safety of all on the film. I was as well, and in fact nobody got hurt. And then thinking about all the film use to get the slow motion effect he laughed and said, "Man, I heard that camera buzzing at high speed and thought 'there goes all our film.'"<br /><br />I have to say, that once Marchin okayed that big scene he worked hard both as a producer and actor to get it done. I had the confidence to complete it in the two days. I knew how to get a scene in the can before the sun goes down. The challenge was to get as much action that was possilbe before the sun went down on that second day.<br /><br />To make up for the large amount of film used on that scene, I had to shoot other scenes almost at a one to one film ratio. The "Wild Bunch" shoot out is the highlight of the film, but we had to make sure the ending was equally spectacular, so we had Marchini as the Omega Cop running from a building that he had set bombs to, exploding just a few feet behind him and gaining on him. Real fire balls were set off by a special effects man as Marchini ran past them. Filming with three cameras, I held my breath for Marchin's safety on that one. If the effects man was off his timing, it could have been a big problem. But it all went off well, and I'm glad that was over and the shot in three cans.<br /><br />With the large beginning and ending we also had 5 shoot outs and karate action scenes though out the movie. Well, we did get the project done on a 5 to 1 film ratio, and finished in 21 days. I think "Omega Cop" is a great example of what you can do with limited film, money, and star actor's schedules. I'm proud of this movie because of it.

 | product/productId: 076400462X | review/userId: A20IIR0422G3A5 | review/summary: Lost & great the first time around, but pales after the 2nd | review/text: `The Last Valley', written, produced, and directed by novelist, James Clavell was, in my mind, a viable candidate for being an underappreciated gem of a movie. Before I bought the DVD, I had seen the movie but once on commercial TV in the 1970's and the memory of the movie has stayed with me ever since. The most distinctive aspect of the story is that it deals with an historical period that is almost totally unknown to most Americans who are neither professional historians nor history buffs. Even many events in the history of ancient Greece and Rome are probably better known to many than the story of the 30 years war which by some accounts could be counted as a `world war', running from 1618 through 1648 and creating, in the process, some of the most memorable figures of modern European history such as the French king Louis XIV (the Sun king), Cardinal Richilieu, Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, and general Wallenstein, the subject of a Schiller dramatic trilogy in the 19th century. As told by a brief introductory blurb at the beginning of the movie, this war began as a religious war between Protestant and Catholic, but devolved into a purely political struggle between France, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire, and the larger German states such as Bavaria. This was so destructive that some history books I have read have said that Germany did not recover from the effects until its unification by Bismarck in the 19th century.<br /><br />In it's broadest terms, the outline of the plot is very similar to other movies such as `The Magnificent Seven / The Seven Samurai' and `The Thirteenth Warrior' where a band of trained soldiers comes to the aid of a village. Since these three movies are so good, one tends to set high expectations for `The Last Valley' with a similar plot. The fact that there are some differences in setting are irrelevant to the quality of the movie. In `The Last Valley', the soldiers are not invited or contracted to come into the village. This company of about thirty mercenaries, lead by captain Michael Caine stumble upon this isolated, hidden village in a remote valley somewhere near the headwaters of the Rhine in southern Germany where the winter snows blocks the passes into the village for half the year.<br /><br />The company is foraging for food as an advance or detachment from a larger army that may or may not be nearby. Expectations on what the mercenaries will do to the village are set by the PG rated violence seen behind as the movie opens as other villagers are robbed, raped, and killed out of hand, if they have not already fallen victim to the plague. By coincidence, the village is also found at the same time by a wandering scholar, Vogel, played by Omar Sharif, who ends up being the mediator between the captain and the town leader, Gruber. In the course of just a few minutes, Vogel convinces the captain to `move in' on the valley rather than carrying off all its goods. The speed with which the captain agrees to this is a sign of how week was the allegiance of soldiers to the causes for which they fought. In this war, it was much more profitable, and probably even a bit safer to be a soldier than to be a farmer. The captain and his loyal lieutenants summarily kill the very few members of this company who object. I was just slightly annoyed at this as one of those killed off after about 3 minutes on the screen is a mercenary played by Brian Blessed who was featured as Caesar Augustus in the PBS series `I, Claudius'.<br /><br />While the southern German village was naturally Catholic, the band of mercenaries was a gemish of Catholics and Protestants and only a few of the Protestant soldiers had strong feelings about the existence of the Catholic church and a minority of soldiers showed Catholic leanings when the captain moves a shrine from the path leading to the village.<br /><br />All of this setup is the platform upon which Clavell presents his primary idea that this war has killed God, primarily at the especially bloody (historically accurate) battle of Magdeburg that occurred ten years before the time of the movie. The captain states that Magdeburg was razed in retaliation to the siege of some other city which was attacked to pay for the distruction of some other town which was destroyed to avenge the sack of some village and on and on and on, and God has done nothing to stop it. This speech is the linchpin of the whole movie, as it resonates all the way back to Greek tragedy where a vendetta between two families is only stopped by judges who claim the authority of the gods, so their decision cannot be avenged by further violence. All this is boiled down to the simple quote from the Bible of `Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord'. But at Magdeburg, the Lord seems to have disappeared from its role in human life.<br /><br />All this is great stuff and everything connected to this worldview in the movie makes some sense. The only problem is that moviemaker Clavell does not give us much on which to develop an interest in whether these characters live or die. A simple comparison between our feelings for these villagers and the Mexican peasants in `The Magnificent Seven' shows us that the characters in `The Last Valley' have about as little soul as the missing God whose lack of attention has created these scenes of distruction straight out of a painting by Breughel. The only interest is in the chess game of force and allegiances played out between the captain, Vogel, Gruber, and the captain's troops.<br /><br />The DVD has no extras to speak of. Unlike `The 13th Warrior', I think this movie deserves the obscurity into which it has fallen.

 | product/productId: 6300181529 | review/userId: A2CGZCNFQIPS9F | review/summary: A Little Known Gem | review/text: I first saw this film in a Hitchcock class at UCLA in 1982, and I've never forgotten it. With its elements of macabre suspense, drama, and comedy, it could be termed "faux Hitchcock."<br /><br />Cary Grant is excellent as the good guy/bad guy/good guy who changes identities every 5 minutes, and what can you say about Audrey Hepburn?  Every film she was ever in benefitted from her screen presence.  The bantering and chemistry between the two is something special to watch.<br /><br />The DVD is a very poor transfer, and if you're looking for a high quality digital transfer, don't look here.

 | product/productId: 0792837924 | review/userId: A2F7KIN0SL00I6 | review/summary: Look at Me, Harry!! | review/text: I can watch this movie over and over again.  I have to admit the first time I watched it I got a little lost on who was who and what was what, but after seeing several more times this has to be one of the funniest movies.  John Travolta is perfect as Chili Palmer.  Dennis Farina is perfect as the role of Ray Barbone.  It's a wonderful movie and if you pay close enough attention you'll notice that the five main characters (Travolta, Russo, DeVito, Hackman, and Farina) all say the phrase &quot;Look at Me&quot; at least once.  I don't know why it isn't called &quot;Look at me&quot;.  Very entertaining.
 | product/productId: 6301115848 | review/userId: A39VJRIW7HC5C0 | review/summary: Definitive Cold War Film | review/text: The 1950's brought many films that contain thinly veiled references to Communism, the bomb scare, or McCarthyism, and while some weren't so good, like the Thing from Another World, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the best and one of the better horror movies from the 1950's.<br /><br />The plot of the film is well-known, in large part due to a slew of remakes and reworkings, most recently 1998's The Faculty: creatures that come from large seed pods take over humans and replace them with slightly altered variants, or "pod people."  When Dr. Miles Bennell returns to his hometown of Santa Mira, it seems that many of the dozens of people who clamored for his assistance have cancelled their appointments, but those have not tell about how their relatives appear different.  Through a series of events and occurances it becomes clear to Dr. Bennell that something very wrong is going on in Santa Mira, and the rest of the world is next.<br /><br />The acting, in particular by Kevin McCarthy as Bennell and Dana Wynter as his love interest Becky, is very solid, and McCarthy's voiceovers help the film instead of hindering it.  The direction by Don Siegal effectively utilizes light and darkness, and succeeds in making a place the size of a town very claustrophobic.  The storyline of the 83 minute film moves very briskly, and the ending is suitably ambiguous, albeit less than it would have been without the annoying bookending sequences.  Highly reccomended, even to horror fans of today expecting a gruesome murder every seven minutes.  8/10
 | product/productId: 078062789X | review/userId: AX7UD41FNEFKT | review/summary: For Depp or serious Sci-Fi fans only. | review/text: I watched this movie for the first time on the DVD.  I think the worst thing about this film is the fact that it makes a comparison to Rosemary's Baby on the box.  Because of that, I went in with a preconcieved notion of  what was going to happen.  The comparison is not fair.  Rosemary's Baby was  a great film, but this movie can stand on it's own without people trying to  fool us into thinking that it is a remake of &quot;Baby.&quot;<p>I am a big  fan of Johnny Depp and I think that he brings a touch of class to all of  his films.  This one is no exception.  Charlize Theron is the persona of  every boy's dream elementary school teacher.  Both give good performances.  Unfortunatley, Johnny's biggest role is to try not to say anything.  I  think that Johnny shows us a different kind of character here than he has  before and if you are a fan of his, it might be worth checking out.<p>To  wrap it up, I think that any science fiction fan would enjoy this film at  least for one watch.  It's easy on the special effects but heavy on the  suspense.  Some sceens were done very well, with a real artistic flair.  Don't read the box before you watch it.  Well, if you are reading this it  is too late to avoid the Rosemary's Baby reference, but ignore it.  This  movie is not Rosemary's Baby.  It may not be a better film, but it is one  worth a watch.  Enjoy!

 | product/productId: 0767812778 | review/userId: A319YRDK8Y39N | review/summary: One of the greatest epics of all time | review/text: Ok, I must admit. I'm a sucker for epics. I love their scope, their feel, the time they take to go over all the details of their subjects' lives. A good epic immerses you into their world. It's good to get lost in an epic, and I got lost in Lawrence of Arabia.<p>Telling the story of T.E. Lawrence in his attempt to bring the feuding clans of Arabs together during the World War II, this film is beautiful in its leisure ness, exciting in its action, and absolutely breathtaking in its cinematography. At the time of its release, it had to be the most beautiful filmed motion picture ever made.<p>Fresh from his success in the film Bridge on the River Kwai, director David Lean sought to make a film of equal greatness. Instead he surpassed it. For any film buffs, Lawrence of Arabia is a must have for their collection. Its influence in modern filmmakers alone is amazing, Steven Spielberg in particular. The wonder Spielberg saw in this film is evident in his own filmography; from the desert scapes in his Indiana Jones films to the intimacy of Schindler's List.<p>Fantastic performances by a young Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast bring the story to vivid life. In particular, O'Toole becomes Lawrence. It's clear the actors believed in their characters, and in the movie.<p>Filled with classic moments that still to this day inspire awe and power in its audiences, such as the slow approach by stranger on horseback to the well Lawrence and his companion drink from, this film is fantastic on all levels. A must-see, must-own for any lover of film.

 | product/productId: 6302263794 | review/userId: A2FEJIORC1MBG3 | review/summary: Ho ho ho! | review/text: Director Ken Russell has never been accused of understatement, and this in-your-face character study of a jaded streetwalker is no exception. Theresa Russell chews major scenery in the lead role. The film has been misunderstood by viewers who miss the black comic undertones (I find it interesting that in 2006, no one blinks at Amy Sedaris' broad portrayal of a 42 year-old ex-hooker going back to high school on Comedy Central's "Strangers With Candy", but we still have reviewers tsk-tsking over Russell's 1991 treatment of the subject!) There are pacing issues that betray the story's stage play origins. Russell's character addresses the audience throughout, making the story a bit "talky" at times. In fact, characters in the film spend much more time TALKING about sex than actually engaging in it! Definitely a cult item. Currently not available on DVD, but used VHS copies can tracked down. Beware of the butchered "R" rated prints; the uncut "European" version contains 7 extra minutes (the excised scenes are actually tame by current standards). A note to my fellow reviewer regarding Ms. Russell's marital status: She is NOT married to Ken Russell, but to director Nicholas Roeg.
 | product/productId: 555843399X | review/userId: A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3 | review/summary: Not for young children but definitely a family film | review/text: This film has some uneven moments and flaws but it is so superior, especially when it comes to thoughtful exploration of ethics, values and how one approachs people of a different culture and background, that it is worth seeing. However, there is definitely some violence, even though nothing graphic is shown on screen. I can't say too much for fear of giving away the plot but I think younger children could be scared by some of what is implied, if not actually shown.<br />  The basic storyline is based on an actual incident involving missionaries who are trying to make contact with an isolated tribe. I found it intriguing that NOT ONCE was the word "Jesus" used in this movie (or, if it was, it must have been only once, because I missed it). Instead, the plot revolves around themes of how one lives in the world and where and when violence is justified.<br />  THe movie could have been preachy, simplistic and patronizing. Because it was made so that families could see it, it WAS probably "cleaned up" a bit and some of the more graphic violence was left out.<br />  But there is still plenty of heft to this film. It doesn't veer away from tackling difficult issues, including questions about how ethical it was to interfere with a tribe that was not used to Americans. There is tragedy and heartbreak.<br />  Several points of view are expressed here and there is far more balance than in a typical Christian film...there is NO overt message being driven home or stated. Everything is implied. This makes for a powerful and moving film and one which may be found more accessable by all viewers, not just Christians. Christians, however, may take issue with the fact that Jesus is not overtly discussed, although it doesn't take much to understand that the film is focusing on Christian missionaries and their interaction with a tribe who doesn't have any idea of Jesus- they have their own religious beliefs.<br />  At the end of the DVD, there is some footage with the son of the man who first ministered to the Indian tribe, footage which reflects on our own culture (and not so positively). There are shots of grocery stores and talk about how little people in America have to do to get food, unlike the Indians who have to hunt their food, prepare it and who also have no access to such conveniences as grocery stores, cars, escalators and elevators.<br />  Watch this one with older children and you may well end up talking about how different cultures view the world, how they live- and why.

However, Toto soon learns that life and fiction don't co-exist in a world of all too real heartaches and tragedy.  Bring Kleenex, for this sumptuously told tale of young love.<br />TRANSFER: Well, let's see...for starters there are two versions of the film on this disc: the original theatrical cut which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and a new director's cut that is 59 minutes longer.  Trust me on this one: you want to see the director's cut.  It fleshes out character motivation and the latter half of the story in ways that make the viewing experience so much richer.<br />Both versions have been 'digitally remastered' in anamorphic widescreen. The original cut is presented in Dolby Stereo, the new version in 5.1 stereo.  Both are visually rather lack luster in their presentation - with overly dark contrast levels and subdued colors. Nevertheless, age related artifacts are not present and aliasing, edge enhancement and some pixelization inherent in the original release are not present on the special edition. Over all the film looks very clean.  Nothing can detract from the performances - there's not a one to fault in this beautifully told masterpiece.<br />EXTRAS: NONE! A genuine shame! No, make that a crying shame!!!<br />BOTTOM LINE: You must see "Cinema Paradiso".  Brilliant, poignant, tragic, but ultimately a moving experience that - in this age of digital generated this and reality based that - will make you remember why it is that we all go to the movies! This is the reason why motion picture entertainment was invented.  A MUST!
 | product/productId: 6301025083 | review/userId: A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ | review/summary: Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other. | review/text: Wow.  Wow.  Double Wow.  I was unsure what I was about to indulge myself in when I first picked up this film.  Foreign, Fellini, and Oscar were all that I knew about this mythological film.  I had read about it in books, read reviews of it on top ten lists, but never found myself in the same room as it.  I wanted to see this so passionately that when it arrived I immediately popped it into my player and began watching it.  What I witnessed was like a drug on the brain.  The images, the story, the sheer brilliance and force behind the crafty eye of Fellini brought me deeper into this film than any other I have seen.  This is not easy for me to say because I have seen tons of films in my lifetime, but this film really takes the cake.  The brilliant black and white photography, the powerful ear-gobbling music, and the acting - Marcello Mastroianni controls this film.  You cannot seem to get your eyes off his scenes.  All of these elements create an innovative, provocative film based loosely on the life of Fellini, but also about the competitive and dragging world of film creation.<br /><br />From the opening scene, the tone is set in this film.  As we see Guido (Mastroianni) trying to escape a smoking car while nobody tries to help, we are captured.  The senses are heightened, and claustrophobia sets in and never leaves throughout the rest of the film.  Fellini has trapped us into this character and is beginning our roller-coaster ride known as Guido's life.  As we meet the rest of the characters, that looming claustrophobia continues to stay with us.  We add to this grab bag of emotions the struggle that Guido has with women, the stress pressures of completing a film that he has no clue how to start.  The only idea he has deals with a large structure that seems to keep the producers at bay.  Couple with this his struggling childhood memories of women and the angry power of his wife.  It is hard not to be involved with Guido throughout the course of this film because of these intense emotions that Fellini has fed to us.<br /><br />Outside of the emotional aspects of this film, it is beautifully directed.  Fellini pulls no stops (nor does Criterion) in the creation of this film.  The music, the actors, and even the beauty of the random, chaotic scene works to perfection everytime.  This is not a film you can sit down and enjoy once, it is definitely one that needs to be played over and over again.  In the film Sideways, Giamatti's character talks about wine being "never the same each time you drink it".  Each sip produces a new flavor and even if you open another bottle of the same, it may not be able to replicate the same exact taste.  That is how I feel about this film.  The first time I watched it, I was oblivious to the surroundings and the sub-stories.  I was so engulfed with Guido that I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  If I were to watch 8  again, focusing on a different aspect, I am sure to see a different film than I originally saw.  That is the greatness of Fellini, he directs so that each time you watch you are constantly seeing something new.  I saw that with his film Juliet of the Spirits as well.  I am not as voiced in Fellini as I should be, but these two films have proved that I need to see more and more of his work.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film for a direct reason.  You don't see this technique used in many Hollywood films today, and I think that is why it caught my eye in Fellini's masterpiece.  You could be sitting in a room full of friends and family, and honestly each person in the room (as the final credits ran) would say that they saw a different film than what you thought.  It is like going into an art museum for the first time.  You can all look at the same visions, but it is how you perceive these visions that makes it a great piece of art.  Fellini did this with 8 .  I don't know if it was on purpose, or if he had a direct vision for some of the scenes, but when it was done there were several different thoughts about this film.  I guess what I am trying to say is that it creates conversation.  This isn't a film that you sit down, watch, and walk away without a word muttered through your lips.  This is a piece of art that will remain in your mind long after the film is over, causing questions to arise days, weeks, months after viewing.  I still ask questions about Guido's dream where the women from his past and present all live in the same house as him.  It is so deep and beautiful that it erupts with conversation daily.  I find that a great tool for grading films is how much conversation occurs after them.  Good or bad, if you can talk about it at lengths with friends, than you know you have something special on your hands.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  While the ending was a bit confusing, I continued to think about it long after the film was over and came to realize that Fellini is a master of film.  I cannot wait to watch this film again, and again, and again.  It should have won for best film of the year in 1964, or at least for best director, but alas, I can live with the best Foreign Film of the year.  This film should be at or near the top of everyone's favorites list and should be served with an amazing red wine, an open mind, and good friends.  It is the perfect combination for this priceless film.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****

I like Ashley Judd and though I cannot stand Greg Kinnear I also &quot;adore&quot; Hugh Jackman since his arrival in X-Men and wanted to give it a try.<p>I guess...I wished there was either more to it or the parts that WERE in it were just played out better. I was disappointed in Ashley's Judd's character and her &quot;Old Cow&quot; routine. It got a little...sickening. Not that I didn't agree on some fronts but the whole movie was about her selfishness and pity party.<p>Hugh Jackman was a good time almost classical &quot;jerk&quot; sometimes which made him adorable but I think he was the one that lit the stage in this performance. Ashley either should have left the role to &quot;Someone Else&quot; or...fought with the director to change her character...
 | product/productId: 5555670044 | review/userId: A30N4CJVI6U4XE | review/summary: The fateful magic of "True Grit" | review/text: When discussing fondly remembered films, the 1969 western "True Grit" certainly ranks somewhere near the top-10. This is not to say "True Grit" is one of the greatest westerns ever made - it's not - nor one of John Wayne's greatest films - it's not. But let's not get lost just yet. A sanitized though faithful adaptation of Charles Portis's brilliantly succinct and humorous novel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159020459X">True Grit</a>), it is perhaps best known as the film that gave the Duke a glorious opportunity to finally win the Oscar. He does not disappoint. As Rooster Cogburn, the cantankerous one-eyed Marshall who loves to "pull a cork," Wayne chews the scenery and rings every bell. It would have been difficult for him to miss the mark. Wayne not only hits the target, but every year of his vast experience is utilized, a skilled iconic professional with just enough salt to slam the home run.<br /><br />Wayne went on record to say his finest moment of acting was the famous campfire scene when Rooster discusses his past, most notably as owner of a restaurant "The Green Frog." It's an incredible passage, sparked by the howling of nearby wolves, that resonates as a memorable snapshot. So much of my personal memory of this film is intertwined with viewing it with my family at the drive-in. To this day I recall the adult laughter, applause and intense enjoyment. And who doesn't feel goosebumps when Wayne - err Rooster - rides into the clearing and faces down Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall)?<br /><br />Like Wayne, director Henry Hathaway was rapidly approaching the end of a robust career often spent in the sticks filming oaters. And like the Duke, Henry still had just enough muscle to bring this film home (he had previously directed the excellent western <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMR3">Nevada Smith</a> in 1966). He knew what he had and how to film it, taking full advantage of a glorious Colorado landscape (that's supposed to be Oklahoma, but it's obviously not). Every scene glistens, and he knew exactly where to place his performers for full affect. Ultimately, he paints an old-fashioned Hollywood canvas, expensively accented with the extraordinary musical score of Elmer Bernstein (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQGR6">True Grit [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>]) and artistic cinematography of Lucien Ballard, the end result an antique genre scrapbook colored gold with lantern light. "True Grit" trots through the land of myth rather than revisionism popular at the time.<br /><br />After the murder of her father by the evil Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), young teenager Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) hires U.S. Marshall Cogburn to track him down in the wilds of the Indian territories. They are joined on their adventure by Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) and ride dramatically through breath-taking vistas hoping to stumble upon Chaney and his colorful comrades. There are a handful of wonderful performances here, including Wayne, Darby, a young Duvall and even Strother Martin as a frustrated horse trader. Campbell, a likably talented songwriter, is sadly not up to the task. With all of the storied character actors available at this time - James Caan, Gene Hackman, George Kennedy, Warren Oates - filmmakers decided upon Campbell?! His stiff portrayal in a crucial role substantially weakens the film. Wayne had a peculiar habit of insisting upon popular singers to play supporting roles (Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton). Blame him when uncovering one of the reasons "True Grit" does not achieve true greatness.<br /><br />I revisit "True Grit" often when in a sentimental mood, enjoying it's nostalgic allure. Wayne had made three terrible films in a row ("The War Wagon," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599YO">The Green Berets</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783230478">Hellfighters</a>) and the unique magnificence of "True Grit" re-energized a fruitful twilight career for this famous American emblem. Some of those final films were good (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O59A0C">The Train Robbers</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JSGL">The Shootist</a>), some not (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMR4">Big Jake</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599YY">McQ</a>), and there was even enough time for the mediocre sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322592X">Rooster Cogburn (...and the Lady)</a>. But the fateful magic of "True Grit" was rarely equaled during Wayne's final years, and we return to this moment with passionate memory. Here he rode high in the saddle, and tree branches broke against those mighty shoulders. "True Grit" is a tribute, vitalized by the firm foundation of Portis's novel, an enduring example of the gifts of Wayne's dedicated artistry.

I consider myself a coordinated person, but I had difficulty following her moves.  What really made me mad was the fact that her counts were off several times....5 reps to one side, then 7 reps to the other.  I am giving my copy to charity in hopes that somebody other than me will get some use out of the video.  The only saving grace to this video were the leg/butt and ab moves at the near the end.

While not an amazing movie, it holds its own with great performances and some strong drama without getting too overbearing.

 | product/productId: 0792110188 | review/userId: AC0HPFQVBZVGY | review/summary: El Dorado, truly a golden fortune | review/text: This is probably my all time favorite John Wayne movie.  It has it all Action, drama, comedy and even a little romance.  It is not just your standard shoot-em-up, but a great study of characters.  Great performances all around.  A very young James Caan is a green but able kid.  Christopher George is the supremely confident gunman hired by the evil landgrabber, Ed Asner.  Robert Mitchum is the drunken sheriff who must sober up for the fight of his life.  Of course, John Wayne as the hero who must save the day even though he suffers with a handicap of his own.  Great support from recognizable actors Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicut, R. G. Armstrong,and Jim Davis.  While there is plenty of action in this movie, appreciate the interplay between the characters.  The dialogue comes relaxed and easy.  It is just some great entertainment.

Whether or not you believe in this sort of thing, the message that comes through is one of empowerment for all.  Ramtha's teachings are that of self awareness and the conquering of all of our individual fears that bind and hold us back from true happiness.<br /><br />The DVD itself is taken from Knights seminars and lectures from the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, during which she channels the entire program.  It is theatrical and memorizing when you tune into the core message.  The production quality is good and the seminar is lengthy so it is worth checking out.  If you are into spirituality that has a base in quantum physics and you enjoy theatrical presentations then you will enjoy this DVD and the message that comes forth. I give this DVD 5 stars based on content and message.<br /><br />For more on me and my work: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557033799">The Master Within</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557538033">Axiatonal Integration</a>

 | product/productId: 6301903242 | review/userId: A27RJ30RN5K9MX | review/summary: Excellent Gangster film | review/text: Terry Noonan (Sean Penn) returns to Hell's Kitchen after a ten year absence. He immediately falls back in with his childhood friend Jackie ( Gary Oldman), whose brother Frankie ( Ed Harris)is now running a powerful Irish mob. Frankie's organization is looking to make a deal with the Italian Mafia, and Jackie wants Terry brought in to make things run smoother. Unfortunately, Terry is also an undercover cop, and his sole purpose for coming back is to infiltrate Frankie's organization. Things become even more complicated, when Terry manages to rekindle an old romance with Jackie's sister Kathleen (Robin Wright). Now Terry is torn between his job, and remaining loyal to his friends and the woman he loves.<p>When people bring up the subject of mob films, State of Grace is never mentioned. The story behind the film is very captivating because it shows the fine line between standing by your friends, and doing what's right. The film does a very good job at masking Terry Noonan's intentions because you can never tell which side he is truly playing for. State of Grace is an original in the mob genre because it offers a look at the Irish mob, instead of the Italians. The Irish are natural born fighters and extremely violent. This is what made State of Grace such a powerful mob film. The cast is first rate in this film featuring Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Robin Wright, John C. Reily, and John Turturo. Each actor involved was brilliant in their roles.<p>Overall, State of Grace is probably one of the best mob films I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated films ever made. The story was captivating from beginning to end, the entire cast did a first rate job, and you get to take a first hand look at the Irish mob.<p>A solid 5 stars...
 | product/productId: 0788838369 | review/userId: A2C5LA07JCDWTN | review/summary: Built like an Acorn Tree: Strong and Sappy | review/text: The story of Jim Morris couldn't be more inspirational. A near 40 year old high school science teacher/baseball coach who makes a bet with his team that if they win a playoff game then he will try out for a major league team. Well needless to say, Morris' high school team wins the championship and the players all tell him "it's your turn coach". Jim goes to try out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with his 3 small children with him and without his wife knowing. Well, Jim winds up throwing harder than he ever has in his life, 98 mph! Jim is now faced with the gut wrenching decision of having to leave his family that he adores or pursue his dreams. The Rookie plays out way too sappy for me, there are an abundance of overly sentimental moments in the film that for continuity's sake should have been sped up. But hey we're talking a G rated Disney film, here! Anyway, baseball fans and fans of the underdog alike will love this film. Recommended.
 | product/productId: 6300248143 | review/userId: A2IYUCI5A26O82 | review/summary: Not the original but great in its own way | review/text: I don't normally care for sequels, but the few exceptions I find are in the sci-fi genre. Then again this is almost not a sequel. Yes Cameron uses many of the invidious topos from the original, but they are desparate enough in approach to make the link between the two almost circumstantial. Where &quot;Alien&quot; was primarily a psychological horror film (complete with underlying mysogamy and rape symbolism), &quot;Aliens&quot; is an action-packed, in your face, frenzy. This inverse structure was very prescient on Cameron's part. He took a good tale of terror, a vile, redoubtable villain and really shook up the mix. And by adding more creatures he increases the horror expotentially.<br /><br /> He did keep one aspect of the precursor in tact, as well he should have: Changes in technology are present with futuristic equipment, but the characters stay very human (the Marines talk like Marines, corporate greed subverts survival, etc). Also there is some clever dialogue. My two favorites: Newt ominously stating &quot;They mostly come out at night...mostly&quot; and Bill Paxton (perfect in his comic relief assignment) telling Paul Reiser, &quot;Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked&quot;.

 | product/productId: 6301976886 | review/userId: A30TK6U7DNS82R | review/summary: Elvis Excelsis | review/text: Hooray, SPINOUT on DVD at last!  One of Elvis' 60s movies, about which all you can say is, if you like them, you love them.  Somewhere along the way, Elvis stopped really caring about everything except Gladys, and the scripts suffered.  They were all the same with plenty of innuendo, but not much real sex.  Except of course that sex is omnipresent in the air, it's built into each frame of film like a poltergeist nimbus in a haunted house.  SPINOUT features Elvis opposite the perplexing pixie Deborah Walley, who often played a kind of tomboyish girl yearning to be a woman, the parts Debbie Reynolds owned a decade earlier.  And yet Walley is extremely sexy, just not in this film.  The other guys Elvis has to compete with aren't in his league, but they're not bad looking, at least Will Sugarfoot Hutchins and Carl Betz from the Donna Reed Show are passable and here even Warren Berlinger from BILLIE looks pretty sharp.<br /><br />However in every department the women outclass them, from Deborah Walley in torn sweatshirts and pink Capris, to ultra-chic Diane McBain an "author" like Helen Gurley Brown of sex manuals for bachelorettes, to Shelley Fabares, the millionaire daughter of Carl Betz--a casting move that will leave you scratching your head if you remember her playing the same part in The Donna Reed Show.  As many have noted, the final number is the best--I'LL BE BACK, sung by Elvis and band in a bohemian basement nightclub with weird proto-Dufy paintings on the walls and candles stuck in Chianti bottles, and the band drives the crowd to their feet eventually, everyone doing the Frug and the Monkey in wild 60s abandon.

 | product/productId: 0783235968 | review/userId: A2H79GB6TP9E6K | review/summary: The perfect movie? | review/text: "Field of Dreams" very well may be a perfect movie. I don't know anyone who didn't like it. The film's moral message had a profound impact on me. I first saw it when I was a little kid and loved it; I understand and love it even more today.<br /><br />The story is about an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and his family. Kinsella hears a voice one day while walking in his cornfields. It tells him "if you build it, he will come." He interprets it that if he builts a baseball diamond in his cornfield, Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) will appear again. Kinsella proceeds to built it, and magical things begin to happen.<br /><br />I won't go any farther. "Field of Dreams" is another example of how utterly dumb the Academy Awards are. It lost the Best Picture honor to "Driving Miss Daisy." Whatever. Kevin Costner does a great job in the lead role. The script was sublime, and the rest of the acting was as well. James Earl Jones stands out as a reclusive writer, and Burt Lancaster makes an excellent impression in his last film. And pay attention to James Horner's mystical score, especially in the last 10 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />"Field of Dreams" is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. At least not me. A real American classic, it's the "place where dreams come true."

A lot of the reviewers are trying to compare Robert Heinlein's book to the movie.  They are two different animals. Look at "Minorty Report" by Phillip K Dick.  In my opinion, nothing like the movie.  I'm just going to review the movie because that is what this is about.<br /><br />I found that I actually cared for these characters.  I enjoyed this film from begining to end.  I even liked the Zoe Poledouris version of the David Bowie song "I Have not Been to Oxford Town" at the Graduation Dance.<br /><br />This film can be analyzed as a Nazi propaganda film or as a critique of Fascism or as a good, fast paced, sci-fi flick.  This movie was created to entertain and that it does.  I was suprised by one thing however, that Casper Van Dien could carry this film, but he does!<br /><br />There is plenty of nudity in this movie which I thought was overdone.  I was plesantly suprised of hardly any profanity though.  Kudoes to Verhoeven and Industrial Light and Magic for a classic.

If you want to see a movie that bases its account of Jesus Christ on the New Testament texts ... look elsewhere.<p>But, if you want to see a groovy movie that purports to be about "Jesus" -- though certainly many steps removed from the person and personality one encounters in the Gospels and the other writings of the New Testament -- well, hey, no one is stopping you from watching this politically-correct and religiously-benign dog about a Jesus who doesn't know who he is or what his mission is or what he's supposed to do -- except die for "love" for some cockamamie reason.

 | product/productId: 1561270652 | review/userId: A3UA8GKLW7DHYJ | review/summary: Kiri the legendary soprano | review/text: This is Kiri Te Kanawa at her finest.  On this excellently transferred DVD we get to see her perform in her home country New Zealand and at a beautiful English chapel.  The energy and excitement of the outdoor NZ concert really breathe through the screen.  She sings &quot;Io son l'umile ancella,&quot; &quot;In quelle trine morbide,&quot; &quot;Pace, pace, mio dio,&quot; &quot;Tu, che di gel sei cinta,&quot; AND &quot;Ch'il bel sogno di Doretta,&quot; one of her signature arias, which is mysteriously OMITTED from the listing on the back and inside covers!  (It is itself worth the price of the DVD.)  The NZ selection concludes with two Maori songs, one of them sung a capella, and &quot;I Could Have Danced All Night.&quot;  The second half of the program consists of two Handel arias (&quot;Non disperar&quot; and &quot;Care selve&quot;) and Mozart's &quot;Exsultate, jubilate!&quot; in its entirety.  Everyone familiar with Kiri Te Kanawa knows that she never leaves one of her headlining concerts without singing &quot;O mio babbino caro&quot;, which here runs during the end credits.  A very satisfying program.  Note that between a few segments there is commentary by Kiri, which ties the whole program together very nicely.  No subtitles.  Excellent sound.  Winner of the Silver Medal in Arts Performance at the 1993 NY Intl Film and TV Festival.

This movie epitomizes how greed was interwoven into the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's.  Oliver Stone's depiction of this time in American history is extremely well done.  The extras in this DVD give the viewer a behind-the-scenes look at the actors and the legacy of this classic film.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who values great acting and excellent character development.

This film made Pitt a star and sex symbol, his acting is brilliant, not just another pretty face. Anthony Hopkins, Henry Thromas, and Aidan Quinn also star. Julia Ormond plays the young lady of the three brothers affection, she has feelings for all of the them especially Tristan (Pitt) but their love cannot endure and tragedy strikes and the ending may leave you shocked and disappointed but I highly recommend this strong and passionate story, enjoy!

BY JASON RHODES. | review/text: Last Tango in Paris must, be considered, the 'FlagShip Movie'in its genre of Arthouse &amp; international. Marlin Brando takes thelead part, and the command he exhibits over this difficult role, in conveying the depth, and complexity of his character in the film, (Paul), together with the empathy that must be required to fully portray, and give life to, the isolation, and at times despair, with which his character is consumed; allows us, as an audience, to become almost completely immersed, in the poignancy that is so much a part of this film.<p>To many, Last Tango in Paris, has become thought of as a classic, unsurpassed in its ability to move its audience.  The plot centres almost exclusively, around the development, and inevitable break, in the relationship between Paul, an estranged, American Ex-Serviceman, living abroad in France, and his Much younger Parisian lover, played by Maria Schneider.<p>There are very few other characters in this film, and although the overall atmosphere is quite surreal; the detail, and paradoxically, the realism, that this allows, puts the films Direction, in a class of its own; briliant in its individuality.<p>This is a must for anybody who takes Film seriously, and indeed, all those who enjoy Cinema, at its absolute best.

 | product/productId: 6301976061 | review/userId: A13E0ARAXI6KJW | review/summary: Powerful Ensemble Performance in Still Potent Jury Room Drama | review/text: With the recent deaths of Jack Warden (just this past week) and John Fiedler, only Jack Klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director Sidney Lumet. Written by veteran TV scribe Reginald Rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a Manhattan jury room. Already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. Over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting.<br /><br />The chief battle occurs between Juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and Juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. The drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. It certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. Never the most subtle of actors, Lee J. Cobb is a blustery force as Juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict.<br /><br />E.G. Marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while Edward Binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. Warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, Fiedler (later memorable as the meek Mr. Peterson on "The Bob Newhart Show") is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, Martin Balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and Robert Webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd.<br /><br />The most vivid impressions are left by Ed Begley's unapologetic racist, George Voskovec's dignified watch maker, Joseph Sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and Klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. The film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. The black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 DVD but little else except the original theatrical trailer. A masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.

Wonderful Film ! | review/text: Even now, after seeing &quot;The Pianist&quot; from Polansky, I think that SHINE is equally or even a more &quot;brilliant&quot; film, let's say... And in fact the main Shine Actor role demands such an interpretation that we don't see in &quot;The Pianist&quot;, which actor almost look the world on a passive way... Shine, on the other hand, is an amazing film, it's actor seems to really incorporate and love the character !! Shine exuberates in love for life in such a way that it literally extracts tears from our eyes.<br />Perhaps if the &quot;The pianist&quot; actor would be that one of Shine, the result could be better.<br />In a phrase: Shine is one of the best all time movies.

I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone.
 | product/productId: 0790734737 | review/userId: A3KOVFORKXQ2U9 | review/summary: Mad  About  John | review/text: There's no denying that John Travolta's taken his fair share of knocks over the years, the least derserving of which he took upon the release of Mad City.  Not only is his performance not bad, it's one of the finest of his career and hands down his best since Pulp Fiction.  He plays an inept security guard on the short end of a museums down-sizing when he decides to take back his job, at gunpoint if he has to.  This triggers a chain of events the has him taking hostages, children mostly, and becoming the biggest story in network news.  To read this you might not expect to find Travolta's character any too sympathetic but he plays it in such a way that you can't help but feel for him and the dilemma in which he faces.<p>Dustin Hoffman plays opposite him as Max, a reporter with an unscrupulous past for manipulating the facts to further his career.  But after locking horns with the networks golden boy (Alan Alda), he finds himself stuck at a small time local news station.  His path to redemption with his colleagues, and ultimately himself, comes in the form of Sam Bailey (Travolta).  Sam's misguided attempt at reclaiming his job becomes a TV sensation, comparable to Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing in it's scope.  Max spearheads the frenzied coverage from inside the building as a lucky coincidence has him being taken hostage himself.<p>With the world watching, Max tries to put a heroic spin on the story but finds himself confronted with a difficult choice.  His career or Sam's life?  And as Max makes his character arch, so too does the audience.  The key to his self actualization is that we're taken along for the ride, following him down that dark road that is network politics.<p>Comparisons to the 1976 classic Network were inevitable and well founded, but this is a different time and the script is updated to reflect the cynicism that has filtered into all of our lives.  You can almost see Travolta yelling out at the top of his lungs, &quot;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!&quot;  He doesn't, of course, and it's to the film's benefit.  His quiet, subtle mannerisms are more telling than any line of dialogue or emotional outburst could ever even think of being.<p>Ted Levine, you ought to remember him as the serial killer Jamie Gum in The Silence of the Lambs, plays a supporting role as the local sheriff trying to achieve notoriety as being the law enforcement offical who &quot;handled&quot; the crisis.  He's perfectly cast, as is every role from the children being taken hostage right down to the &quot;background artists.&quot;<p>And those are just a few of the characters acclaimed director Costa Gavras (Z and Missing) dissects in the course of the drama.  He centers the story as much on being a character study as a look at corporate news and how they spoon feed us their version of the truth.  Deftly written, acted and directed the film's flaws are slight and it's deserving of high praise.<p>Among my few beefs is the inclusion of a moralistic voice in the form of Robert Prosky, whose less convincing and more annoying because of his preachy tone.  That's not to say his performance isn't good or the character isn't necessary to the story, just that it should've been toned down.  Afterall, how many of us really believe he could make it to a producer's status without crossing that &quot;invisable line&quot; of ethical integrity along the way?<p>But aside from that Mad City is a near perfect gem and one of the most underrated movies in a year that provided us with such instant classics as Boogie Nights and L.A. Confidential.
 | product/productId: 076783917X | review/userId: A13ZPQNYAWRII9 | review/summary: In praise of women. | review/text: Another fascinating film from Almodovar, with kinky characters, bright colours and superb performances. This one is about Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a single mother, and how she strives to come to terms with the death of her beloved eighteen year old son who, before her very eyes, is run over and killed instantly by a passing car. Her screech of horror is blood curdling.<p>They have just been to see a production of "A Streetcar Named Desire." to  celebrate her son's birthday and are waiting outside the theatre in the pouring rain to get the autograph of Huma Roja (Marisa Paredes), the star of the play. But she comes out of the theatre too quickly, getting into the taxi, with her drug-addicted lover Nina (Candela Pina), and driving off before he can reach her. It is when he is chasing after her taxi in desperation that the tragic accident happens. <p>When Manuela is able to pull herself together, she decides to go back to Barcelona to give news of the death to her son's father who knows nothing of his son's existence. She left him all those years ago because he was HIV-positive, a transsexual and a prostitute. Twenty years later she finds him near to death with  an Aids related illness, having sometime before passed on the virus to sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a beautiful nun social-worker who shortly afterwards dies giving birth to his son (A beautiful nun going to bed with a transsexual prostitute? I suppose anything's possible. But what does it say about him?). Manuela has only known Rosa for a short time but shows what a stunningly good person she is by spending every moment taking care of her in her last illness; and afterwards adopting her son and taking him back with her to Madrid.  On the way to the hospital Rosa asks for the taxi to stop while she takes one last look at Barcelona's beautiful main square. A moving moment.  <p>Manuela was introduced to Rosa by Agrado (Antonia San Juan) an old friend who is also a transsexual and a prostitute and who when we first see her is about to be raped.  Manuela leaps to her rescue, whacking her assailant over the head with a heavy piece of wood. Agrado then takes her in search of her son's father to a prostitute's work station, where, in the  middle of a great field, a drove of cars  drives around in circles<p>Almodovar always peoples his films with an array of oddball outsiders - usually women, or men wanting to be women - viewing them habitually through benevolent  eyes. He obviously loves women. He thinks they are much better than men, that they make better friends, that they are  better able to confide in each other, to share their feelings and emotions and talk about things that really matter. And this film is a paean to that belief. The warmth and friendship these women show to each other is something to behold.  And so a film containing three tragic deaths and which should  by every expectation be sombre and depressing, is turned into a heart-warming, uplifting ode to the strength of the  human spirit. It contains at least one  memorable  quote. Huma Roja says at one point, " I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."

This HBO documentary proves this (circa 1997). Many lies have been told to us from our government about 9/11.<br /><br />In the documentary the "organizer" of the 1993 WTC bombing, Ramsi Yusef, tells the FBI agent escorting him back to NYC that "Next time we will take them BOTH down". This documentary was shown on HBO almost daily up until the Sept 11, 2001 tragedy- BUT HAS NOT BEEN BROADCAST ONCE SINCE 9/11... Why is that? Why is HBO suppressing this powerful documentary?

 | product/productId: 0790731533 | review/userId: A168PIWEYR9XR2 | review/summary: A classic for our generation... | review/text: While Prince's musical talent is undeniable, his acting talent is quite mediocre.  Regardless, Purple Rain is a classic of the '80s.  Many viewers may accuse Purple Rain of being cheesy but it's a sign of the times (rimshot).  It's hard not to appreciate Prince's egomaniacal performance.  Purple Rain is not just about the music - Prince also deals with his abusive father who chronically beats his wife.  Prince needs to get away sometimes and escape. If life was only as easy to hop on a purple motorcycle with a puffy shirt on and forget all of your problems while Appolonia removes her top for you just because you tell her to. This is how life should be!  There's alot of shlock here but it's worth it.  Though I would definitely say you need to be a fan of Prince to thoroughly enjoy this.

But something MUST be said about the incredible soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann.  I have seen a lot of movies in my time, and there are some great soundtracks out there, but this one is beyond compare.  It is dark and seething and apocalyptic in a way that no other soundtrack I've heard has been able to achieve.  It adds such depth and dimension to the film that there are moments where you almost feel as if you are drowning in the atmosphere that is conjured.  If I were to rate all of best film soundtracks according to how perfectly they match the mood and the undercurrents of the film, this would be, hands down, #1.

 | product/productId: 0790736918 | review/userId: AD3D7DYBSPVOQ | review/summary: Not Historical Fiction | review/text: Well, contrary to the review above of by Chris Labarbara, Native Americans did, (a) capture, (b) kidnapp, and (c) hold hostage settlers of the west.  All you have to do is read, &quot;Captivity of the Oatman girls.&quot; In  1851 nine members of the Oatman family set out for California. Seventy  miles from California a group of &quot;Apache&quot; Indians came to their  camp to beg, grew angry, massacred the family, and took two of the Oatman  children captive. This neuvo idea that all Native Americans are  &quot;Dancing with Wolves&quot; passives is ludicrous.  Everyone knows the  Sioux were one of the most ruthless warrious ever, and gave as well as they  took from the American Calvery and settlers.  Look, not all Native  Americans are what appears in this film, that is logical, but to say this  is Hollywood fiction is trite.
 | product/productId: 0792837894 | review/userId: A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2 | review/summary: Hilarious and Insightful | review/text: At about the same time this movie came out, "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar" was also a hit.  Though both are inferior to "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," this was the stronger American picture.<p>This movie isn't as good as "La Cage aux Folles," on which it's based, because the American subcultures it tries to satirize aren't as distinct from our society as they are from the French equivalents.  The two divergent families have more in common than the two gay lovers in the original.  Still, as Americans are famously resistant to films that aren't in English, a Yank remake isn't a bad idea.<p>The picture is blessed with nuanced performances from Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Dianne Weist, Dan Futterman, Calista Flockhart (wow, she really CAN act), and Hank Azaria.  The strong ensemble is necessary, as the picture is predicated not on "jokes" as such, but on situational subtlety and absurdities.  A lesser cast, or one with even one weak actor, would have fallen down on this material.  The cast at hand soars.<p>This movie focuses on the conflicted station of homosexuals in our society, and with its willingness to partly suspend judgment, it's a breath of fresh air in an often heated debate.  But it also takes on race and gender issues, class concerns, and even the dim view of actors held by the upper classes.  There is so much potential for this picture to fall down and embarrass everyone addressed, and yet it doesn't happen.<p>There is a tendency to stereotype the right-wing characters into slavering Rush Limbaugh caricatures, which undercuts the picture some.  "To Wong Foo" made this same mistake, and only "Priscilla" has really allowed its conservative forces the latitude they deserve.  This flaw, though big, is really the only one this picture brings to the table, and as long as it isn't a deal-breaker, you'll surely enjoy the film, even if you don't agree with it.<p>In the glut of "Gay Crisis" movies put out in the 1990s, this one stands near the pinnacle for its straightforwardness, accessibility, and humor.  If only more movies were like this to address ANY social concern.
 | product/productId: 0783211856 | review/userId: A1AISPOIIHTHXX | review/summary: One of the most important of his career | review/text: I always have this image of a filmmaker who does films that may not be historically important or "serious" films and decides he's going to do one just to show that he can too do films that are not just fluff pieces. Look at Michael Bay. He tries to do films with heart but they end up becoming looking plastic or fake like Armageddon. Then he tries Pearl Harbor and despite the nice looks of Kate Beckinsale and the great job of ILM it's still shot in that kind of MTV style editing where it's too fast to see anything. So Spielberg after making a big hit with Jurassic Park made this next and it's really good, even if you can only watch it now and then.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler started out as not the savior he ended up becoming. He was a war profiteer, womanizer and member of the Nazi party living in occupated Poland. Soon the Jews are rounded up by the Germans and put into camps, overseen by Amon Goethe. First wanting to get money, he decides to "hire" some Jews to save them from the camps. It's only after that it's ordered that Jew bodies be exhumed and burned that he sees the horror(punctuated by a very effective red colored dress amongst the black and white of its surroundings).<br /><br />Shooting in black and white in a way makes the violence a little less so. Some of the Jews that get shot in the head actually have like a gushing of blood, kind of like a tamer version of Kill Bill 1 scenes. The violence is meant to show the horrors of it all without having to kind of get the audience on your side(I still hate that scene in the Pianist where an elderly man is thrown off a balcony). Also the black and white helps one scene where in order to hide, kids go inside toilets, floating around in the...well you know. Wouldn't look appealing in color right?<br /><br />The blonde girl in the red dress actually existed, she wrote a memoir called The Girl in the Red Coat and was named Roma Ligocka. She lived naturally but here she's one of the many bodies sent to be burned. It's there to change Schindler from a laissez-faire attitude about the Jews to something terrible. In a way, he's one of the only sane people in the place, treating Jews like people, like hosing them down with water when they're on trains and kissing a Jewish woman(who's hot by the way, just saying). Performances are great all around, notable being Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />It's easy to understand the noticeable thin extras but you still feel slightly disappointed. You have 2 featurettes: Voices of the Past which is an hour documentary about the Jewish survivors having their recollections videotaped which is the goal of the company featured in the 2nd featurette. The Shoah Foundation videotapes and catalogues their testimonies to have a record of all that happened during the Holocaust. Well they're good in their own way, it still would've helped to have at least something on the film like the interview with Spielberg on the Close Encounters and Jaws DVD's.<br /><br />It's not really a film where you're going to watch it repeatedly but when you do you end up enjoying it.<br /><br />BTW: the man who puts the rose on the grave at the end is Liam Neeson. The actor is supposed to accompany the Jew they portrayed in the film so that's why he's putting the rose down.

 | product/productId: 0790738066 | review/userId: A3K8TYU7UOUTR0 | review/summary: A sentimental 3 stars | review/text: Dammit, I keep pulling for Kevin Costner. He deals in big, big themes: Waterworld, Postman, and, of course, Dances with Wolves. I like a guy that goes for the big ideas and huge Hollywood productions. But the bottom line is Mr. Costner can't edit a film worth a tinker's damn. Also, he is just plain soft at the center and shockingly politically correct, which leads to some truly god-awful dialogue. This film has, at least, an interesting performance from Will Patton, who plays the movie's villain as though constantly wired to an electric charge. The hell of it is, I have liked Costner in his smaller roles, such as the tiny gem, A Perfect World (which boasted one of Clint Eastwood's most effective and understated performances to date) and Silverado. What the hell. It's worth a rental.

 | product/productId: 6302034981 | review/userId: A2WFLPOH43G4V9 | review/summary: Wes Craven's attempt at a realistic horror film | review/text: &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;(1972) is Wes Craven's debut film, that is not a horror film in the sense that &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is but deals with a realistic story of kidnappers and the evil and and horror they can unleash on humans. The film vaguely has an overall sense of the shift from the summer of love to the reality of the end of it with such events as Charles Manson and The Rolling Stone's tragic Altamont concert. There are times in the film where the subject is serious and horrifying (To warn viewers, there are a few scenes that are very brutal that even I had trouble watching) but the film is so low budget and has poor acting and cheesy lines, that you can't help laughing at most of it. For instance, The Bob Dylan look-alike killer who is addicted to Methadone and used by the other killers and the ending (which is obviously where the creators of &quot;Home Alone&quot; got their idea from) where the father and mother wage vengeance on the killers who killed their daughters. You'll get a great laugh at the dad smearing shaving cream on the floor so one of the killers will slip and fall and the way Mom gets revenge on one of the killers is a scene you'll never forget (I don't think this review would get published if I told you.) Oh and you can't forget the inept hillbilly cops and the southern African-American lady with missing teeth. All and all, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; tries to be serious and horrifying but with all that I have described above just ends up by being a good laugh.

 | product/productId: 0792845730 | review/userId: A2Z1OFP7850LW2 | review/summary: A Classic | review/text: Robocop is not to be taken too seriously.  I have read a good number of the online reviews and have to object to the majority of posts that claim the Criterion Collection is not worth it.  <p>There are essentially two  scenes of extra footage which includes extra carnage (the only two scenes  of bonus material).  ED209 implants about twenty more rounds of gunfire  into Kenny's body during it's initial demonstration and Murphy's original  death scene is even more graphic, but at least coherent, in this version.  <p>If you watch the original release, after Weller is shot the first time,  they cut to a full shot where his arm is missing.  I'm not necessarily  saying that this is great because we actually see him lose the arm, but  this is the way Verhoeven intended the film to be, so pay the extra $5 and  get it.<p>The picture quality and sound are fantastic.  The special  features include a storyboard to film comparison which is a feature I would  love to see more DVD releases include.  Most importantly, there is an audio  commentary by Paul Verhoeven himself, which makes it worth the purchase  right there.

The Best Research Yet !!! | review/text: The evidence Dr. Werner has exposed really shows why the theory of evolution is thought of as fact when there is really no fossil evidence at all to back it up. Even a National Television program will bring out fraudulent artifacts... Knowing all along that they are complete frauds by their own hired laboratory... I guess if the findings are not what they want, they just lie!... It really makes me wonder how many other things that they teach are handled the same way... Its sad when the facts no longer matter to science, and lies to us and themselves come so easily... I REALLY HOPE THAT THOSE WHO WATCH THIS MOVIE WILL SPEND SOME TIME DOING EVEN MORE RESEARCH LIKE I HAVE AND FOUND OUT EVEN MORE... WE NEED MORE OF THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH DONE AND SHARED WITH WAY MORE PEOPLE...

 | product/productId: 0780631153 | review/userId: A25FDX17O3QKLT | review/summary: "Have you ever been struck by lightning? It hurts" | review/text: Magnolia is one of those wonderful films that goes beyond the<br /><br />normal boundaries of film. Surprisingly the closest thing I can compare it to is the black and white D. W. Griffith classic 'Intolerance".<br /><br />What Kubrick's Lolita did to have the viewer not just watch but experience paranoia, Magnolia does the same for the experience of synchronicity.<br /><br />The movie is long but more than worth the time invested.<br /><br />A number of stories are woven together. The movie has a definite point but does not preach. Instead it sucks you into to its reality with a pacing worthy of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. Rather than turn this review into a Kubrick lovefest I mention Barry Lyndon because of the masterful way the director slowed down the pace of the modern world to draw the viewer into the world of Thackary's Lyndon. Unlike Barry Lyndon though even though both movies are on the long side the pacing of Magnolia is far from slow.<br /><br />Through the story of a number of stories in Magnolia we experience a whole new out look into the ordinary world, seeing it as a type of hyper-world, and after the movie we are left with the feeling that the world is not so ordinary after all.<br /><br />The idea that our lives are interconnected is not a new one. However it is the subject of "coincidence" that is the predominant one. All of us have at one time or another experienced a coincidence. But what if our world was made up of a series of "coincidences" that had a logic to them. Call them a layers of rhythms that existence beyond our perceptions, call them synchronicity, call them the hand of God, in this movie we are prodded into experiencing ever so gently and with more than a little humor is that something is going on.<br /><br />This is not a conspiracy of nations or shadowy groups we find ourselves commonly seeing in many of today's movies but conspiracies of the universe. And it is not a necessarily disinterested synchronicity in play as there is definitely a touch of karma at play and in the end redemption. The true art of this movie is that we are not told a story we experience it.<br /><br />To summarize the story is to not do it justice however I offer this brief synopsis.<br /><br />The movie is begun with a narator telling the story of three strange incidents in history and then the story begins.<br /><br />  A famous powerful ancient TV game show producer, Earl Partridge, is dying-his death is eminent. He made his fortune in a game show that exploited brainy children. His young wife is addicted to drugs and racked with guilt. Meanwhile Partridge's caring but somewhat emotionally fragile male nurse trys frantically to contact Partridge's son, who is the misogynistic leader of a cult like self improvement group dedicated to taking advantage of women and who disowned his father long ago. Partridge's game show heir, Jimmy Gator, continues the show. He too is dying of cancer. The part of the wreckage of lives Partridge and Gator leave in their wake is the now over the hill Whiz-kid Donnie Smith (played magnificently by William H. Macy) and the current Whiz kid Stanley. All both Stanley and Donnie want is to be loved. In the meantime Gator's daughter, a victim of her father's abuse , attempts to finally have a normal relationship with someone who is caring and human. As twisted as this plot sounds even more twists are revealed.<br /><br /> Although this may sound somewhat like a soap opera it is far from superficial and along with revealing a hyper-real vision of the world in which we live tackles such issues as forgiveness, redemption and damnation without sounding like a Christian sermon. It is what Robert Anton Wilson called "chapel perilous". You may never be the same after seeing this film.<br /><br />The sound track by Aimee Mann greatly adds to the movie.<br /><br />"The book says, we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."<br /><br />  Weird, wise and wonderful.

Visuals: Blacks are washed out, midtones are coarse, visual noise and scars abound.  Sound: there is distortion on all significant sounds- this had been used so much that the sound is uniformly damaged. This is simply one of the most worn-out set of reels I've ever seen, in cinema or on video.  Even the picture on the box looks dreeadful and has a moire pattern.  Bottom line: Avoid- this version is no competition for the entirely servicable earlier release by other parties (though I forget who did it- not Film Forum).

My 2 year yells out the letters and my 1 year old sits with a huge smile on his face while watching it. I particularly like the song about "F" and the little girl who has decided she doesn't want a world with F (sounds like Lily Tomlin narrating), and it's nice to see "M" is for Martha again. I also really like that they run through the alphabet at the beginning and again at the end, while identifying animals whose names begin with each letter.  It's really well done, and focuses on the letters and although Elmo, Zoe and Tali are in it, they aren't as annoying as usual. My 2 year old can recite almost the entire alphabet, and it's a great adjunct to "They might be Giants..ABCs".

 | product/productId: 6300216071 | review/userId: AYRPJESM22ERK | review/summary: A bit more information for you film buffs out there... | review/text: The story of how this film was made is almost as interesting as the film itself. Bogondavich was assigned a ridiculously short period of time by Roger Corman and a very small budget to come up with a contractual-obligation last film quickie for Karloff, with the only condition being that he had to incorporate scenes from the last two AIP Karloff films, flops that the studio was hoping to reawaken interest in. In just a few days, working on a shoestring, first-timer Bogdonavich comes up with this great, self-reflexive, funny, and disturbing film about an aging horror film star who wants to retire, because he feels his old gentle style of scaring people can't compete with modern horrors such as serial killers. This means that the &quot;showdown&quot; at the end of the film, where the sniper fires FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN, is not only great plotting, but thematically relevant; throughout the film, we're asked to consider our desire to watch horror movies in the first place. Anyone who really likes THINKING about cinema should love this -- it belongs on the shelf with PEEPING TOM and REAR WINDOW. It also has one of the funniest things I've seen in cinema -- a scene where Karloff catches his reflection in the mirror in an off-moment and, associating the image with years of monster movies, jumps in fear, before realizing it is only himself he's looking at... A great little movie.
 | product/productId: 6301862023 | review/userId: A477I7WLPOQDL | review/summary: Ghost Dad is funny! | review/text: Ghost Dad stars Bill Cosby as a workaholic father who is never at home and leaves all of his reponsibilities to his oldest daughter.  His oldest daughter begins to resent him when he forgets her birthday.  That day also changes Bill's character life forever when a crazed taxi driver picks him up and runs off the bridge causing him to become a ghost.  Bill is forced to be at the mercy of his children who help him darken his office at work, so he can be seen.  As the movie progresses, Bill's character becomes closer to his children and learns that he needs to make more time for them.  This movie has a lot of Bill Cosby's humor, which is really funny at times.  One of the funniest scenes is with Bill and a guy in England who calls himself &quot;Ed-ith&quot;, instead of &quot;E-dith.&quot;  Definitely see this movie if you like Bill Cosby.
 | product/productId: 1885477961 | review/userId: A2PWB2SSZSBAI0 | review/summary: asperger's understood | review/text: A hopeful and encouraging look at a syndrome lately coming into public awareness and afflicting perhaps 1 in 300 people.  The lifelong eccentric, the silent and aloof child, the loner--Asperger's sufferers perhaps? Coined by Lorna Wing in 1981, the term described the kind of behavior observed by Hans Asperger in 1944. He used the term "autistic psychopathy" to describe 4 unusual Viennese boys.<br />Since Asperger's syndrome (AS) occurs on the autism scale, its dominant characteristics are a lack of empathy, nave, inappropriate, one-sided interaction, little or no ability to form friendships, pedantic, repetitive speech, poor non-verbal communication, intense absorption in certain subjects, and clumsy or odd movements.<br />Attwood includes the Australian scale for AS as well as diagnostic criteria. The following factors seem to be crucial to the long term success of a person with AS: a mentor who understands AS as well as the person himself, providing guidance and encouragement to adapt to social situations; a partner who commits to and compensates for the difficulties the AS person suffers; an engrossing job or special interest; personal acceptance of the AS condition; and finally--a natural recovery.  Some AS sufferers "get it" in their late 20s and 30s, learning the subtleties of non-verbal communication, conversation repair, etc. to such an extent that they are able to continue their lives with only their closest associates knowing of their condition.

These days you get little more than cameo appearances once in awhile as he [sells] himself to meet his bills.  <p>Yes, this film had it censorship problems, but to get something of this intensity on the screen in those days must have been quite an achievement.  It didn't become controversial with blatant language, blood, and nudity that today's films casually crank out.  No, this one got in trouble because it stretched the boundaries of what writing and acting can achieve, and today's movie makers would do well to watch and take notes.  This one displays it's intensity in the brute force of Brando, and the matching of wits with Vivian Leigh...  <p>...  Realize this, and you see a battle that no war movie can exceed.
 | product/productId: 1572522542 | review/userId: A2557G7LH0HLWE | review/summary: &quot;Yehh.... New Yoork..... Shoore..... Communeest....&quot; | review/text: I must say that of all of Godard's films, this must be one of his most coherent and most &quot;accessible&quot; (if that is at all relevant, which is probably is to the casual viewer.  By this I mean that if you were bored  by the political spiels in Weekend, you would not necessarily tire of  this.)  Which is not to say that this film conforms to traditional  cinematic standards, but judging against some of his other works, Pierrot  le Fou is a much &quot;gentler&quot; movie.  Nonetheless, it contains two  of the most fabulous scenes I have ever seen:  the ever-amusing Vietnam  reenactment and [of course] the supremely satisfying ending.  Additionally,  development of character seems to play a larger part in Pierrot le Fou (and  in such others as Contempt) than in many of JLG's others.<p>And to think  that I never understood the lyrics of Sonic Youth's &quot;Heather  Angel&quot; until several months ago...
 | product/productId: 6300158624 | review/userId: A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV | review/summary: A Superb Suspense Thriller | review/text: Too much is often made of the fact that Welles helmed this thriller to convince the studios he could make a commercially successful film without the costly overruns associated with his other projects. Getting lost in the debate over whether he should have given in and made it, or whether it falls short of the genius he was capable of, is just what a fantastic film he did make. The Stranger is, in fact, one of the best suspense thrillers made during the 1940's. Set after WWII in a small Connecticut town where everyone knows everyone else, Victor Trivis' story is told with flair by director Welles. Rather than surrounding himself with familiar faces from his Mercury days, beautiful Loretta Young and Edward G. Robinson round out this engrossing and suspenseful tale of wartime evil waiting for its chance to rise again.<br /><br />Robinson is brilliant as the easygoing Washington agent who allows a Nazi war criminal who has found God, loose, in order to track him to Franz Kindler; one of the most notorious Nazis of all. Wilson (Robinson) loses him in sleepy Harper, Connecticut, and he is suddenly nowhere to be found. He suspects he has been murdered by Kindler, but since no pictures of the mass murderer exist, he must stick around and play detective. Robinson underplays the part of Wilson, giving him humor and determination, and an easygoing persona which other than his three piece suit, fits in more with Harper than Washington. His checker games with the town clerk are fun to watch. But this is a Welles' film, after all, so something sinister must be alive and well also.<br /><br />Welles takes his cue from Robinson, portraying Professor Charles Rankin (Kindler) with style, but not the brooding focus he might have otherwise. He is about to marry the beautiful daughter of a Supreme Court Justice on the day Wilson and his old pal arrives in Harper. Loretta Young is at her most stunning here, and does a fine job as Rankin's wife. She loves her husband and is completely fooled. Wilson nearly dismisses him as a suspect as well after a grand dinner table speech about ridding the world of evil, until he suddenly realizes Kindler has made a slip! What follows is a game of cat and mouse, tensions escalating as Mary's (Loretta Young) younger brother becomes a quiet ally of Wilson's. Richard Long, who would go on to play Jarrod in The Big Valley on television is good as her caring brother, Noah.<br /><br />Charles spins a web of convincing lies to Mary until Wilson plants the seed of doubt. He knows once Kindler senses weakness, it is only a matter of time until he makes his move. But it is a dangerous plan which could cost Mary her life. An atmospheric score by Bronislaw Kaper and some nice noir touches from cinematographer Russell Metty add up to a fabulous time at the movies. While it may not have been cinematically innovative, this thriller about evil residing in sleepy surroundings and good desperately trying to triumph makes for grand entertainment. A fine film in the genre.

 | product/productId: 6302055067 | review/userId: A1HQ0BLRMRTS1J | review/summary: Leonard Maltin [once again] left clueless | review/text: This film is flawless. Don't let the TRULY pretentious Shakespeare snobbery of the reviewers put you off if you're fans of the mob genre or the greatest writer of all time. Done with a more modest indie budget, it compares equally with "Goodfellas" or any other example you care to name and the Shakespearean quality remains in the timelessness of human lust for power.  Maltin's talking about flashlights shows a genuine density of insight, as the character is actually wandering at night in a trance of insanity. Its not about sleeping disorders, Leonard!<p>Turturro by the way gives this film his best performance ever and all the casting is outstanding.
 | product/productId: 0783246641 | review/userId: A3KOVFORKXQ2U9 | review/summary: An  American  Classic | review/text: Mesmerizing adaptation of the controversial novel by the same name, American Psycho scores on every conceivable level.  As a psychological thriller there are none better.  As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.  And as a black comedy it's rivaled only by the 1989 cult classic Vampires Kiss, to which it bears a striking resemblence.  In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.<p>Christian Bale, his name above the title for the first time in his career, stars as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who may or may not be a serial killer, depending on your point of view.  By that I mean, second time director Mary Harron (avoiding the sophomore slump) leaves the movie open to interruption.  And if you're looking for easy answers there aren't any here.  The euphoric tone in which the story unfolds seems to suggest, in retrospect, that the movie may actually be the elaborate fantasy of a very deranged individual.  Or maybe it's the setting, Reagan-era New York, that makes it seem so alien.  Either way it's a tremendously thought-provoking film that should have people talking for a long time to come.<p>Just imagine if Leonardo DiCaprio were in the lead?  It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.  But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!  It's not that Chris Bale looses himself in the character so much as Patrick Bateman has no character, and it's that understanding that he brings to the role.  He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.  And he does, which is most disturbing of all.  Not the blood or the gore, which is toned down from the book, but the fact that he fits in so well.  Maybe that's the most tellling statement of all, to say that society bears the responsibilty for having created the Patrick Bateman's of the world.<p>His rampage begins by taking the life of a homeless man, to which he feels his financial status entitles him to.  He moves on to supposed &quot;productive&quot; members of society who, despite all their money, never seem to be doing much work.  It's then, after killing Paul Allen (Jared Leto), that he finds himself being questioned by a private investigator (Willem Dafoe), seemingly more interested in flirting with him than interrogating him.  I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.<p>Especially interesting of that bunch is Cara Seymour in a performance so drop dead hysterical (excuse the in joke) that she'll have you laughing long after the movie's over.  She plays Christie, a street walker who falls victim to Bateman's most violent fantasy.  This is one of those tongue-in-cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.<p>Of course, I don't mean to suggest this for everybody, because as most of the best films usually are, it's of an acquired taste.  Anyone not willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise should be advised to stay away.  Especially when you consider you're being asked to invest in a protagonist who has essentially no redeeming qualities except for the fact that he's potrayed by an actor of immeasurable talent, Christian Bale, whose sure to win over more fans (known as Baleheads) with this star-making performance.<p>So for those of you with no qualms over endearing yourself to a really bad guy, you're in for a smart, scary thriller that's one of the most chilling of this or any other year.

In this film, she is excellently portrayed by Genevieve Bujold  as a vibrant, independent, free-spirited young woman who captivates Henry  VIII (a dominant, vital and often maddening Richard Burton) and sparks the  beginning of the Reformation in England. Anthony Quayle gives a fine  performance as Anne's nemesis, Cardinal Wolsey. The film is faithful to  history, and Anne's character is so winningly played by Bujold that her  downfall and untimely death will elicit your sympathy. This is a colorful,  exciting and extremely watchable historical drama. A must-see for anyone  who loves English history.

At the time I was 10 or 11. On the shelf, I saw that green box showing a picture of three men carrying another on their shoulders.  I asked my father what was this movie about, but he refused to talk about it.  He only told me I was too young to see it.  To convince me, he added a description of the broken arm...<p>I listened to him and waited.  I finally saw the movie a couple of years ago, and was fascinated by its hidden complexity.  To me it's about time passing us by, and the contrast between timespeed in the city and in the wilderness.  It's also about human duty : what do we exist for.  It's about destiny, and a banjo playing in the back of one's mind...

 | product/productId: 080017948X | review/userId: A18U19F8P6NHYR | review/summary: Frantic, Romantic Comedy - a must !! | review/text: I thought that Groundhog Day was a very original film - so if you are looking for originality, this is the one. <p>As far as humour is concerned,  Bill Murray is perfect for the role, being a &quot;Pre-Madonna&quot;  weatherman who is too in love with himself to see that he is in a  &quot;dead end&quot; job going no-where, and everyone hates him. <p>The  Film is, in many ways, like the clasical shakesphere idea where the main  character suffers the pain of self realisation before he evolves or  develops from bad into good, evil into angelic - take King Lear for an  example. <p>Going to the Annual Groundhog festival in Bill Murrays case  began a long process of ultimate salvation. He loathes this day with a  passion due to his egotistic and selfish personality, and the very idea of  him presenting an open air weather forcast, orchestrated not by himself but  by a Groundhog (due to annual tradition, if the groundhog sees a shadow  then the area is supposed to have 5 more weeks of winter, if the groundhog  sees no shadow, spring sets it), is enough to make him curl up and die. If  this isn't bad enough for Bill, he wakes up at 6:00am the following morning  to the horrific realisation that he is &quot;reliving the same day over and  over and over again&quot;. <p>Each day brings about some sort of change  within his character, and Bill evolves into quite an interesting character  by the time the film is through. The mere thought of re-living the same day  again and again goes through many people's minds, and the writer of this  film didn't fail to amuse on this popular fantasy<p>Watch it and see how  funny yet touchingly romantic and sermon like the storyline manages to be.  Excelent choice for those of you who like comedy !

 | product/productId: 5559693782 | review/userId: AR2DE47VCY1C8 | review/summary: Pushing Hollywood's anti-gun agenda | review/text: The whole purpose of this film is to push Hollywood's anti-gun agenda.  The film is well-acted, but the message, which is its only reason for existence, is to attack the firearms industry.  The industry is made out to be wealthy, and is using a corrupt jury expert (Gene Hackman) to blackmail and otherwise get control of the jury, which is, of course, a crime.<br /><br />The hero (Dustin Hoffman) is trying to win a lawsuit against a firearms company, accused of selling "assault weapons" to the criminal element, so that the widow of a young broker who was killed by a disgruntled former employee, can benefit with a multi-million dollar settlement.<br /><br />The evil Hackman, and also the upstanding Hoffman, are approached by a couple of young people who are offering, for $10 million, to swing the jury for them.  Hoffman, being an  honorable, law-abiding lawyer, refuses.  But the evil minion of the firearms industry (Hackman) agrees, of course, since he will stoop to anything.<br /><br />Problems with the story: Every semi-automatic firearm is depicted as an "assault" weapon.  In fact, an actual assault weapon, as defined by the military, is capable of full automatic fire, as well as burst, and semi-automatic fire.  To own such a firearm, United States law requires a $200 license and an investigation of the licensee's character and past history.  Such a legally owned firearm has never been used in a crime in the United States.<br /><br />Nor is the firearms industry composed of "fat cats."  Indeed, many of the companies have been driven into bankruptcy, and the remaining ones--famous manufacturers of some of our most historic firearms, like Colt and Smith & Wesson--have nearly been destroyed defending themselves against greedy lawyers, class action suits, and frivolous lawsuits brought by government bodies.  Left-wing Hollywood is fomenting such efforts.<br /><br />Also ignored is that Second Amendment to the United Statesd Constitution, which permits all citizens to own and carry firearms.  The story line would penalize that right, illegally punishing the constitututionally protected firearms industry for selling perfectly legal devices designed for self-defense that function exactly as advertised, in good working order, because they were used for illegal purposes over which the manufacturer has no control.<br /><br />Like sueing General Motors because one of its products, in good working order, was used in a hit-and-run, or as a getaway car in a bank robbery.<br /><br />The firearms industry has, indeed, been sued a number of times by firearms haters.  They have never won such a case, however,  for the above reasons.  They continue to try, however, and it has cost the industry substantial amounts to protect itself from such frivolous lawsuits.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Hollywood is heavily populated with people, including many top actors, who claim to hate firearms, and would like to disarm the United States' population.  Yet, it is a rare film that does not depict firearms violence by these very people, along with reckless driving episodes endangering the public--the obligatory car chase.  They ca't seem to make a film without such elements.  In this film, the figures given arguing that the deaths by gun violence are 30,000 a year, are grossly inflated and are pure Hollywood propaganda, and of course the National Rifle Association is singled out and comes in for its share of abuse.  You would never know that it was praised by the Presidents of the United States after both World Wars for its patriotic endeavors, and had as its president three Congressional Medal of Honor holders; not exacrly a subversive organization!<br /><br />So, I am giving this film only one star, strictly on account of the propaganda and the agenda driven story.  The acting was certainly adequate, and the direction was not at fault.  But propaganda films do not rate higher, with me at least.  I was blind-sided.  I would never have bought the film had I known what they were pushing.  I'm sorry I did.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other books

I was thrilled when I realized I could buy it on DVD.  I have the old VHS tape version somewhere.<br /><br />This follows the story of a cast of an old Sci-Fi (very "Star Trek"-ish) show that are still going to conventions.  There's a race of aliens who watch the show and think that it's real.  They imploy the help of the cast of the show, having built everything about their culture around it, in order to save their race.<br /><br />The cast has to come together, putting aside all differences, and try to tackle the situation at hand.  They also end up with a better understanding of what had come between their relationships over the last so many decades and also how to better respect their fanbase.

 | product/productId: 0394830741 | review/userId: A1UOXK5WRLAU6H | review/summary: Like a book on tape, except its a video. | review/text: As some negative reviews exclaim, "Dr. Seuss's ABC" is just like reading the book.  It's the exact pictures (given some minor animation), and verbatim words from the books.  If your kid is used to watching vivid animation or violent cop drama or the like, this may not hold his attention. My son finds it soothing and does pay attention to all three stories.  He is 2.5 years old and this video has helped him learn to sing the ABC song.  It may not be as nice as you reading the books to your kids, but when its time to do the cooking/laundry/dishes, you could do a lot worse than putting this 1/2 hour show on for them.
 | product/productId: 0767023765 | review/userId: A3DPLF1J3ILMTO | review/summary: Poorly researched; poorly cast | review/text: I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.<br /><br />One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: "how many killed?" "None" (correct). "How many wounded?"  "none". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think.
 | product/productId: 0767811100 | review/userId: A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK | review/summary: Clever and Humorous Personality Study | review/text: When Hollywood gets it right, they get it really right.  Such is the case with this movie, which combines excellent talent with a winning script.  This movie is a character study as is the Jack Nicholson film "About Schmidt," but the latter was too serious and had too much art to be a fraction as entertaining as "As Good As It Gets."<p>Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obsessive-compulsive writer who lives a nearly reclusive life in his apartment.  In addition to being obsessive-compulsive, he is also a bigot and his acerbic personality wins him no friends and many people who would rather not see him.  Jack Nicholson was perfect for this role, bringing elements of characters we've seen him play in films that range from "The Shining" to "The Witches of Eastwick."<p>Several additional characters are introduced to fully explain Melvin's personality and how his personality changes throughout the course of the movie.  Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) is a homosexual artist with significant psychological baggage of his own.  Simon has a small dog that is used to exploit a crack in Marvin's personality.  Simon also ultimately is the recipient of one of two compliments from Marvin that show how much Marvin changes in the course of the film.  Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) is the only waitress that will serve Marvin at the restaurant that he goes to every day.  Carol has a son who has asthma and allergies and is constantly sick.  Carol has little money and her entire life is focused on her son.  Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is standout as Simon's agent and friend.  There are dozens of other roles that support these characters with a wondrous complexity that generates the pathos, beauty and ultimately good feelings at the end of the movie.<p>(...)It's easy to pick out the flaws with this movie.  However, pass the flaws by to look at the beauty of the characters and how they interact and evolve in the course of the movie.  These actors are very good at their art and the astute viewer will fall in love with them and be left at the end of the movie feeling as though they have had a wonderful experience, without the director ever having had to result to maudlin sentiment to manipulate the viewer's feelings.  This heavily awarded movie is well worth having in a library of classics and worth watching again and again.

Coolio's hit song on the soundtrack "C U When U Get There" completes the atmosphere and lifts the movie into gem status from the mid 90's. Nothing to Lose is a work of art.

 | product/productId: 5559693782 | review/userId: A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ | review/summary: an enjoyable two hours, nothing more | review/text: Runaway Jury is a well made film.  Not a classic by any means, but it held my interest for more than two hours, and these days, that is something special.  So many movies forget that the first job is to get us interested in the characters and their personalities before introducing us to the plot twists.<p>This film solves a lot of potential problems by giving us an all star cast to watch.  The film is another Grisham novel, involving a huge lawsuit against the gun manufacturers (in the book, it's a tobacco company) for marketing a product they know is harmful, nevermind that people have the choice not to use it.  Dustin Hoffman plays the plaintiff attorney, Gene Hackman is a "jury expert" who is hired to put together a jury which will deliver a verdict in the defendent's favor.  John Cusack and Rachel Weisz are lovers who work from the inside, once Cusack gets on the jury.<p>Cusack is the real key to the whole plot, as both sides are really unsure what his motivations are.  By the time everything is clear, one of the sides will have made a huge mistake.  In the meantime, we have a great time watching these actors work through the details.  Not a classic by any means, but lots of fun none the less.

 | product/productId: 0792846397 | review/userId: A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z | review/summary: The Forest Lives and Breathes | review/text: John Boorman's 1985 film about the clash of nature-devouring industrialism against tribalism's harmonious balance with nature in the Amazon forest.  The film has an interesting plot arrangement to deliver its theme of veneration for nature and the impersonal advancement of industry.<br /><br />The film focuses on an American engineer (Powers Boothe) working on a dam project in the Amazon whose son (Charlie Boorman: the young Mordred in 'Excalibur') disappears into the still everpresent jungle.  The young son is taken by Amazon natives and is completely assimilated into their tribal culture.  Many years pass and the child is finally reunited with his family but he now speaks to his father as a man as to the devastation the dam will bring to his adoptive peoples.  The father now told of the travesty of the project must make a choice of conscience.<br /><br />This was a rather touching film with good acting and excellent cinematography.  Some of the pacing and plot development encounters certain obstacles but nothing major.  This film is a must for Boorman fans and I would strongly recommend it to those who are not too familiar with Boorman's works such as 'Excalibur', 'Zardoz', and 'Deliverance' for example.
 | product/productId: 630236325X | review/userId: ADS5APY1NKTL4 | review/summary: one of the best movies/musicals of all time! | review/text: "Singin' In the Rain" and the scene with Gene Kelly splashing around, singing the title song, are on many top ten lists for film, and this film is definitely on my list, as well, and with good reason.  I really do think that this movie (filmed in 1950) was truly ahead of its time, and had the spark, the intelligence, the biting wit, the terrific score, the fabulous dance numbers, and the stellar cast that remains timeless today.<br /><br />"Singin' in the Rain" takes a behind-the-scenes look at the silent film stars of the Roaring Twenties cinema, whose careers were put in possible jeopardy when "talking pictures" were first introduced.  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a handsome, charismatic and talented Vaudvilian performer who took a leap into silent film.  His career as a man who spends film after film miming, overacting and mouthing romantic and heroic words behind a film score background are in trouble when a "talking picture" demo is presented at a Hollywood party.  His leading lady (Jean Hagan) happens to have a terrible voice that could never be transferrable to sound photos, no matter how beautiful she is.  Don also meets beautiful Kathy Seldon (nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds), a young woman and aspiring dancer who hesitates to admit her adoring love for him as an avid fan of his films.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many priceless scenes are in this film.  The humor is warm, genuine and very, very funny.  The musical numbers are first rate.  The "Make 'Em Laugh" number with co-star Donald O'Connor is physical comedy and agility at its best.  He was a brilliant dancer and comic.  If I listed all of the dance and singing numbers, I would need more room!  Please view this film with family, friends or anyone you know who enjoys comedy, music, dancing, and entertainment at its best.

It's almost like the difference between jokes an 8 year old tells and the jokes you hear later on in adulthood(This being the 8 year olds jokes). I feel like I was mislead by the 4 and a half star rating. If you are looking for something that is not very funny this is for you!

 | product/productId: 0767812158 | review/userId: A5FAQGZ0QTZ8L | review/summary: Incorporate This Film Into Your Collection | review/text: Okay, I'm highly biased.  This is my favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />It's a moody movie, set in the South, where emotion and dialogue carry me (and probably you) to the end.  It's so good that, for me, it has become "peanut butter fiction," as if it's always been a part of my life.  When there's nothing else to watch, I'll put it in.  And I'll wonder why I waited so long to watch Sex, Lies, and Videotape again.<br /><br />I've spent some time trying to identify the protagonist of this film.  As with many great films, our hero is not clear.  We have Ann (played by Andie MacDowell), the popular southern girl who, about a year ago, married a promising lawyer, John (Peter Gallagher), recently made junior partner of his firm.  John is secretly sleeping with Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo), Ann's sister.  This situation would have gone on indefinitely, were it not for the arrival of Graham (James Spader).  Graham is John's old buddy who is moving back to town and, with John's permission, will be staying at John and Ann's upscale home.  Although logically Graham should turn out to be just like John--a deceitful man--we quickly discover that the opposite is True.  "True" with a capital T.<br /><br />Graham has changed since the old days.  He's artsy, mysterious, immediately strange and likeable, and Truthful.  John doesn't know what to make of him.  The dialogue in this movie is perfectly revealing, for instance, when Graham explains how he insists on having a car.  John finds a need for a car humorous: "In case you have to leave someplace in a hurry."  Graham counteracts this observation by adding, "Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry."  The first response indicates guilt, the second determination.  Graham has come back to town for a reason.<br /><br />John sends Ann apartment hunting with Graham, which provides John the perfect opportunity to have sex with Cynthia in the marital house while they are away.  Unbeknownst to him, Ann and Graham share a connection.  So we have either Ann or Graham as our "hero."  Ann subconsciously suspects infidelity, and Graham has come to town to show "someone" that he has changed--and we the audience come to realize that he is specifically NOT being John, although years ago he and John were probably exactly alike.  Graham is specifically not a liar.  He is also impotent.<br /><br />Sorry if you feel I'm forcing "spoilers" upon your eyes.  I could give a treatment of this entire movie and still make it worth watching.  So far, the only thing I've left out of Sex, Lies, and Videotape is the videotape.  Graham may not be able to have sex with another person, but he can "get off."  He makes videotapes.  He videotapes women talking about sex, and if you were to ask him if this is how he achieves sexual satisfaction, he'd say matter-of-factly Yes.  He sits in the living room of the apartment that Ann helped him find watching women talk about their sexual experiences.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie would have fizzled at this point, with Graham out of the marital home, but for the sexually oriented Cynthia who hears about Graham and his strange habits.  Once Cynthia visits Graham in his personal space, the conflict of the movie becomes intereseting.  This is a movie with few, if any, visual effects.  O Trust me when I say you don't need them.  The story is enough.<br /><br />How will John react to Cynthia visiting his ex-best friend?  How will John react to Ann, who is slowly becoming wise?  How will John react to the fact that Graham is the center of attention?  Until Graham's arrival, John lived in a perfect world.<br /><br />If you press me, I'll say the protagonist of this story is Ann, because the outcome of events MOST affects her, and she is likeable.  At first I thought the protagonist was Graham.  There is a part of me that considers that John is the most affected by the plotline, because his perfect situation is in danger of falling like sand out of the palms of his grubby hands.  In any work of fiction, he whom is MOST changed by story events is our hero.  You'll have to decide that for yourself.<br /><br />I consider Sex, Lies, and Videotape to be "peanut butter" cinema.  It's so good that you accept it as such; it's a staple of your refrigerator--er--your DVD shelf.  It will wait to be seen, yearly, like Bob Clark's A Christmas Story.  You can't watch it daily, but you'll want to.  You can put it in your DVD player and do other things, occasionally tuning in for great dialogue and masterful plotting.  But that's only after you've watched it too many times.  The first time, you'll wonder why there aren't more movies like this.  You'll wish you were a screenwriter.  You might even sit down at a blank First Draft document.  You might wonder why you can't make the words come, and when they do come, you wonder why you're such a plagiarist.  Why didn't you write Sex, Lies, and Videotape first?
 | product/productId: 6300147959 | review/userId: A1JZD8ZCS3AC1R | review/summary: Pass... | review/text: I'm not a harsh movie critic at all.  And I love movies from the 80s and early 90s (Medicine Man, Point of no return, Labyrinth)  I tend to like a lot of different movies that others don't.  But after 45 minutes of watching this one, I had to turn it off.  I was bored and thought that watching something else that I know I will like and have seen before would be a better idea.  The acting was ridiculous.  The cinemetography was mediocre.  The main star of the film was the location - not the characters.  That's the only enticing aspect of it.  There's no legacy or classiness in this film where there should be as the story is compelling, yet its execution was poor.  I would love to see this movie re-done, with better quality cast and a waaaaaaaaay better script (some of the actions of the indigenous peoples were completely confusing and not easily understood to their relevance to the story).  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.

Each time, I keep hoping it will be better than the last. I think this movie is a cheap (even though it cost more) ripoff of Bloodsport. I think they just wanted another Bloodsport since that one did so well. Van Damme is a little too self-congratulory. The relationship is fairly unbelievable. And that part at the end when Kurt is angry with his girl (cant remember her name), demanding the truth that she was raped and beaten by TongPo (his nemesis), instead of consoling her. She decided not to tell him because she doesnt want to disturb his concentration, but instead starts crying and begging forgiveness for her inexcusable behavoir. You can tell they filmed it that way to get the &quot;the girl has done him wrong too&quot; feeling going. Ugh...

It is the definitive (so far) biography of John's life and his music and is one of the best music biographies ever shown on the big screen.<br /><br />I have this on laserdisc and have been waiting for the re-release on DVD for a long time. I also have "Gimme Some Truth- The Making Of Imagine" and every other official John Lennon DVD.<br /><br />But this one is the first biographical film about just John (not The Beatles) that was released on the big screen.

And being able to see it available online was pure bliss. I bought it immediately, then converted it to DVD, but quickly realized that it is not the whole series. This is only a small portion of all the Jumanji episodes. If I ever find a bulk lot with all episodes, I will buy that too! Overall, Great product and I would recommend to anyone who wants to broaden their child's mind and give them critical thinking skills. This cartoon gives the mind a sense of adventure, puzzle solving and a never ending spirit of not giving up. Although the storyline is in an imaginary land with imaginary creatures and tribes, it is so well put together, it could pass very well to be an alternate dimension somewhere else or a portal to a different planet.
 | product/productId: 0780619714 | review/userId: A2Z1B15F3Y8YU8 | review/summary: An incredibly fun ride with no real "merit" to it. | review/text: Mortal Kombat is one of my favorite film adaptations of a video game.  It catches the feel of the Mortal Kombat game franchise quite well in terms of translating it to the film medium; lots of action scenes, not a *huge* emphasis on plot, characters people know and love staying true to what little we get from the "klassic" games.  This is not, by any means, a "good" movie, but it's a fun one.  Acting ranges from sub-par (Goro) to pretty good (Christopher Lambert makes a really fun Raiden).  In the games, Liu Kang was always one of my least favorite characters, due to his overblown Bruce Lee-esque imitation, but this film removes that, preventing him from being annoying.  Almost every recognizable character (Jax is hardly in it, while Kano and Kitana don't fight much) exhibits at least one signature move from the games, including Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Johnny Cage's ball buster, and Sonya Blade's leg grab.  Most moves are presented more realistically (Sub-Zero's freezing move just kills the poor sod he's fighting), but that's the price of the film transition.<br /><br />If you are a fan of either martial arts movies that don't take themselves too seriously, or of Mortal Kombat, I would highly recommend this film.  If you want something closer to the classic Hong Kong martial arts films like Enter the Dragon, you might want to stay away, but you could surprise yourself.<br /><br />Also, stay away from the sequel; it's terrible even by these standards.

 | product/productId: 6300182878 | review/userId: A3OYQ3L7Q6X3F9 | review/summary: Blu-Ray Review | review/text: This is a review of the product, not of the movie itself.<br /><br />Video:<br />The movie has received a wonderful transfer to 1080p, considering that the master is almost 3 decades old at this point.  There is a very noticeable quality increase compared to video of the upscaled DVD.  Mild film grain is visible throughout (especially in the really dark scenes), though not to a distracting level.  Still, the lines are very crisp, with very few digital artifacts noticeable.  The shots that take place outside in the sun (like the beginning sequence with the helicopter) look positively stunning.  Again, considering the age of the source, this is about as good as the movie will ever be capable of looking.<br /><br />Audio:<br />The 5.1 DTS_HD mix is an improvement over the DVD, but still doesn't utilize the rear speakers well enough.  But the subwoofer is used effectively.  So if you only have a 2.1 system or a decent sound bar, you won't be missing much.<br /><br />Extras:<br />Instead of being a standalone extra, the footage from the DVD's 80-minute "Terror Takes Shape" documentary has been chopped up and plays as a PIP feature clumsily integrated into the full length film.  All the footage is still there, but it's not as interesting to watch.  The Carpenter/Russell commentary is still there, as is the theatrical trailer (standard def).

 | product/productId: 6300214710 | review/userId: A3G3GH2321CUZ | review/summary: Duckie! | review/text: Although this is a part of the great John Hughes-Molly Ringwald fascination fest that gave us other 80s Teen Titans Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, the true gems here are the supporting performances by John Cryer and Annie Potts.  Cryer's lip-synch performance is worth the price of admission, as is his conversation with Andie's dad. Potts' never-grown-up record store manager is a great refusal of adulthood.  And don't forget a nice bit by a pre-annoying Andrew "Dice" Clay.<br /><br />What's a John Hughes movie without a legendary soundtrack.  I'm hooked the moment the Psychadelic Furs kick into the title track.  The movie and the soundtrack are a must for any 80s collection.
 | product/productId: 0800133005 | review/userId: A1PATVNYDP9UNA | review/summary: Great for 1971 NYC but not much else | review/text: Other reviews here that say this movie isn't dated are hard to take serious.  All I could think of while watching was how many holes there were in the plot that would never be there even 5 years later.  Martin Balsam uses his real name and place of business when casing the apartment.  They use a dim, alcoholic old-timer to be look-out?  They do everything that will guarantee they will get identified.  Look I know it was 1971 but this is Sydney Lumet lite and I'm sure he was not proud of this.  I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and thinking that all the taping and surveillance was very cool.  Looking at it now it was very amaturish.  Having grown up in NYC it was great to see old ny-St. Anthony's Church downtown.  The building on 91st St which in this day and age would be lived in by multi-billionaires with hi-tech security.  Of course the streets on ny in this movie were deserted (unbelievable).  The use of Garret Morris and his crack  TPA police squad was also a stretch.  This was an enjoyable light movie of it's time that really has dated very badly.  Even the acting  other than Connery and Balsam is not really good.  But...with a post-007 sean and a hot Dyan Cannnon together there is some value in this movie.

This is one of the all-time great comedies; a truly epic comedy.  In it's original form, it is flawless from beginning to end.  Five Stars easily.<p>Unfortunately, this "Special Edition" dvd includes 15+ minutes of scenes.  Not under a "deleted scenes" section, which would have been appropriate and very welcome, but inserted into the movie itself.  To be fair, the extra footage doesn't really hurt the music scenes.  But did we really need to see Elwood at his place of employment?  Did we really need to see where the Blues-mobile is stored when not being driven?  None of the extra footage adds anything to the movie.  In fact, it really ruins the perfect pacing of the regular cut.  <p>I truly hope Universal sees the error of their ways and reissues this film on DVD with the original cut.  They could even make the added footage viewable within the movie, through seamless branching, but for the love of Pete, give us the option!!!

 | product/productId: 0788817000 | review/userId: A3PPXVR5J6U2JD | review/summary: Not a good film, but it never tries to be | review/text: I'm not entirely sure why I rented this movie, but I suspect it's because Bruce Campbell was involved.  The thought of Bruce Campbell and Quentin Tarantino connected to a horror movie is enough to make me plunk down ten bucks to see anything they create in the theater.  Fortunately, this movie went directly to video, so I didn't waste my ten bucks.<br /><br />Bruce isn't really in the film.  He's in a film within a film and he dies early.  Grrr.  If you're a fan of Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, she dies along with him.<br /><br />And what do they die from? Why, bats of course.  Vampire bats, to be precise.  Bats figure as villains in this movie, which is unfortunate as they're not particularly scary and look like bad Halloween decorations most of the time.  Must all bats flop around like two fish connected by a wire hanger?  Don't any of them glide?<br /><br />Anyway, the plot, such as it is, involves four guys planning to rob a bank in Mexico: C.W. the safecracker (Muse Watson), Ray Bob the dimwitted comedic relief (Brett Harrelson), Jesus the muscle (Raymod Cruz), and Buck the Main Character (Robert Patrick). Luther the mastermind (Duane Whitaker) is supposed to meet up with them at some random seedy hotel, but on the way he hits a bat.<br /><br />No not the baseball bat, but a big vampire bat.  He runs over it with his jeep then shoots it with his gun.  Of course, that's a vampire he shot, who eventually bites Luther. Luther decides to go on with the bank heist and keeps his appointment, slowly turning the other members into vampires.<br /><br />"Why would vampires want to rob a bank?" asked Buck of Sheriff Lawson (Bo Hopkins), who was hunting him before they banded together to kill vampires.<br /><br />"I suppose vampires need money too," says Lawson.<br /><br />Vampires in this series are super vulnerable to sunlight.  They can turn into bats at will.  They are invulnerable to most weapons but die if anything pokes through their heart (steel rods, antlers, you name it).  But most hysterical of all, they are terrified of ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A CROSS.<br /><br />I have to restate the ludicrousness of this vulnerability, because at one point one of the vampires is upset by a CROSSBAR.  That is, a naturally occurring series of right angles.  At various moments throughout the movie, characters suddenly remember to make the sign of the cross with whatever their holding.  Apparently, it never strikes anyone that they should just put up their fingers in a cross.  Or their arms.  Or two shoes.<br /><br />Eventually, the Mexican police show up and then the carnage begins.  In between, we have a homage to Reservoir Dogs, Psycho, and Evil Dead.  In fact, the director (Scott Spiegel) takes the Sam-o-cam to new heights.  We get the blood-puddle cam, the inside-a-vampire's-mouth cam, and the ultra rare up-the-phone-cord cam.  When a character cracks a safe, the camera moves around in circles from the dial on the safe's point of view. When a character walks by a moving fan, we see the fan's point of view. Inspired moviemaking at its finest.<br /><br />In the middle of all this is the obligatory solar eclipse, which extends the carnage for another twenty minutes.<br /><br />From Dusk Till Dawn: Texas Blood Money is not a good film, but it never tries to be.  Completely unpretentious, it seeks to add to the direct-to-video horror bin.  In that regard it succeeds admirably.

Produced in 1944 to increase morale, America's first bombing mission over the Japanese main islands was designated a raid more than an actual run. <p>The B-25 Mitchell bomber, a aging and sagging two-engine 1930s aircraft built from 1925 blueprints based on nineteen-teens technology. The Japanese, confident that the United States did not have the range to bomb the main islands, nevertheless manned a picket-line of Aluetian spotter fishing vessels at the 500-mile mark along the entire eastern shore. Modifications made to reduce the B-25's weight by removing armor plating from the cockpit and gunner's stations became most controversial. As well as anger during the training operations when some of the planes' radial-engine cylinders began to show signs of pitting along with sharp reductions in hp. Normal fuel range of the medium bomber was compensated for by a bold launching from the flight deck of the U.S.S. Hornet. This took all of the space of the ship causing not only normal operations to be suspended, but keeping a respectful distance as well. Fuel was carried inside the planes and empty cannisters dumped at waypoints rather than to leave a 'trail of breadcrumbs' back to the raiding fleet.  <p>Forebodingly, this raid of obsolete little bombers took place at a time when the construction plans for the pressurized B-29 Superfortress hemispheric bomber had already been approved foreshadowing events to come.<p>Some crew members died when the landing field in China was found to be enshrouded in fog. Some were blindfolded, tortured, and toured through Japanese cities for newspaper photographers.  <p>/with Spencer Tracey.

But As For The DVD... | review/text: Well, it looks like Universal Pictures gave us one of those 50/50 DVDs. The extras on this single-disc "Collector's Edition" are very satisfying for the Scarface fans, but the transfer makes the movie look dirty when it's not supposed to be.<p>This happens to be a movie that leans towards a sense of style; that 1980s feel is accompanied by a very fitful and pulsating soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder. Most of the sequences in Scarface look high-class because of Tony's wealthy lifestyle, so cleaning up the film of its fuzziness & dirt would give it an even more realistic feel. I mean, imagine watching those scenes in The Babylon Club remastered both in picture and sound for that absorbing experience! It would really make watching the movie into a happening, which is all the better. Also, look at how grainy some other scenes are: "You made a deal for a ... 18 million dollars without checking with me? Are you crazy, Montana? Are you crazy?!" That scene appears to be the most grainy-filmed sequence in the film, and with this DVD transfer, it appears TWICE as grainy. Is that necessary?<p>I can see why most people are ticked off with this "Collector's Edition"...if this DVD edition of Scarface REALLY is a collector, then that would mean ruling out all other versions known since its release, because this one IS a "Collector's Edition".<p>In my opinion, the movie is classic! But as for the DVD, the only thing that makes it a collector's item is the excellent supplemental material.<p>The movie: *****<br />The extras: ****<br />The transfer: Imagine trying to break through a three-layered concrete wall with your head.

Maybe back in the 60's / 70's that seemed okay for young kids to watch - but my four year old started imitating the behavior immediately after the movie.  Maybe when she is older she can watch it.<br /><br />There is also a short boxing match between Lucy and Snoopy that seemed merely designed for Snoopy to hurt Lucy - but that one is less troublesome to me.<br /><br />It is a shame - pretty good movie.

This premise that we will soon be able to dictate our genes and hence will be able to discriminate on genes was also scary as it is now a clear a present possibility as well.  The deleted scene which showed how using this criteria to decide who gets born and who doesn't would have deprived us of Abraham Lincoln, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein etc was also very powerful and really should have been left in the original film.  This was also the first film that introduced me to Jude Law and it showed me just how good an actor he was even way back then.  Being a fan of noir I couldn't help but feel its influence on this film as well.  This blu-ray version is a real treat for fans as it looks great in 1080p and sounds great in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The special feature documentaries are also decent making this to date the definitive version of a great sci-fi film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of one of Universal Studios' most treasured and prestigious films, Psycho will debut for the first time ever on Blu-ray(tm) on October 19, 2010. Fans can now enjoy a superior quality, hi-def experience when viewing this re-mastered classic. Psycho will also be honored during its landmark anniversary by the esteemed 2010 Festival De Cannes. Chosen as a Cannes Classic Selection, the film will be recognized as a restored masterwork from the past.<br /><br />Meticulously restored for perfect digital picture and the purest DTS HD 5.1 digital sound, the Psycho 50th Anniversary Edition takes audiences on a thrilling journey as an unsuspecting victim (Janet Leigh, The Manchurian Candidate, Bye Bye Birdie) visits the Bates Motel and falls prey to one of the silver screen's most notorious psychopaths - Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins, Murder on the Orient Express, Les Miserables). Featuring one of the most iconic scenes in film history - the infamous "shower scene" - Psycho continues to terrify audiences today as much as it did half a century ago.<br /><br />The Psycho 50th Anniversary Edition is packed with extras, including behind-the-scenes bonus features, documentaries, audio interviews and an in-depth look at the re-mastering process. Universal Studios BluWave Audio (Universal's in-house post production sound facility) started the re-mastering process with the film's previously preserved and restored soundtrack to create a new 5.1 mix. BluWave then contracted Audionamix, a Paris-based audio technology company, to split the original mono music source into quasi-orchestral tracks. Audionamix, a leader in soundtrack separation, then applied their breakthrough proprietary technology enabling BluWave to create a discrete 5.1 split music mix.<br /><br />BluWave's creative talent gathered the original sound effects from the Studios' extensive effects library and, using these source materials, created a 5.1 up-mix to bring Psycho's soundtrack up to the expectations of contemporary audiences while maintaining the original integrity of the filmmaker's vision.<br /><br />Psycho's mono audio track will also be available for viewers who want to experience the film in its original form on its golden anniversary. This cinematic achievement from the Master of Suspense is an essential addition to every movie lover's library.<br /><br />Psycho 50th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray(tm) unleashes the power of your HDTV with perfect picture and the purest digital sound available and contains extensive bonus features including:<br /><br />* Psycho Sound: A never-before-seen piece that looks at the re-mastering process required to create a 5.1 mix from the original mono elements using Audionamix technology.<br />* The Making of Psycho: A feature-length documentary on Hitchcock's most shocking film.<br />* In the Master's Shadow - Hitchcock's Legacy: Some of Hollywood's top filmmakers discuss Hitchcock's influence and why his movies continue to thrill audiences.<br />* Hitchcock/Truffaut Interviews: Excerpts from a 1962 audio interview with Alfred Hitchcock.<br />* Audio Commentary: Feature-length audio commentary with Stephen Rebello (Author of "Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho")<br />* Newsreel Footage: The Release of Psycho: Vintage newsreel on the unique policy Alfred Hitchcock insisted upon for the release of the film.<br />* The Shower Scene: A look at the impact of music on the infamous "shower scene."<br />* The Shower Scene: Storyboards by Saul Bass: Original storyboard design.<br />* Production Notes: Read an essay on the making of the film.<br />* The Psycho Archives: See the gallery of on-set photo stills from the film's production.<br />* Posters And Psycho Ads: See a gallery of original posters and ads from the theatrical campaign.<br />* Lobby Cards: View a gallery of promotional lobby cards from the film's theatrical campaign.<br />* Behind-The-Scenes Photographs: View rare photos showing the cast and crew at work.<br />* Theatrical Trailer: Watch the original promotional trailer from the film's theatrical campaign.<br />* Re-Release Trailers: Watch the promotional trailer created for the re-release of the film.

 | product/productId: 0783241305 | review/userId: AK2AQIULQDFS5 | review/summary: Unoriginal, but still tells a Worthy Tale. | review/text: "The Bone Collector" is not an Original film, which is the main reason for it's Critical Lynching, but if you can get past that small fault, there is a lot here to Enjoy. <p>"Silence of the Lambs" meets "Rear Window" is probably the Best way to Summarise this film in a Sentence. It also explains the films Lack of Originality. But in the end, it has a few Jump Scenes, a Couple of Surprises, and Angelina Jolie... Well worth a Viewing.<p>Denzel Washington (lending more Talent to the film than the film deserves) stars a Lincoln Rhyme, an Ex-Forensics' Detective, now a Quadriplegic. When a High Profile Kidnapping occurs, the baffled police bring the evidence around to Lincoln for Analysis. Hesitant at first, Lincoln is soon on board and he wants to recruit the Street cop who attained the Evidence. Angelina Jolie plays the Street cop who Reluctantly joins the hunt for the Killer.<p>The Supporting cast is the Best thing about this film, as having a large Supporting cast provides many Suspects for a Final Twist. Ed O'Neill, Michael Rooker, Luis Guzman, Leland Orser and Queen Latefa all give Wonderful performances and they Really fit their roles. A Brilliant job in Casting.<p>In Conclusion... It's got Ok Twists, Good Scares, Great Performances, and Angelina Jolie... Trust me, its Well worth Purchasing.

In every sense<br />of the word.  Michael Rooker is Henry a psycho-killer<br />who,aided by roommate Towles,videotapes various murders until<br />the friends are pulled apart by Otis's sister. This is a<br />brilliant documentary-style SHOCKER that has BRILLIANT<br />acting from Tom Towles,Tracy Arnold and in a role that<br />like Anthony Perkins 20yrs. prior was made for only<br />him Mr. Michael Rooker! This also has fine Directing,<br />Music(always a PLUS!) and a screenplay full of more<br />heartbreakingly true moments than in a dozen more<br />pretentious "straight" features. Would like to point<br />out that this is really not a movie about the serial<br />killer Henry Lee Lucas. Michael Rooker looks nothing<br />nor acts like the real WEASEL like Lucas. I recommend<br />1987's CONFESSIONS of a SERIAL KILLER. In that movie<br />you have a actor playing Henry Lee Lucas that looks like the<br />135pd Henry. They should have called this movie MICHAEL<br />or something else. For with the exception of names has<br />nothing to do with Henry Lee Lucas. BE WARNED! This movie<br />is 2nd only to Ruggero's cannibal holoCAUST for me on<br />SCARE factor. The 2nd act HOME INVASION scene being<br />video taped from Henry I put right there with The<br />Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw on FRIGHT meter! This is<br />bar-none one of the most unsettling movies you're<br />ever going to see,with GRIM atmosphere that clings<br />to you like moss on a rock!

So many modern  attempts at producing a true film musical have failed.  This one, lead by  talented Frank Oz, succeeds.<p>First, the music is great.  From ballads  (&quot;Somewhere That's Green&quot;) to Motown (all the Girl's Chorus  songs, &quot;Mean Green Mother&quot;) the songs are wonderful.<p>The cast  is top-notch.  Ellen Greene is hilarious, over-the-top, and touching all at  once.  Rick Moranis is a great singer and born to play Seymour.  And the  cameos make this film lively.  Steve Martin's dentist is wickedly  funny.<p>I wish we could get the alternate ending back on this new DVD,  however.  (My one complaint!)

 | product/productId: 0783227264 | review/userId: A2FQWN6Q2ZOSXI | review/summary: No matter the circumstances, no matter the situation.  Faith endures. | review/text: This is a great movie.  Like the Bible, it deals with humanity as it is, not as it is supposed to be.  Christ is perfect.  We Christians are not perfect...at least not yet.  :-)<br /><br />Contrary to what some have said, this movie is a movie that Christians should see.  It portrays the faith in very positive terms.  Not as the hypocritical, legalistic and club-like modern (organized) churches, but as the passionate faith that drives us to struggle against the our own nature as we seek a relationship with our Creator. (Important side note, while Christianity is about individual faith, it will always draw us away from ourselves and into Communion with God and other Christians, and even to our enemies beyond the Church.)<br /><br />There are several scenes that stand out in this movie.  For example, the scene where Sonny praises a clergyman from another faith tradition as having different ways of doing the same job...sharing the good news that Jesus Christ has saved us from ourselves.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the very last one in the movie.  To comment further would give it away.  I just hope that you will watch the movie to see it.  :-)<br /><br />The Christian Faith is passion for the one-and-only God who is our Creator, Savior, and Spiritual Guide.  The Apostle shows this passion.

 | product/productId: 0783241321 | review/userId: A2PBV1899CX3TE | review/summary: There is no real you. Oh yeah, I forgot. | review/text: Man on the Moon is Jim Carrey's homage to comedian/non-comedian Andy Kaufman. A complex man, Kaufman didn't think of himself as a comedian, but he pioneered a bizarre act--as much conceptual art as comedy--oftentimes trying to provoke as much as get laughs. As his manager asked him:<br /><br />George Shapiro: Andy, you have to look inside and ask this question: who are you trying to entertain--the audience or yourself?<br /><br />In the movie George Shapiro is played by Danny Devito, but the real George Shapiro plays Mr. Besserman, who is forced to fire Andy from his comedy club because he isn't funny. He suggests a joke, like: "Why did the Siamese twins move to England? So the other one could drive," but Andy doesn't get it, isn't interested.<br /><br />But Andy creates a character--foreign man--who does get a good reaction from the audience. He begins as a nervous, inept comedian, does a lousy impression of President Carter, and then says he will now do "the Elvis Presley." He rips off velcro strips on his pants, revealing the studs and sequins of "The King's" Las Vegas bell-bottomed jump suit. To a boom box rendition of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" he dons the costume and transforms. His lip curls. He does a great "Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes," then returns to character and nervously thanks the audience. Shapiro ends up managing him, though he is uncertain just where to book him. His break comes when he is cast as Latka Gravas for the sit com Taxi.<br /><br />Andy is loath to do a sit com, but dictates his terms, one of which is that Tony Clifton must appear in 4 episodes. Clifton turns out to be either the worst Vegas lounge act of all time, or an alter ego of Andy Kaufman, in either case, he is thrown off the set of Taxi, along with his entourage of hookers, after inciting a riot, complete with fisticuffs.<br /><br />The movie hits all the high and low points of Kaufman's career: Taxi, Tony Clifton, The Mighty Mouse theme lip synch on SNL, the "fight" on Friday's, The Great Gatsby bit, The intergender wrestling, the "fight" on Letterman, touch my cyst, his interest in Transcendental Meditation, his Carnegie Hall performance, complete with The Rockettes, Santa Claus, and an invitation for the entire audience to have milk and cookies, and finally his death from cancer. Or was that just another prank?<br /><br />Jim Carrey gave a pretty good performance, but overdoes it with the crazy eyes. Kaufman's crazy eyes were just a bit more unsettling. Carrey doesn't have as good a rhythm on the bongos as Kaufman--though his comic timing is impeccable. Jim Carrey has made an entertaining movie, and also let the audience in on the joke, if it was one of Andy's pranks--but that is also the problem. How do you make a movie about a comedian/non-comedian who stretched the whole concept of comedy to include jokes at the expense of his audience? He wasn't always even trying to make the audience laugh. Maybe the joke was just something he and perhaps one or two others could appreciate.<br /><br />Unlike this movie, whose aim is clearly to entertain. Was it then a failure because it strayed from the path pioneered by Kaufman? And what of Andy Kaufman. Was he serious, or was he putting you on? Even as he was dying of cancer, members of his own family think it may be just another prank. To this day there are people who think he faked his own death and will come back to laugh at our gullibility.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141865">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a>: Also directed by Milos Forman, and also featuring Courtney Love.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732181">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>: Also directed by Milos, and featuring Danny Devito.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AFF5">Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Deluxe Edition)</a>: Great Jim Carrey performance in title role.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141687">The Cable Guy (Full Screen)</a>: Great and creepy Jim Carrey performance in title role.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A.

 | product/productId: 078324262X | review/userId: A1Q6R9NL3WA91O | review/summary: Srebrenica Revisited | review/text: This film is a masterpiece!<p>I rented Ride with the Devil last night on the spur of the moment because I saw Ang Lee's name on it. Before, I had never heard of it, but boy was I swept away! How is it possible that Ang Lee - apparently a Taiwanese - is able to create social and historical drama on European and American subjects that by far surpasses that of contemporary Europeans and Americans? Ride With The Devil, The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, Pushing Hands... Jesus, those films are so bloddy brilliant! Especially to me as a Dane, an unwilling bystander to the Balkan fratricide of these last 10 years, the message is unmistakable: It takes so little to start killing your neighbours indiscriminately, so little to reduce individuals to legitimate targets that you can murder for the cause. (And yes, I know that I do Ang Lee's film little justice with these cliches, but that is because I lack words to describe the magnificence of this epic). <p>In short, this is the best film made about the Balkan wars, even though it is set in Missouri.<p>Jrgen, Denmark.

 | product/productId: 0800198433 | review/userId: A1ZR7H9LU80VUC | review/summary: The Original on DVD at last...... | review/text: Following in Lucas's footsteps with his release of the original Star Wars as it was first presented. Spielberg does his sci-fi epic the same way with this excellent release of the 1977 UFO Classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. When it was first released on video back in the early 80's it was the Special Edition version which was released to theaters in 1980 with new end footage with the interiors of the Mother Ship as well as other scenes edited out entirely and replaced with other scenes or alternate versions of other scenes. In fact, the only way to ever see the original was when it aired on TV as a movie and even then the two versions were combined to fill a 3 hour time slot. In the 1990's Laserdisc owners were the first to be able to own the original version thanks to Criterion Collection laserdiscs, except that the end credits were from the 1980 version. Then in 2001, the Collector's edition came out and it was more of a marriage of the two versions as it still eliminated key scenes from the original version, yet restored the original<br />ending.  The Best part of this DVD set is that it pleases everyone. It has the original, complete with restored original 1977 end credits ( for the first time, The Special Edition, and the collector's edition and loads of special features including the extended teaser trailer for the first film, the trailer for the second and the advertising trailer for this ultimate colection edition.  The sound is presented in 5.1 Dolby and DTS format on all 3 discs. If you have the right stereo equipment, you could play the original in its original stereo sound format...but why. I'm all for nostalgia but this is one of those movies where you need to have the subwoofer active, especially at the final scenes where the mother ship blows out the glass in the observation tower. The video quality is also superb. I can only imagine what this film sounds like and looks like on the BLU-RAY version also available and for about the same price as this set through online discount retailers.  A must for any Spieleberg fan.<br />A little bit of trivia regarding both Star Wars and CE3K is that at the time of the release, both directors were reportedly in Hawaii, discussing the possibileity that their indiviual movies would flop  Both films were very succesful. And the projct they were discussing at theat time was another great franchise...the beginnings of what became to be Raiders of the Lost Ark.
 | product/productId: 0790734060 | review/userId: A1NSUJJCG73IRF | review/summary: Amadeus  (1984) | review/text: Director:  Milos Forman<br /><br />Cast:  F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Charles Kay.<br /><br />Running Time:  160 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for some violence, nudity, and language.<br /><br />Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amadeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.  The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says "Ah, how about...?" he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying "Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with an emotionless face "I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.<br /><br />Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constance played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constance is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music.  Like other landmark movies, "Citizen Kane," "Psycho," "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," and "Jaws," "Amadeus" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard; the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.<br /><br />Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constance, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.  That's a good way to describe "Amadeus," as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.<br /><br />Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is, it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism, as "Amadeus" is one of the most beautifully constructed, eloquent films of the last twenty-five years.  Truly exceptional, entertaining, and engrossing even if you aren't a Mozart fan or a devoted fan of music in general.
 | product/productId: 0780637593 | review/userId: ACEA95FQS1AVP | review/summary: Hidden Gem! | review/text: This was a phenomenal movie, unfortunately overlooked by many.  The entire cast gave excellent performances, especially Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen.  Unlike most movies with a character dying of an illness, House does not linger over it--keeping the fact a secret from most characters until the end.  It made the relationship building more believable.  Hayden Christensen floored me with his performance (having only seen him in Star Wars--not exactly a demanding role) as the rebellious, hurting, self-destructive teenager.  He is definitely the best actor of his generation, no exaggeration. Get this movie now--you won't be disappointed!

It's too bad Universal is not releasing other bionic videos, I know there  is a demand for it.  If they do release more, I hope they come with better  artwork for the video covers that will do justice to this classic TV show.
 | product/productId: 6300988805 | review/userId: A2ZHH7AK83JB5G | review/summary: Changed from the book but still worth seeing! | review/text: The characters of Charles Dickens's timeless tale come to life in spellbinding black and white that perfectly captures the book's tone.  Both Estella and Miss Havisham's characters are vastly sweetened from the book.  Estella has genuine affection for Pip instead of just seeing him as another person to manipulate.  Miss Havisham is actually concerned when Estella and Pip fight instead of being happy that her master plan of having Estella break Pip's heart is succeeding.  These changes allow for the overly saccharin ending that is greatly different in tone and plot from either of the two grim endings Dickens actually wrote for the book.

And for only $10.99, Amazon is offering the best deal that can be had.<br /><br />So if you're a fan of this movie and can wipe away the tears of not getting the steelbook case, you'll certainly love this set as it's probably sure to become the most complete release this flick will ever see.
 | product/productId: 0780683048 | review/userId: A1CFIU3IBUH24U | review/summary: Simply the best | review/text: At the age of 25, Orson Welles burst onto the Hollywood scene with this masterpiece. The fact that this film is in black and white and is considered the best ever made unfortunately scares away many from my generation; little do they realize that this was perhaps the most modern film of the period. From its revolutionary (and still awe-inspiring) visual style to its memorable performances, Citizen Kane is a genius accomplishment. Welles, like a sponge, soaked in the qualities of world cinema (primarily European cinema) and used these tools to create a film that is unlike anything before or since. The heartbreaking story of Charles Foster Kane is the embodiment of the American Dream in all its glory and folly, providing a mature and modern outlook on the fallability of man. Surprisingly entertaining (it's actually quite funny), this film says more than the first two Godfather films, and in a third of the time, no less. It is necessary viewing for any film-lover.

 | product/productId: 6301971787 | review/userId: ARY408FHTY9LS | review/summary: Minnelli's priceless masterpiece | review/text: A vivacious and energetic spectacular directed by musical director of Vincente Minnelli. Presented in his, own unique signature style of bright colours, upbeat melodious performances, and original costume designs. Minnelli's signature style of filmmaking enables him to embrace the ambience of each interrogational dance routine along with characters emotions.<br />Starring MGM heavyweight, Judy Garland alongside MGM's next rising star chorographer/dancer, Gene Kelly. Together their onscreen chemistry is brilliant and attractive where Kelly plays a wise-cracking vagabond  who masquerades himself as the notorious pirate, Mack The Black in order to win the heart of his latest flame, (Garland).  With hellcat hilarity, audacious stunts and romance, ill mostly remember this film as not only Gene Kelly's boost to stardom, but for the excellent onscreen team between Kelly and Garland.

 | product/productId: 6302291879 | review/userId: ACTYP447JCDX0 | review/summary: The jewel in the Coen's crown... | review/text: "Barton Fink" represented something of a departure for the Coen brothers.  They had always reveled in absurdism, but here they went for full-on surrealism.  This style was also evident in the later "The Man Who Wasn't There," and even "O Brother, Where Art Thou" to a certain extent, but "Fink" remains unequaled for its sheer strangeness.  There are moments here that rival even David Lynch in cinema as out-of-body-experience, but the Coens always stay in firm control of their universe (this is not a knock on Lynch; his pictures are all about the surrender of control to inexplicable events).<br /><br />The film begins in a relatively realistic, even subdued manner.  We witness the ending of playwright Barton Fink's (John Turturro in a somewhat Eraserhead-esque coif) latest creation, an allegedly social-realist drama about working-class Jews on the lower east side of Manhattan.  Since the play (and of course the movie) takes place just before the U.S. would enter WWII, this would lead some to draw a comparison to Clifford Odets, an actual playwright of the era, but the connection I think is meant to be facile, like the "real" characters that would pop up in "O Brother."  Fink is no mere Odets-manque, but a conflation of all artists whose reach exceeds their grasp.  In short order, Fink learns he is to be summoned to Hollywood, the least social-realist place on earth, where he is given an assignment to write, of all things, a Wallace Beery wrestling picture, a subject which Fink, needless to say, knows nothing about.  The performance of Michael Lerner, as studio cheif Jack Lipnick, is a force of nature, rivaled only by John Goodman as Fink's seemingly ordinary next door neighbor Charlie Meadows, who agrees to help Fink with the severe writer's block he has developed.<br /><br />The hotel where Fink and Charlie live should be considered the real star turn in a movie with nothing but great performances.  An art deco nightmare with perpetually peeling wallpaper and endless hallways, it could be an even more garish cousin to Kubrick's Overlook hotel from "The Shining."  This place, however, is haunted only by its residents, one of whom is trapped in his own head.  That would be Barton, who is almost completely unable to relate to others because of constant self absorbtion.  His quest to tell the story of "the common man" is seen as pathetic throughout the movie, but as it goes on, it reaches dangerous levels.  Soon enough, reality itself starts to bend and distort, until...well, you'll just have to see for yourself.  Trust me, you will never predict what happens.<br /><br />"Barton Fink" makes many references to heads and their respective contents, and who has possession of them at various times.  The hotel itself is a kind of gigantic head, but what is it thinking about?  By the movies end, we get an idea of what it's dreaming about, and it's summed up when one character, running down an infinite hallway and holding a shotgun in each hand, screams "I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!  I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!"  Or, to quote Sartre, "hell is other people."  Hell, indeed.<br /><br />I suppose one could also read "Barton Fink" as an allegory about Jews in America.  Not from a religious viewpoint, although one highly surreal scene involving the Old Testament could be cited, but more culturally.  In the early part of the twentieth cen-<br /><br />tury, the Jews were strangers in a strange land, who found a way to become part of the culture by inventing it, in plays and movies.  There were of course many who said they were just "out of touch" with the American people, an accusation cultural conservatives use to this day, even as actual "Jewish influence" on the culture seems to be waning.<br /><br />To this day , I don't think the Coens have produced a more personal statement, although they continue to make great films (okay, maybe not "Intolerable Cruely").  Even though the current DVD edition is somewhat bare-bones, "Barton Fink" remains an essential item for a thoughtful movie fan.

Wild Bill fans know one of his trademarks was wearing his pistols backwards butts front in his holsters, when he drew he would draw in the normal way flipping the guns around with a twist of his wrist, this was different from other B-Western heroes of that day ... don't miss any of the Wild Bill Elliott features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his B-Western adventures.<br /><br />Under Joe Kane (Director / Producer), Ralph Spence (Short Story Author), Michael H.

Copeland's book on "Bill Elliott:The Peaceable Man" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action. My personal favorites were the "Red Ryder Series" or "The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok" an ongoing character that would appear in many films to come...as Hickok and Wild Bill Saunders. Elliott was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were the caliber of Buck Jones, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele...good reading for all you wranglers out there...I found myself being transported back in time, Mr. Copeland's book has opened my eyes to what a wonderful unselfish person Bill Elliott was...only wish I could have met him. He was one of a kind...a peaceable man!...published by Empire Publising and available on Amazon and Empire Publications Inc ... it's no small wonder that William Elliott's name was at the top of the list, working with the top directors of the day Howard P.

The film itself is not bad, but it is not brilliant, with some good moments but also with a lot, perhaps unintended movie clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray has a decent picture but it seems that the original film elements could not cater for more.

 | product/productId: 6301971140 | review/userId: A29VKODW4R5U7W | review/summary: Riveting production of Shakespeare's Great Roman Tragedy... Fine DVD transfer from Warner | review/text: This is a thoroughly riveting production of Shakespeare's tragedy. It boasts a stellar cast and excellent production values. I found it strange that it is touted as a Marlon Brando film when Brando doesn't actually play the central role. That honour belongs to James Mason who provides a brilliant portrait of the tormented Brutus, the one truly noble man in this whole sad affair. Sir John Gielgud is also outstanding as the envious, conniving but weak Cassius. Brando's performance, great as it is, should be seen in the context of the equally great performances of those around him. In Robert Osborne's introduction, we are told how Brando sought Gielgud's help in preparing for his role; recording Gielgud's delivery of Antony's lines, and assiduously listening to and studying from them. The final effect is electrifying. This is not the boring Shakespeare dreaded by schoolkids the world over. This is gripping, searing stuff that, as Laurence Fishburne says in the accompanying documentary, made Shakespeare "the Aaron Spelling of his day." The one sore spot was Louis Calhern's Caesar who looks more like Hollywood's caricature of a Roman Patrician than Shakespeare's intended character. But that's a minor quibble for Caesar is really just a minor figure, even though the play does bear his name.<br /><br />I was delighted by the reviewer who pointed out the interpretational possibilities regarding Brutus' character and motivations. However I disagree with him when he says that the film failed in its depiction of Brutus. The reviewer's preference for a darker, more self-aware Brutus is fascinating to explore but this is a Hollywood film from the early 1950s and we should see it in that context. The beauty of Shakespeare is that it can be interpreted in so many different ways. However, in the end, it is the producer who has to decide how he wants to depict the character on stage. The producers in this case, chose this particular interpretation; a relatively straightforward, clearcut view of Brutus; that of the essentially good, noble, but naive hero. It is as valid an interpretation as the one proposed by the reviewer. I agree that the darker view could make the film even more fascinating to watch. But it does not mean that the present interpretation is a failure. It is a perfectly valid interpretation in an altogther fine film. If this wonderful production can spark interest in viewers to find out more and to question further the original play, then it will have done far more than anyone could hope for.<br /><br />Warner has finally made this classic film available on DVD in a fine transfer preserving its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio (Full Screen). The B&W print looks largely excellent, with very good contrast and excellent grey shading. There are a few segments where flutters of dirt and nicks suddenly appear but they are thankfully rare. Film grain is visible throughout but is never obtrusive. The original Mono sound has been remastered to give a very creditable sounding DD 5.1 track. Speech is crystal clear and largely front-centered. Strangely there is also a French language track. It was bizarre listening to Shakespeare in French. Optional English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles are included. There is a fine 20-minute documentary "The Rise of Two Legends," on Brando's role in this and other films. There are also trailers for 4 of the 5 films being released as part of the Marlon Brando Collection. If this interests you, you might want to consider getting the entire boxed-set because there is a substantial difference in price and quite some savings to be made.

Anyway, one of the absolute best things about this movie is the soundtrack.  You have Harry Connick, Jr. and Jimmy Durante, among several others, singing those timeless songs they just don't sing anymore.<br /><br />I'm a romantic big time, and there's just something about a love story with Nat King Cole singing "Stardust" at just the right moment to make a big marshmallow out of me.

I saw this film years ago on TV, and now I'm glad I waited to buy any copy of it.<br />Picture: Top-notch. For epic landscapes, this movie is to the West what Lawrence of Arabia is to the Middle East, and the transfer for this DVD is beautiful, doing full justice to Winton Hoch's cinematography. Always sharp; doesn't look bad at all.<br />Sound: Excellent as well.<br />Special features: Adequate, but as I've said before, I didn't buy the DVD for the features--the picture-quality and sound are what really sell this edition.<br />This is the kind of treatment Warner Brothers needs to give to some of its other great old films, especially the ones sitting in vaults right now, like Sergeant York, or those that still haven't had a good outing on DVD, like some of John Wayne's other films. If you've been waiting for a good home entertainment copy of The Searchers to come around, this is it.

 | product/productId: 0767830997 | review/userId: A2YQ5O6XV23543 | review/summary: A great sleazy film but the unrated version is a bust overall. | review/text: My review will pertain just to the extended "unrated" version of Wild Things.<br /><br />People purchasing the unrated DVD of the  1st (and great) Wild Thing film hoping to see a substansial amount of extra sex and nudity are likely to be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Despite the label stating that this is "the unrated version too hot for theaters", it appears to be more of an initial cut of the film containing material that was left out of the final theatrical cut for good reason.<br /><br />Most of the extra footage is just little dialogue bits here and there that state stuff a bit more obviously then what was given to the viewer the 1st time through in theaters.<br /><br />There's also sort of an alternate part added to the ending that just makes no sense whatsoever as well regarding a potential genetic relation between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell's characters which would have added an incestuous angle to their lesbian relationship.<br /><br />The only addition that I think really should've stayed in the movie is a admittedly nice extension to the makeout section in the pool featuring Neve and Denise. We now get to see Neve remove Denise's bikini top revealing her stupendous & breathtaking breasts with some very nice added kissing between the two hot actresses,<br /><br />Since the film was kind of a tongue in cheek sendup of sleazy movies of this nature and didn't have a problem wallowing in said sleaziness, I don't know why the filmmakers cut this part out.<br /><br />What I recommend doing is just holding onto the original R rated theatrical cut DVD (especially since the unrated DVD doesn't carry over the nice commentary track from the 1st release) and if you're a massive fan of the movie, pick up the unrated cut and get a DVD case that holds a DVD on each side.  Then, just make your own 2 pack of the film this way as the unrated cut has some nice but pointless additions (like see Denise Richards washing her truck in very skimpy clothing) that hurt the flow of the movie but are worth having for the diehard fans of the film.<br /><br />Just don't get rid of your original DVD like I mentioned.<br /><br />A great, sexy and sleazy film nonetheless, but the unrated DVD is a complete wasted oppurtunity IMO.
 | product/productId: 6301103491 | review/userId: AL1XGMQHKBQPV | review/summary: Don't judge a book (video) by it's cover | review/text: Back in the early 90's I've seen Sleepaway Camp on the shelves at the local video store. It looked like a typical Friday the 13th slasher knockoff, a genre which I was tired of, a killer stalking kids at a summercamp? Not too original, guys. I was more into the Nightmare on Elm Street and Hellraiser, films that were more rooted into the supernatural. So with a stick up my butt, I passed. In the recent months I've been buying up dvd's of horror and exploitation films I've heard of or neglected to see. Well, Sleepaway Camp was on the list, so with an open mind and some low (very low) expectations, I gave it a look. I'm still kicking myself for being so ignorant. Sleepaway Camp is a good if not underated, horror film with a great shock ending. I wouldn't rank it up with the films of Hitchcock, De Palma, or Argento, but it definitly deserves an honorable mention. The image of Angela at the closing of the film will stay with you for a awhile. Aside from that it is a low budget affair with some campy acting, but I was expecting that and actually enjoyed it. The filmwork itself was of a better quality than I expected. Anyone wanting to explore the genre of the 80's slasher film, this a must see!

To me, they are the cornerstone of what a good adventure movie should be.  Suspenseful, humorous, exiting.  Great characters that touch your heart, raise your spirits and fire your blood.  What more can you ask for?<br /><br />I don't know if I should be the one to recap the trilogy.  As I'm sure many others have done, far better than I can.  But, on the off chance no one has, I'll give it a go.<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK<br /><br />We meet the daring and intrepid archaeologist and adventurer, Indiana Jones, who is on the hunt for the legendary, Ark of the Covenant.  Jones must find the lost Ark before the Nazi's do.  Aided by ex-flame, Marion and site digger, Sallah, Jones manages to find the Ark, but not before the Nazi's find him.  It then becomes a game of keep-away between Jones and Belloq (rival archaeologist and Nazi tool).  Can Jones keep the Ark AND the girl?  Both of which he loses more than once.  Jones must brave fire, poison, a snake infested Egyptian tomb and a host of meddling Nazi's.  Will this adventure prove too daring for our hero?  (Since there are two more movies, it obviously doesn't.)  Will he recover the Ark?  And, more importantly, will he get the girl?<br /><br />THE TEMPLE OF DOOM<br /><br />This movie starts off with a bang.  After barely surviving poisoning, a nightclub brawl and a high-speed car chase through the streets of Shanghai, Indy is marooned in the jungles of India, along with pint-sized sidekick, Short Round and nightclub singer, Willie Scott (who proves to be more of a hindrance than a help).  They unwittingly stumble upon an ancient and evil cult that has enslaved the children of a local village.  Indy must free the children and brake the stronghold that the cult has in the area, without becoming a slave himself.<br /><br />Minor note.  Though this is the second installment in the trilogy, if you look at the dates given in the beginning of both Raiders and Temple of Doom, you'll notice that the Temple of Doom adventure preceded Raiders by a year.  That hardly matters in the grand scheme of things.  I just like pointing that out.<br /><br />THE LAST CRUSADE<br /><br />Indy's father has disappeared while on a quest for the Holy Grail.  A lifelong pursuit that has driven he and Indy apart.  Indy takes on the Grail search in an attempt to find clues leading to his fathers whereabouts.  Along the way he is lead to an Austrian castle where the Nazi's are holding Papa Jones in the hopes of finding the location of the Grail.  (CHEATERS!!!)  Indy and his father escape from the castle within an inch of their lives.  Now, they must elude capture while trying to make their way out of the country and head off the Germans before they can find the Grail.  Indy and his father must brave rat infested catacombs, German flying aces, a murderous tank and finally, a test of faith that will either lead them to the Grail or be the end of the Jones boys.<br /><br />I like these movies.  They're fun, adventuresome and entertaining.  Each movie stands on it's own. They just work.  The thing I like most about this box set is the fourth disc that contains bonus material for all three movies.  It shows you how they made each movie, what went into creating the character of Indiana Jones and the world he lives in.  Exciting!<br /><br />I think anyone would be pleased with this set.  There aren't three better movies out there.

For those of you looking for more anti-Barbra ammunition (too young for the role, too self-absorbed, etc.), consider that this was only her SECOND ever film and the one production she's shared with an extremely large cast. (And I personally don't hold Ms. Streisand's politics against her, even if so many, many, MANY others do.) The film is also one of the truest examples of a lavish movie musical, and it soars *because* of its fibre-optic thin plot of likable New Yorkers being romantically matched all over Yonkers just before the turn of the century. There are musical soliloquies from everyone-- from Streisand, Walter Matthau, clerks Michael Crawford and Danny Locklin, to hat mistress Marianne McAndrew, and dance turns with Locklin, E. J. Peaker, and the ridiculously gangly Tommy Tune. There's something for everyone in this very sweet, comic, tuneful film-- even jazz great Louis Armstrong!! Streisand is quite good as a 19th-century yenta, and even shows pathos in the film's softer moments like the "Parade" number (quietly speaking to the locket pic of her deceased), and my personal favorite, "Love Is Only Love-" staged through a bedroom window, showing Ms. Streisand unusually vulnerable, hair down and in a dressing gown- but incredibly beautiful. Thank God it's on DVD, in all of its Todd-AO, widescreen glory.
 | product/productId: 0780631153 | review/userId: A3H6FNPU0JHXZM | review/summary: blah | review/text: Although the Hollywood critics may laud this movie, it is way too disjointed to be enjoyed without watching it several times.  I'm guessing.  I don't have the strength to watch it again.  The previews made it look like such a good movie...even the previews tho, have a more consistently flowing plot than the movie itself.  With so many characters [all of whom use inappropriately excessive profanity] that are used to try to make a &quot;deep&quot; plot, they all end up pitiful and shallow.  The cop is the only one who  has anything remotely resembling depth...all the depth the other characters have is contrived.  I give the cast 4 stars for acting well to poorly written rles.  5 stars for the extra DVD of special features, 2 stars for the story and only 1 star for the disjointed plot.
 | product/productId: 0790747464 | review/userId: AQX2RIF7J2W9D | review/summary: Black and White Movies Can Be Colorful | review/text: I saw this movie once on TV and really liked it but could never find it anywhere for sale until recently.  Not only does it give a lot of insite into how Americans viewed themselves and their place in the world shortly after the war, it also has a great story line and beautiful scenery.  The movie was so well done that I didn't really notice it was in black and white.  It's a period piece that will memorialize the Doolittle raid on Tokio launched in response to Pearl Harbor.  I would recommend this movie for anyone, but especially people who are interested in World War II in particular and war movies in general.
 | product/productId: 0792844793 | review/userId: A3TK2IOP8UQ087 | review/summary: now its dark | review/text: I think no other filmmaker in modern times has had their work analyzed and intelectualized as much as David Lynch.  I'm not saying his work doesn't sometimes call for heavy conversations about the nature of reality, but sometimes understanding a lynch film takes nothing more than just allowing yourself to be immersed in the mood.  That being said, i think this film is the best introduction to the Lynch Universe.  <p>People will call this movie weird and confusing, but i think anyone who is confused by it must be suffering from a short attention span.  The story is very simple, and at times coincidental.  The tougher (yet not impossible) part, is picking up on the things that aren't being said, such as why exactly Jeffery feels the need to observe the details of an ongoing police investigation from the inside, and what has made Dorothy so confused that she thinks the only thing that can bring her happiness is pain.  Its all about what lurks behind the curtain, its about who's hiding in the closet, its about what goes on underneath the mask of humanity.  Watching this film, you get to ride shotgun with Jefferey Beaumont as he peels the layers away little by little... and you may feel yourself becoming as much of a voyeur as he has become.

But for Ferreri completists, the purchase of this set is mandatory due to the inclusion of THE SEED OF MAN and THE HOUSE OF SMILES - both making their U.S. DVD debut, as well as the first time these two films have been available with English subtitles ANYWHERE. And the black and white feature THE LITTLE COACH will be new for most viewers, since it's only previous U.S. release came over 10 years ago in a marginally released video edition. Also the film's bonus documentary MARCO FERRERI - THE DIRECTOR FROM ANOTHER PLANET - is authoritative and surprisingly comprehensive - with rare tidbits like Ferreri's lifelong diabetes and the attempted (and unsuccessful) suicide of actor David Warner during the shooting of Ferreri's film THE AUDIENCE.<br /><br />But those with an appetite for more Ferreri after completing this set might want to check out the English subtitled editions of HAREM, LA CAGNA and DILLINGER IS DEAD available at amazon.co.uk. Also, dvd.it provides Italian dvds (without English subtitles) of rarer Ferreri films like THE CONJUGAL BED, THE APE WOMAN, WEDDING MARCH, and DIARY OF A VICE. And the Spanish site dvd.es is a source for Ferreri's STORY OF PIERRA, THE FUTURE IS WOMAN, and his final film NITRATE BASE.

The expressiveness of his face in the songs, be it deep sorrow or pure joy, is as magical as his playing.  Many of the songs have special meaning to Phil, as he explains throughout.<br /><br />Having quite a few of Phil Coulter's recordings, there are a few songs on the video I would rather replace with others, but I suppose that is true of most recordings.  I would have liked for the medleys to play the songs longer, even if it meant covering fewer songs.  I was disappointed that "The Ballad of William Bloat" was not on it even though the cover says it is supposed to be.<br /><br />As with all great concerts, I wish the video was longer, though approximately 70 minutes is a fair amount.<br /><br />Songs include:<br /><br />Steal Away, Play On<br /><br />The Derry Air<br /><br />The Old Man<br /><br />Mancini Magic:  The Pink Panther, The Thorn Birds, Baby Elephant Walk, Moon River, Peter Gunn<br /><br />The Ballad Of William Bloat (listed, but not on video), I'll Tell Me Ma<br /><br />Cal, Local Hero<br /><br />Hoedown<br /><br />The Bonny Boy, Mid Term Break<br /><br />Scorn Not His Simplicity<br /><br />Ballads And Blarney:  The Boston Burglar, Muirsheen Durkan, Whiskey On A Sunday, Home Boys Home, The Merry Plough Boy, The Black Velvet Band, The Holy Ground<br /><br />Mo Ghile Mear (featuring Peadar O'Riada and The Coolea Choir)<br /><br />A Thiarna Dean Trocaire (featuring Peadar O'Riada and The Coolea Choir)<br /><br />Mise Eire<br /><br />The Town I Loved So Well

 | product/productId: 1572523581 | review/userId: A21911QJJHVGD2 | review/summary: Poignant, beautiful film -- nice DVD too | review/text: I caught My Life as a Dog on PBS many years ago. To those who have not seen this film, it's a bittersweet tear jerker told from a boy's point of view (somewhat similar to Christmas Story), filled with many super funny scenes, dramas, and surprises.<p>Directory Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m has gone to make a number of popular films in Hollywood (Cider House Rules, Chocolat, Shipping News, What's Eating Gilbert Grape), but I think this Swedish precursor is his superior work. His signature beautiful images (by cinematographer J&ouml;rgen Persson), filled with quirky yet fully defined supporting characters, and filled with heartwarming scenes.<p>Criterion's DVD is superior to all previous video presentations, remastered in high definition and presented in widescreen anamorphic video and original mono Swedish sound with faithful English subtitle. The images look a bit grainy, but I think very faithful to director's intention (who has supervised and approved the transfer) and completely satisfying.<p>The DVD is short of special features (just interview with Hallstr&ouml;m, his early short TV feature &quot;Shall With Go to My or Your Place or Each Go Home Alne&quot;, and trailer). Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 6301971817 | review/userId: A3S98L5B1SR9P1 | review/summary: Midnight Cowboy (1969) | review/text: If you have any intelligence, any emotion, anything beyond a desire to watch explosions and Vin Diesel, you will like this movie. While not often put in the same category as The Godfather or Casablanca, this movie is better than the others because it is NOT some huge epic family drama or war romance, but the story of two urban losers struggling to find a connection with something that makes life liveable. This was one of the first movies to combine American and European styles in one film and by doing became a more important film technically than given credit for. Who cares if it loses some shock value it once had? Every movie does eventually. That it still is absorbing proves its worth. Truly Great.
 | product/productId: 6301972198 | review/userId: A3SO2TIUEE8FKG | review/summary: The Human Guinea Pig | review/text: &quot;In dreams, some of us walk the stars. In dreams, some of us ride the whelming brine of space, where every port is a shining one, and none are beyond our reach. Some of us, in dreams, cannot reach beyond the walls  of  our own little sleep.&quot; In a prison, a murderer volunteers for a  dangerous experiment.  An alien scientist from planet Chromo is teleported  on Earth and soon the convict will be sent out there. Forget the storyline  and focus on the characters. Henry Silva, from &quot;Tourist  Attraction&quot;, is jumpy Chino Rivera, for instance : in the scene where  Chino, scared to death by the Chromoite, runs in a hurry.  We can see a  long dolly shot made with a hand-held camera  and we can hear a military  music to emphasize the tension. Michael Higgins is dead-serious scientist  Dr. Thomas Kellander : especially, after the alien's very violent murder in  the lake, he speaks of Chino to Julia while watching a shoe :  &quot;A  disease that walks like a man...&quot;. Diane Sands is frightened Dr. Julia  Harrison (and a small part by Dabney Coleman). I like the friendly  dialogues between Julia and Chino, when they talk about Chromo's food :  &quot;I'd better bring a couple of hero sandwiches with me.&quot; And when  they talk about the horror of the Chromoite : &quot;Everybody looks like a  monster to somebody.&quot; The cinematography is dark and effective due to  Conrad Hall's tough hand held camera shots. One of the best chiaroscuro  shot is when Chino is reading near the mice' cages.  The very  science-fiction music blends with O.B.I.T.'s haunting sound effects is  okay. The Chromoite alien is evil (in the teleportation scene when it turns  insane and agressive and destroys everything) and repulsive-enough (the way  it eats)  to watch the show. This monster is re-used, in part, later, for  The Guests. One more thing, I like Robert Johnson's distorted Chromo  transmission voice (&quot;Transmission point Chromo. Subject stable.  Sequence commences.  Initiate systems... Transmission accomplishes.&quot;)  A &quot;who is really the killer ?&quot; episode with great artistry  and a  fast-paced/action-packed orientation, directed by &quot;The Mutant&quot;  Alan Crosland, Jr.  and written by Joseph Stefano. &quot;Hunger, frightens  and hurts, and it has many faces,  and every man must sometimes face the  terror of one of them. Wouldn't it seem that a misery known and understood  by all men would lead Man not to deception and murder, but to faith, and  hope, and love ?&quot;

 | product/productId: 0784011664 | review/userId: A3ELSU1SHRX09Y | review/summary: Ooh. Pretty bad. Treat Williams has fabulous hair, though. | review/text: I had every intention of giving this film a chance -- I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment with Tom Berenger, and was eager to see Treat Williams do a great job in the sequel. I did like that they made at least some tenuous reference to the first film at the beginning of this one -- we are told that Berenger's Shale character is teaching in S. America with his Peace Corps girlfriend. Nice touch, that. Glad to know that they're doing OK. (Yeesh! I care about the welfare of fictional characters!)<p>I like Treat Williams (great hair) and BD Wong, and I thought they did fine in their roles. One other highlight was the guy who played the janitor. He was probably my favorite character in this film -- very fiesty and amusing. But even the presence of all these great actors could not redeem this dismal film. The plot holes are gaping wide; there are plausability problems all over the place, and then there's the story. What story? Yikes.<p>If you want nothing more than to see a few gratifying scenes where Williams amazes the surly kids with his awesome Green Beret skills, then you won't be disappointed. But if you are expecting anything close to the campy goodness of the first film, forget it.
 | product/productId: 0790705141 | review/userId: A3RHX8H7UF8C5R | review/summary: Psychotic and horrifying...  A hotel from Satan's franchise | review/text: As far as I am concerned, this is a finely honed horror story, scary as hell... with incredible performances by Duvall and Nicholson... and the hotel and the music.  Since so many reviewers cover the plot so well, I'll concentrate on some other points... Kubrick's masterful use of brilliant lighting to convey the horrors, the wonderful sets, and the music. One of the high moments of sheer horror for me was when Shelley Duvall found Jack's writing. No blood, no axes, no knives, no shouting, no threats...  nothing but her realization that the husband she loves almost to the point of worship is insane.<p>Until this moment, even we in the audience didn't realize how psychotic Jack is, but this punches that fact right into our souls. Maybe, we can think, at an earlier time, that he doesn't want his wife to see the wretched manuscript because it isn't any good, or because he isn't satisfied with it.  Once seen, it's clear that the man not only has become insane, but that he's always been insane, maybe even before he stepped through the door.<p>Mother and son have been living with a madman, maybe all their lives. I think Danny realizes this. Tony has misgivings about the place, and leaks these premonitions into Danny's mind. I take it that Tony is a manifestation of his Shining, not a figment of his young mind. Is Tony trying to guard little Danny? Or is there a fight to see who controls Danny's body? Does Danny have both his father and Tony to fear? I don't think so. Tony does `take over', but Danny comes back. The kid shows a feisty nature and comes through with flying colors in a horrible situation.<p>Shelley's character is no match, it seems, for the raw,uncaring brutality of her sot of a husband, but she comes through for herself and her child. Wendy comes across extremely strongly as being ineffectual and weak, thanks to the wonderful performance of Shelley Duvall. Wendy is hysterical, and it's clear how much  she wants to love him, in spite of Jack's cold hatred.  When push comes to shove, however, she stops him cold, as much as it's within her power to do- then it's Jack who's seen to be the weakling, as shown by his `final' meeting with Delbert Grady. <p>Speaking of Grady...  he's only in a small part of the film, and is such a polite man; servile to the point of being sickening. However, his hatred is chilling. Grady is a ghost, but has the attitudes of a demon, hateful and intolerant. In spite of the fact that Jack was caretaker long before him (See the photo Kubrick slowly zooms in on at the end.), Grady is clearly the Boss and is calling the shots. He might as well be Satan, with the Overlook Hotel as his earthly abode, during the winter months. The bartender is part of the horror. In spite of the fact that he looks entirely human, Kubrick's masterful lighting brings something of the outer dark to what at first seems to be a throwaway character. <p>The music, from the first ominous bars of Dies Irae,  sets the mood for the story  and takes the spare plot into the upper stratosphere of horror.  I've seldom heard such scary and horrifying compositions in any movie. The Dies Irae  is familiar to me, and is an old piece of music, going back at least into the nineteenth century. The other horrifying pieces sound very modern to my ears; discordant and creepy.  They just point out Kubrick's genius  in setting the mood. Without it, I don't think The Shining would have worked out as well as a horror film as it did, in spite of Jack Nicholson's incredible performance as Jack Torrance. The man-in-a-bear-suit scene was frightening because of its sheer inanity, and the hints of sexual perversity. What were those people doing? Under many circumstances, whatever they were doing could be viewed as being entirely harmless- a sexual liaison in costume. Big deal. I don't think Delbert Grady's ax murdering of his family was the only atrocity committed and the film hints strongly at this. With that in mind, a viewer can easily expect to see another murdered child or parts of her.  <p>Jack Nicholson always turns in wonderful work. He's a total professional and physically fits the role of Jack Torrance like a glove. Thanks to Nicholson's work, we can seriously wonder if Jack Torrance ever was truly sane. And, since the family seems so normal on the surface, it's a frightening thought for the rest of us.<p>The Scatman is affecting, and brings a human perspective lacking in the rest of the cast. Danny, thanks to Tony, almost seems non-human, as though he's a spirit visiting this world from the Other Side. Wendy is hysterical, obviously distraught by their financial situation, then torn asunder by Jack's horrid betrayal. The hotel owner is a cypher, just a necessary plot item needed to explain the Overlook to Jack, and thus to the audience. Delbert Grady and the bartender are ghosts, and rather demonic, at that. The twins can scarcely be seen as human, considering how they stand so still, and work to ensnare little Danny in the Overlook's hellish homicidal insanities. Scatman's character, the chef, seems to provide that human element of caring and love, while keeping sane under a weight of knowledge that would overwhelm a normal person.  All in all, The Shining, under Kubrik, is a cinematic gem. <p>I do not mention King's version, either book, or televison version, for a simple reason... I have not read the book, nor have I seen the show. When I do, I can compare them. The Shining is probably one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century.

Granted there are some songs missing and that was not good but some of the new songs are great such as  &quot;Sign&quot; I have seen this movie tons of times and I still love it.  I like the new Disney version of Annie but felt that it lacked something.  I guess my impression of Annie has always been based more in this movie and  I just couldn't get into the other one.  I just love Annie but I don't  think that some of these other reviews do justice to this movie.  I guess  everyone just needs to see it for themselves.  I own both versions and  watch both of them but I have to say I enjoy this version more.
 | product/productId: 0790751305 | review/userId: A2BWQ2C3QW32YP | review/summary: It's a hell of a thing killing a man..... | review/text: Now this is a film. Eastwood's seminal Western should really have marked the end of the genre - 'Unforgiven' says all there is to say about a time that has been eulogised as some kind of mythical golden age throughout the history of Hollywood. The fact that he hasn't made a film fit to wipe the shoes of this 1992 classic since emphasises it's power: when 'Unforgiven' ends it feels as though something in the air has changed - as though an era has ended. This is moviemaking at it's darkest, starkest and most brutally honest. The resonance of Unforgiven carries greater weight because Eastwood's name is attached to it - the most famous cowboy of the silver screen, bar John Wayne, spends the first ten minutes of the film rolling around on his backside in a pigsty, and the last 30 minutes ranting deliriously while in a fever.  William Munny is no hero - he is the kind of ruthless killer that Eastwood would have blown away in a stylised hail of lightning-fast bullets in earlier films. Munny is an aged, poverty-stricken widower who is utterly ashamed of his violent past and briefly found redemption through love.  However, his wife is now dead, and the only way he can see to support his children is to take on one last bounty hunting job.  The fact that the wanted men are responsible for mutilating a prostitute seems to lend justice to the quest, and Munny succeeds in drumming up the support of his old partner, played by Morgan Freeman. Together with a young would-be gunslinger who is full of the bravado of youth, the three head for the hills and straight into the hands of Little Bill, the corrupt and sinister sherriff (played by Gene Hackman in Oscar-winning form), another killer from the old days. From their first meeting, a sense of impending doom casts its shadow over the film. We learn that the most effective killers are the ones who shoot their opponents in the back, or unarmed - the ones who keep a straight head, not the best looking ones who are fastest on the draw.  Eastwood, aided with a brilliant script by David Webb Peoples, constantly undermines the traditional values of the old Westerns. There is no clear cut sense of good versus evil or justice prevailing over malice. When the kid, clearly feeling greater remorse than he had anticipated after shooting one of the wanted men, and in an attempt to justify his act, says to Munny "he had it coming" , Munny replies "we all have it coming kid". And later Munny, describing what it is like to destroy another human being, however much they "deserved" it, says "it's a hell of a thing killing a man, taking away all he's got - and all he's ever gonna have". This is the crux of `Unforgiven' - death is final, irreversible, and comes to us all whether we deserve it or not.<p>Unforgiven is a beautifully shot movie.  The gorgeously evocative cinematography displays the colours of autumn at their most poignant and the descent into winter clearly mirrors the coldness at the heart of the film: vengeance must be bought, but at a high price -  their can be no redemption for the avengers, no satisfaction for the avenged. In fact nobody benefits from the terrible denouement, and all we are left with is the knowledge that, even when men do evil things for good reasons, the things they do are still evil.
 | product/productId: 0790751143 | review/userId: A1ER6IYOMM8VCT | review/summary: NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES!, BUT VERY GOOD! | review/text: This is one of my least favorites in the series. I rate this right behind "The Dead Pool" The third installment gives "Harry" yet another partner,this time it's Tyne Daly(Cagney & Lacy)(Judging Amy)and the movie has that 70's TV movie feel once again. I am a fan of the entire series and I do like this film, but it just seemed like it didn't have much new to add to the series. This is one of the shortest films in the "Dirty Harry" franchise, but it didn't seem like it. It is by all means a very good and worthy installment and should not be missed. The DVD transfer is very good and the disc has some extras.

 | product/productId: 1572524030 | review/userId: A1M6WS6IUHN12V | review/summary: Poetic Genius | review/text: The editorial review was just about dead on.  Gil Scott Heron, in his poetic genius, brought to light stories of the people, stories of the streets, and an honest look at the role politics played with the people.  Though &quot;not for everybody&quot; perhaps, his lyrics to &quot;Whitey on the Moon&quot; ring true once again, today.  Powerful, powerful stuff from a man in a class all by himself.  I only wish there were more videos of his other works.<p>If you have a love for the written word, for poetry that strikes you, makes you think and has a rhythm to it -- also have a look at Pinero (starring Benjamin Bratt) and Cyrano de Bergerac (starring Jose Ferrer).  These 3 videos, though totally different, are each wonderful works.
 | product/productId: 6301824415 | review/userId: A276M3NSIY9B82 | review/summary: Total Recall Special Edition | review/text: One of Schwarzenegger's best movies. No, he won't ever win an Academy Award for best actor, that is, if he ever acts again. Action-Adventure is his forte though he proved to be more than able in comedic roles.<br /><br />Total Recall falls into the former category & is a science-fiction movie. The action takes place on Mars & involves memories & false memories. Rachel Ticotin co-stars as the female lead. But the female that shines is Sharon Stone portraying Schwarzenegger's wife. It was this experience with director Paul Verhoeven that led to her casting in Basic Instinct (directed by Paul Verhoeven). The story is fast paced, well acted (yes) & well directed. The movie is based upon a short story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" by Phillip K. Dick.<br /><br />The bonus features on this edition are many. They include an audio commentary with Schwarzenegger & Verhoeven, a documentary , a virtual vacation segment, the story boards, a photo gallery, production notes, &  a cast & crew information piece.

 | product/productId: 0793984297 | review/userId: A4UKBG3M5U5TI | review/summary: "I hate people I don't like," | review/text: "Twelve Chairs" is perhaps Mel Brooks least known film, although it's much better than most of his post-1970s movies.  Ron Moody ("Oliver") stars as a former Russian nobleman whose mother-in-law on her death bed confesses to having sewn the family jewels into one of the 12 chairs of their dining room suite right before the Russian Revolution.  Unfortunately, she also told her scheming priest (Dom DeLuise), and the two quickly race off to find the dining room chairs and recover the jewels.  Along the way, Moody is forced to become partners with a young beggerman (a very young looking Frank Langella).  Mel makes a rather funny cameo as Tikon, the former assistant to Mood's character.<br /><br />Although "Twelve Chairs" is a bit obscure, it's actually based on a very well-known and oft-filmed Soviet satirical novel by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov.  The premise is terrific, and Brooks does a good job keeping the plot interesting and the pace going.  The movie also benefits tremendously from being filmed in Eastern Europe (the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), which gives it a unique look for a comedy.  Overall, it's an interesting movie.  Unfortunately, it's simply not as funny as Brooks' best films.  Yes, there are some funny scenes, but the movie fails to sustain the humor for long; nevertheless, I did enjoy the movie.  Fans of Brook's 1970s movies will likely appreciate "Twelve Chairs," and there's probably enough here to keep most others entertained.

Ignore the low ratings! | review/text: I have never felt compelled to write a movie review before this-but after seeing some of the low ratings, I just felt the need to come to its defense! This movie has everything! Action, Comedy, Romance, etc! The chemistry between Benicio & Alicia is perfect! It all just fits & I've never understood why the critics panned it!! Frankly I dont care - they've been wrong before & this has always been one of my favorite movies!! I too had never seen Benicio Del Toro in anything before & fell in love with him in this! Alicia Silverstone is at her best, as is Christopher Walken, & Harry Connick Jr. & the soundtrack is stellar! Ignore the critics who didnt like it & give it a chance--you wont regret it!
 | product/productId: 0783227434 | review/userId: AT2ONGBAQ8HFD | review/summary: Classic Camp!  An absolute favorite! | review/text: I have seen all three movies in the Evil Dead Trilogy and I must say that Army of Darkness is superior to the first two movies. They are gory B- horror flicks with moments of humor and for entertaintment value on a campy evening, they are just the ticket, but Army of Darkness is something more.<p>Not only is Bruce Campbell a hunk, he has a sense of humor and comedic timing that make this movie great.  Whether he's lecturing the heathens from the past about his ' boom stick' or wooing the heroine with his ' gimme some sugar, baby' line, he's perfect in this movie.  Of course, he's survived the first two, but he shines in this movie.  I don't know if it has to do with the Dino De Laurentis production of this third movie,or the director, but they had the right idea when they put Bruce, his boom stick and Embeth Davidtz together in this movie.<p>I have seen it at least a dozen times and every time I laugh until I cry.  The scene where Ash / Bruce is hiding inside the windmill is hilarious, as is the following scene after the 'seed' he swallowed sprouts!<p>I had heard that this movie had been translated into a video game and wasn't surprised, because after you see the seige and what Ash / Bruce can do with a high school chemistry text book and his battered Joe Friday land cruiser anything is possible!<p>This movie is a must have for anyone who loves the horror genre with a humorous twist.  Everything about it, from the costuming to the way Ash / Bruce wears his chainsaw and rugged mullet are fantastic.  I would suggest getting your video through Amazon, because after the final scene in the movie, I don't know if you'll be able to find it in the video aisle at S-Mart!

 | product/productId: 079213690X | review/userId: A2GKMCO8QDOELK | review/summary: Overrated ego trip, even if it's fun to watch | review/text: This may not have been Mel Gibson's first directorial effort, but it's certainly the most egotistical of his movies. Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is so modest, in fact, that he allows his character to be not only the greatest warrior ever seen (able to ride his *horse* into a building, kill a man, and still get out alive despite the presence of a phalanx of armed guards), but so charismatic that the daughter of the enemy king falls in love with him after only one meeting.  He not only fights and romances, he also speaks several languages, and can dazzle lords and commoners alike with his intelligence. (&quot;En francais, s'il vou plait!&quot;) With a stirring speech sounding suspiciously like Kenneth Branagh in HENRY V, Wallace inspires his men to feats of derring-do, invents battle strategies never even conceived during that day and age (because they were tactically impossible, such as letting the enemy run right into a wall of spears), and leads his army into head-on crashes against the foe that bear more than a passing resemblance to the battle scene from Eisenstein's ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  And when Wallace finally meets his end, it's not enough to merely die a defiant, heroic death...instead, he becomes a Christ figure and has a full-blown crucifixion.  (The portrayal of the king's son as a flaming drag queen brought howls of protest from gay-rights groups, as homophobia is a running theme in a number of Gibson's movies.)<p>The movie is certainly not boring, and the battle scenes are good (if bloody); but it's merely an attempt to combine Errol Flynn's ROBIN HOOD with the typical Mel Gibson character, such as we see in MAD MAX or LETHAL WEAPON.  I'd lament the fact that this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 1995, but then the playing field that year was very poor and the Oscars are usually given to the most &quot;politically correct&quot; movies anyways.

Who else but she could have gone through so many costume changes and looked as good in each one? Who else at the time had the range and experience, as well as beauty, to tackle the role?<p>Richard Burton had just the right fire and flair to pull off the role of Marc Antony. It didn't hurt, either, that he was infatuated by his co-star.<p>Rex Harrison utilized his commanding presence to his advantage in the somewhat third-tier part of Julius Caesar. Although he appears roughly in the first half of the film, he still is memorable in his part.<p>Hume Cronyn, Cesare Donova, and the great Roddy McDowall are brilliant in their supporting roles. Future &quot;Archie Bunker&quot; Carroll O'Conner and Academy-award winner Martin Landau are also on board in significant parts. Veteran character actor John Hoyt, always effective, portrays a Roman senator.<p>Alex North's score is one of his best. Too bad that it is not in circulation at present.<p>Now, I would be extremely satisfied if Twentieth Century Fox could find those reported missing two hours of film. <p>Would love to see how the whole bloody pleasure would have looked at six hours long!

The proprietor is hoping to make some bucks with his exhibit.<br /><br />So on a dark and stormy night, Chic and Wilbur (Abbott and Costello) uncrate the fiends, but Wilbur is the only one who actually encounters them and the sight gags are very funny.<br /><br />Lugosi reprises his role as Dracula, many years after his last incarnation in the original 1931 film, Dracula.  Glenn Strange, no stranger to the Frankenstein's monster costume, is the monster.<br /><br />Lon Chaney, Jr. returns as the Wolfman, bent on stopping Dracula from reanimating the Frankenstein monster with the brain of Wilbur!  [If they had succeeded, wouldn't Frankenstein run around yelling "AAABAAAAT!"?  Oh well....]<br /><br />There are strong women in this play -- Sandra, the woman who actually only wants Wilbur for his brain and who recently left Europe for some questionable medical practices.  She is the patsy for Dracula.  And the insurance investigator Joan, who at first acts very able and intelligent, but after the party scene she does not play much of a role.<br /><br />The jokes are silly and funny.<br /><br />Larry:  When the moon rises, I turn into a Wolf!<br />Wilbur:  Yeah, you and 20 million other guys!<br /><br />Or Chic and Wilbur discuss the blind dates they've had.<br /><br />Wilbur:  That girl I kissed had so much bridge work, I had to pay toll!<br /><br />And of course the physical humor with the pratfalls and gags is what makes A&C A&C!<br /><br />Universal Pictures did not worry about continuity and you shouldn't either.

 | product/productId: 6300251012 | review/userId: A3OEECMCM2T4KQ | review/summary: One of most Memorable Films of the 70's | review/text: Adapted to the screen from the Thomas Berger novel, Little Big Man tells the sweeping story of Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) told by the character himself interviewed in an old folks home as a centenarian. (Well over 100 years of age).<br /><br />If there was one word to describe this film it would have to be charming, because it crosses many genres: drama, comedy, western, adventure, war, historical, biographical etc. One of the top twenty films made in the seventies, aside from The Godfather & Godfather 2, this movie would have to be one of the most memorable.<br /><br />Jack Crabb's story of his life is a collection of anecdotes from the time he was kidnapped by Indians and raised as one of their own, to then be thrown back into the "white" mans world.<br /><br />Really this film reveals the American Indians' civil and sane view of life over the white man's narrow and aggressive natures during that time.<br /><br />Leaving his tribe, Jack Crabb is placed with the Pendrake family, the father is the town's paster and his beautiful though sexually frustrated wife played wonderfully by the beautiful Faye Dunaway. It is here, witnessing Mrs. Louise Pendrakes adulterous nature that he first begins to discover the insanities and hypocrisies of the "white man".<br /><br />The saddest part of the film is Crabb's return to the Cheyenne, where he marries a lovely squaw and eventually has a child.<br /><br />It is here he reunites with "Grandfather" or "Old Lodge Skins" (Chief Dan George) who deservedly won the Oscar that year for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The only way to describe "grandfather" is wise, simple, funny and confused about the white man's ways. He asks Little Big Man many questions about the white man's behaviour and customs and Jack Crabb, most of the time, does not have an answer.<br /><br />The United States Calvary one morning descends upon the native village and massacres every man, woman and child. This raid was led by the infamous George Armstrong Custer, (Richard Mulligan) and is based on true historical events. Crabb's wife and baby are brutally killed by the soldiers though Crabb escapes to return to the white man's world as a drunk.<br /><br />Many mishaps and circumstances finally lead Crabb to join the Seventh Calvary under Custer's command as a scout, and is known in the regiment as "mule skinner". It is here that Crabb seeks revenge for the murder of his family.<br /><br />Grabb takes part in the famous battle of The Little Big Horn, as the soldiers are massacred, his life is saved once again because of an Indian from his past recognizes him before he is scalped.<br /><br />My favourite and more than likely the funniest scene in the film is "Grandfather's" death, where he "knows" it is time for him to die and move to a better place. He lies down, closes his eyes and it begins to rain. He opens his eyes and asks if he has arrived to the great pastures...funny yet heartfelt.<br /><br />It has been said that the seventies was the decade where good filmmaking lost its way.<br /><br />Viewing Little Big Man once again, this statement is false beyond a doubt.<br /><br />"Little Big Man" is a truly great film to own and view time and again.

Scott Fitzgerald story is one of the best from the series as it captures the attitude of the times, the '20's.  The teenagers are all affecting such sophistication.  Bernice isn't used to this New York City sophistication, and is painfully shy at first on her visit, but finds herself prodded and pushed.  The lesson is eventually learned, the lesson that it's best to be yourself since nobody else can do as good a job at being you as you can.  <p>Importantly, the lesson is given to us in a most entertaining manner.  One who hasn't become acquainted with Fitzgerald should find this taste of his skills addictive.<p>Well worth watching.
 | product/productId: 6300181545 | review/userId: A3FHSLWEMH7JD8 | review/summary: Nostalgia comes no better | review/text: On a literary level, there are many deficiencies in Going my Way, and it is no musical gem. Yet those of us who tend towards nostalgia would find this a relaxing, fun, highly memorable film.<p>There is no coherent plot, and action moves from one (barely developed) sub-&quot;story&quot; to another. The underlying story works best when it deals realistically with life in a rather poor parish: the super-religious gossip, kids in a bit of trouble, young couple who are sleeping together (but making it sound innocent), pastor faced with financial problems, charismatic younger priest who is a good influence on the young in spite of themselves. (I must add that those of us who have known the &quot;real life&quot; counterparts of all, as I certainly have, will find it refreshing that political correctness does not distort them!) Unfortunately, several major influences in the story are distracting and rather annoying. I've known many a &quot;real&quot; Father O'Malley, and his organising kids into a group (to their great benefit) is indeed realistic, but their emerging as a highly polished classical choir in short order is absurd. Fr Chuck's totally &quot;by chance&quot; meeting with the old girlfriend who just happens to be headlining at the Met, and who both gets the entire Metropolitan Opera orchestra to present the demonstration of Chuck's tiresome tune to publishers, then arranges a highly lucrative concert tour for the now-brilliant boy choir, would have best been eliminated, since it gives the production an entirely artificial quality - as bizarre as their having been granted three wishes! Nor is anything accomplished by the church going on fire...<p>Yet there is enough here that one cannot help but love - and which are true but no longer possible to find. I, for one, greatly miss the days when such colourful characters as Mrs Quimp and Father Fitzgibbons were standard in many a parish - when working class, city neighbourhoods like this had not been either reduced to slums nor turned into luxury flats for the rich - when many kids were helped immensely by associations with dedicated priests. As well, it is a light-hearted, affectionate presentation, with much of the type of delightful humour that died out with Irish priests of Bing's generation. <p>It's like a visit to the old neighbourhood, with lots of friends with whom to renew acquaintance. For a restful few hours, one can relax and pretend that one could still turn a corner and find that it is all still there.

Why?<br />  I know many people have probably written this about this movie, but it's true! 'Metropolis'  is a precurser for all the other great sci-fi movies that came after.  It has everything! A hero; a bad guy, romance, damsel in distress, and alot more.<br />  Yes, this is a silent movie, made in 1927, but this doesn't subtract from the mood or the message of the movie.  Also, the special effects for this movie was WAY before it's time.  Although this movie may not appeal to everyone, the serious movie buff will want to have this one in their library!
 | product/productId: 0788815490 | review/userId: A27CFNHYZG6WS8 | review/summary: As good a stab at late Henry James as we're likely to get. | review/text: 'The Wings Of The Dove' is a marvel of modern literary adaptation.  Henry James novels are all difficult to film, but the late three masterpieces, of which 'Dove' is the first, with their agonising syntax hovering over their referents like timid vultures flying away before they feast, are surely impossible.  And a 'faithful' adaptation of this novel WOULD be impossible.  Late James doesn't tell stories, his books are about the act of reading and interpreting, about decentring familiar modes of narration, about the importance of the right word, and so are riven with gaps and ambiguity.  James was busy creating modernism and the literary 20th century; director Iain Softley and screenwriter Hossein Amini are obliged to create a traditional, coherent story in an accesible way for as big an audience as possible.  So where James hems and haws over what exactly is going on in a particular scene or dialogue, euphemises, defers, revokes, shifts, obscures, Softley and Amini have to make choices, have to say THIS definitely happened, and THIS as a result followed.  James purists no doubt shuddered at the wholesale reworking of episodes, the systematic miscasting, the rendering conventional and sentimental character motivation, and the dubious interpretation of key events.  And, it's true, watching it, the film seems less an adaptation of James than a hazy remembrance of it, or a persistant misreading.  The vast majority who haven't read the book will be grateful that Softley and Amini managed to create a coherent and consistent narrative out of such intractable material.  A 'faithful' 'Dove' would have been an unwieldy, unwatchable arty bore.<p>If you want to find Henry James, you don't look to his stories, but the way he tells them.  Within the limits set by the economic realities of modern film-making, it is in his mise-en-scene that Softley is most brilliantly Jamesian.  He manages to interweave an admirable amount of James' symbolic motifs to visualise thematic concerns - economics, water, heights etc.  The film is a goldmine of period detail - the early 20th century has been comparatively under-represented on film, and the various bibelots, vehicles and costumes on show are a constant delight.  But even when filming in real locations, Softley's compositions look deliberately artificial and stylised.  His deep-focus cinematography emphasises the objects and decor surrounding the characters, highlighting the way materialism, environment, culture and economic need alienates the characters from their emotional needs, as does the framing, 'boxing' characters, separating them from each other; proscenium arches stage the dramas of conflicting performances we're watching.  Costumes and decor don't just suggest a period effect, but create meaning(s) too.  James' famously shifting narration finds an equivalent in Softley's playing with point-of-view, alternating unmotivated, gliding, overhead tracks with ambivalent character viewpoints.  Jamesian set-pieces aren't given the slow-burning effect they need in this disarmingly brisk film, but the Venice sequences are suitably enigmatic, in particular a haunting, nocturnal gondola ride.  In other words, although forced to show more than James ever would, Softley preserves the author's sense of a whole other world of feeling beyond or beneath the text, upholding James' irresolution and openness to the very tense end.  Amini even daringly rewrites James, trasposing the title and its symbolic diffusion from the sickly, saintly Milly to Merton and, especially, to the gaunt, aquiline Kate and her plumed hats.  <p>If 'Dove' doesn't quite soar to the heights of the very great adaptations of modernist literature (Visconti's 'Death In Venice', Ruiz's 'Time Regained'), than that's a part of its integrity; its relentless narrowing of focus and viewpoint, and unromantic observing are wholly true to its begettor.<p>(The shimmering DVD transfer is even more beautiful than the cinema release I saw, but the accompanying features (especially the chapter selections) are unhelpful)

An ode to a dying genre, Unforgiven is a poetic justice to dispel many of the misconceptions that numerous Western movies have established. I can see the blind-as-a-bat boy who fills in the place for the audience members while the old-timer veterans of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman show literally what the life in the West is truly like. This is a clear-cut difference between men and boys. I love the acting, the mood, the somber setting, and the unique story of Unforgiven. What makes Unforgiven so great is how realistic the movie feels while depending on the mystique of the legend out of William Munny, played adeptly by no one other than Clint Eastwood, while it becomes a monster in the final climax. There is a great sense of humor throughout the film. Moreover, Morgan Freeman once again proves that he makes a perfect supporting actor with Clint Eastwood. I am impressed with everything about Unforgiven, and it will stand out as one of the most enduring Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood deservingly gets recognition for this picture and also for Million Dollar Baby. I've always knew that Clint Eastwood was a true filmmaker, and this one, he proved his mark. While nobody had paid attention to this man, Jaimz Woolvett gave a standout performance as the Schofield Kid. What he did deserves accolades. All in all, Unforgiven is a genuine Western film noir.<br /><br />8/11: Nearly the last true Western made, Unforgiven rights the wrongs that many Westerns in the past have committed, further mythologizing the Old West for something that it's really not. Unforgiven boasts of an all around cast including Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman. These three are the reason why you watch the film. It is as good as it gets. More important, Clint brings a resume with him when it comes to Western films, many of them quite bad, so it is obviously he set his heart on making the best Western as possible and leave his mark in the now dead genre. One underrated performance, never lauded by anyone, is by Jaimz Woolvett as the blind-as-a-bat Scholfield Kid. It's too bad he went empty that year. All in all, Unforgiven is a masterpiece and one of Clint's usual unforgettable trademarks.

 | product/productId: 0790741164 | review/userId: A2ZLROGIL2V7GV | review/summary: "Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison, politics is power..." | review/text: Oliver Stone's "JFK" is a monstrous epic that revolves around the whole mystery around President Kennedy's assassination.  While it is a dramatic picture and Stone most likely twisted a few things to make this a more relevant and better movie, it is still an undeniable powerhouse that has you go through a whole set of emotions, ranging from fear, anger, paranoia and sadness.  There's no question that the majority of the country believes that there is more to the assassination than we were lead to believe.  I don't think it's exactly how it is in the movie, but that's not important.  What is important is that the film works for many reasons.<br /><br />President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Lee Harvey Oswald is the suspect and gets shot shortly after.  There is a secretive and brief hearing on the whole assassination, and it is in stone that Oswald was a lone gunman and nobody else was involved.  Seems like an open-and-shut-case, but District Attorney Jim Garrison isn't willing to buy it.  With his staff, they decide to work on the case, until they are shut down by the government.  Three years later, Garrison isn't willing to stand by in silence anymore and decides to go ahead with the case.  The further he digs, the more horrible truths he uncovers.  Not only that, but people high up in the ranks are willing to do anything to make sure that the American Public will never find out about them.<br /><br />As I said, this isn't meant to be an entirely accurate portrayal of how everything happened.  It suggests to you that it could've been this way, and it even does a good job of presenting its case to you.  What I think Stone was trying to achieve was to create his own commentary on how people feel about the handling of the whole assassination and how sloppily the case was handled.  The film wasn't made to merely exploit the death of Kennedy, but what it does exploit is the fact that we're willing to believe anything they tell us in the media.  It's a hard concept to grasp, because it's not too far from the truth.  The movie is brilliantly directed and well-acted.  Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career.  The film has a whole list of famous actors in it, like Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and a whole bunch more.  They are all fantastic in their roles.<br /><br />A word of warning; this is a VERY LONG movie.  It is about 3 and a half hours long in running time.  If you want to watch this, then you have to really commit to it.  If you're not in the mood for a very lengthy movie, then you will not be able to enjoy this.  The new 2-Disc Special Edition offers a remastered director's cut that looks and sounds great.  Another interesting feature is the documentary, "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy."  Extras included are deleted/extended scenes, commentary from the director, theatrical trailer, essays and DVD-ROM features.  A very nice package that does the film justice.<br /><br />JFK" is an amazing picture that did not bore me for a single second.  Not only does it work as a powerful drama, but it also works as an intense thriller.  Did everything happen the way the movie proposes?  Maybe, maybe not.  What the film does is make you think about everything that happened around the assassination.  Any film that can get the brain thinking is more than okay in my book.  A very character-driven and passionate epic that is perfectly executed by Oliver Stone.<br />-Michael Crane

You guys normally do such great work with DVD releases. You have sixteen Elvis Presley titles; PUT THEM ALL IN ONE BOX SET! You currently offer no less than four box sets, no combination of which would give the consumer all 16 titles! I could get half of the titles if I bought the Blue Suede Collection. But this set overlaps each of the other three, leaving me with eight other individual titles to purchase. Or I could buy the Signature Collection and The Hollywood Collection, which combine to give me 12 of the 16 titles. Unfortunately, the Signature Collection is an older set, and it does not feature the new 2007 re-release versions of the DVDs. And even if I bought all three of those sets, I would STILL have to purchase Double Trouble and The Trouble With Girls separately. MGM has all four of their Elvis films in one box; and Paramount has all eight of their Elvis titles available in one box set. Come on Warner, help a guy out!

I've been a big fan of Ms. Day for quite some time now and I was so excited about this DVD release.<br /><br />I pre-ordered it from Amazon and got it on 6/29 (it was released on the 28th!) and I couldn't be more pleased. It has all 28 episodes of the first season + Bonus features in a four disc set.....that's 13hrs!<br /><br />I've watched the bonus features and three episodes and I'm already hooked. The only downfall I've seen so far is that they play the opening/ending credits before every single episode but no biggie.  Also, it would have been awesome if Ms. Day would have done a recent commentary or something to that effect. Well, here's hopin' for Season 2!<br /><br />All you Doris fans buy this set!

 | product/productId: 0767842359 | review/userId: A39CX0EE4BZCZC | review/summary: Preposterous, But Lots Of Fun! | review/text: There are so many adjectives one could use describing this film, I wouldn't know where to begin to start. I'll just try to limit them to a few. The headline here states one of them. Others could be "ludicrous," "fun," "amusing," "stupid," etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, "El Mariachi," and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, "Once Upon A Time In Mexico" which is even more of the same.<br /><br />Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.<br /><br />The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for: outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi. It's one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek are the "good guys" but they aren't exactly Billy Graham and Mother Teresa. If they are the good guys, you can imagine how evil the "bad guys" are? Speaking of them, two of the toughest- looking hombres in the business are chief among the villains: Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Trejo.<br /><br />Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie.

I can't give this more than 3 stars, because you know where it's going before it even starts, but it does provide a fair number of chuckles along the way. There's a hilarious cameo appearance by Jon Lovitz, another by Billy Idol, and numerous funny references to mid-1980s culture. Not a great movie, but a pleasant light diversion.

Along the way, Indy also frees the village's children that the cult has kidnapped (the kids are used for slave labor to dig for the missing fourth stone). <p>Much darker than &quot;Raiders&quot; (and is the dark heart of the trilogy), &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; doesn't let up until the last frame fadeout. The opening is a classic, with the Cole Porter song &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; then taking a nose dive into its first big action sequence - an allout chaotic nightclub brawl that has Indiana searching for the antidote vial to the poison he drank while fighting off anything that gets in his way, including cigarette girls. The viewer also gets a crash course in avation (not a good one though, since Indy crashes the plane), a lesson on how to be more specific when ordering soup in a foreign country (just ask for broth, no eyeballs &amp; also stick to munching on fruit), the correct way in waking someone up &quot;from the black sleep of the Kali&quot; (make sure to have a torch and lighter fluid handy), and Dr. Jones demonstrates the correct way on cutting a rope bridge (make sure to hang on...tight).  <p>The film's production did have its problems.<br />Kate Capshaw didn't read the entire script before she got the part and was scared stiff to find out that some of her co-stars were going to be snakes and bugs. The scene where Willie falls off her elephant was cut short to her whining that she could lose her voice. In the original treatment of the script, Willie was to be surrounded in the mudpuddle with a bunch of snakes. Since Capshaw is deathly afraid of snakes (the day production was set to shoot the scene she was pale as a ghost and shaking) Spielberg opted to cut the scene from the film in exchange for the python, elephant trunk scene instead.<br />Harrison Ford had a severe herniated back problem after filming the fight between Indiana Jones and the Thugee Guard (the guard winds up getting hung up in the ceiling fan) in Indiana's quarters (the backflip while the guard is choking Ford is what caused the back problem). With Ford being out for 5 weeks, Jack Dearlove, Harrison Ford's stuntdouble, can be seen in all the long, tracking shots in the fight scene that leads up to the mine car chase (that includes the fight between Indiana and the huge Thugee Guard on the rock crusher). Ford and Spielberg did all the close up shots six weeks after shooting concluded on that particular sequence.<p>The film caused major controversy over the violent content in the film (an impaling, a hanging, and a heart sacrifice are heavy stuff for the PG going crowd). Spielberg went to Jack Valentii, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and asked if there could be a middle ground between PG and R ratings. By the end of the summer of 1984, and with the release of the Patrick Swayze film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, the PG-13 rating was born.  <p>I watched the film last night (the first time in a long time &amp; to celebrate its 20th anniversary) and I still say that &quot;Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom&quot; is decent enough entertainment and belongs in any video library (preferably DVD).

 | product/productId: 078322687X | review/userId: A3DY46ZABF4CMQ | review/summary: Don't you forget about The Breakfast Club! | review/text: The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places).<br /><br />Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well "not even exist at the school", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents.<br /><br />The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A
 | product/productId: 1589713397 | review/userId: A3C6CZC2JP67VK | review/summary: An Experience that you'll NEVER forget | review/text: I'd seen this movie just the other night, and even now there are images from the film flashing in my head.......... (Breath) .................. The movie is incredibly violent. I was amazed and simultaneously disgusted. "Irreversible" is the kind of movie that I thought was horribly devastating and wonderfully good at the same time. It really had a lasting effect on me. What is impressive about the movie is its realism. The majority of the movie is completely improvised; it is shot in real lighting. These realistic aspects make it more devastating. I just like to note: in the movie that the guy who came around the tunnel and saw the rape and just took off got me angrier the most.<br /><br />Irreversible" is definitely a serious piece of film making. It is raw, emotional, powerful, and shocking. The use of flashbacks is sequential - we see the 'end' scene first, then the scene that led up to it, then the scene that led up to that, and so on. It is full of disturbing images and innovative camera techniques. It can be described as a journey from hell to heaven. We start in reverse by seeing--at the beginning of the film--terrible scenes that are the conclusion of events we have yet to witness in flashback, slowly moving us from nightmare to bliss.  The revenge scene is very hard to take, but it makes sense, and is definitely justified, as the almost nonexistent plot unfolds. Halfway through the scene, I realized I couldn't take it anymore, and had to turn away. No matter how hard I shut my eyes and shifted myself, the pulsing soundtrack of the beating blared out of the speakers, making it just as uncomfortable with my eyes closed. Terrifying and disgusting just doesn't cut it, the effect is indescribable. The rape scene is where the camera is motionless. The movement and struggle of the victim - for nine long minutes -becomes paramount. Monica Bellucci is a brilliant actress because she conveys the pain and anguish this character is going through, making us feel for her. It all seems a bit too real and is definitely one of the most disturbing scenes in motion picture history, becoming a bit much to take.<br /><br />The saddest part to me is towards the end because the main characters are interacting with each like it's a normal day and they don't know what's coming. But we do. Nevertheless, with the strong impact this film causes, it does make you to think very seriously about what it shows you. Some people may just not have the stomach for such a BIG attack of the senses but I only recommend to those who can. If you're wondering if I would watch it again I probably would because I do own the DVD.
 | product/productId: 6301792769 | review/userId: A220FJEQNGMSRN | review/summary: The best of the trilogy in another poor DVD transfer | review/text: Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching the new DVD is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining "See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?"<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back suffered the least in the special edition reworkings (although the clunky rewriting of the scene with the Emperor shows Lucas' leaden touch with dialog only too clearly) and as a transfer suffers the least of the original versions, but it's still not good enough. The film itself holds up surprisingly well, fully deserving its reputation as the best (and naturally least commercially successful) of the series. A lot of the credit has to go to co-writer Leigh Brackett, with the film's verbal sparring having a classic Hollywood feel to it that gives it a mixture of the best of both worlds, while keeping things moving at a brisk pace. Irvin Kershner's direction brings the best out of the cast too, while the action scenes - particularly the battle on the ice - are the best in the series. It's just a shame that the film's (genuinely unexpected at the time) cliffhanger was thrown away in the follow-up.

Anderson directs this film is brilliant. An excellent cast with a crafty director shows why this film was nominated at both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. Tom Cruise give a more than Oscar worthy performance. Other notably great performances come from Macy, Moore and Hoffman.

Beart, you are distracting me... | review/text: This is not a sequel to "Jean de Florette", but the concluding part of the same story, "Water of the Hills" by the French master story-teller, Marcel Pagnol.  <p>Basically, it is an epic played out in that typically French way of drama-making: close relationship between the antagonists and the force beyond their control driving the story to its inevitable end.  A sort of modern take on Greek tragedy.  The film also features Verdi's "Force of Destiny" as its theme tune.<p>As with "Cyrano de Bergerac" by Rappeneau, the director here had a great story and great cast (Yves Montand shining through).  One uncharitably wonders what little he had to do in terms of creativity in such an ideal situation for any director to be in.<p>All in all, this is a great piece of French film making.  Highly recommended to anybody who loves good film, but especially for those whose idea of France does not go beyond Paris city boundary or "Freedom Fries".  You will have some idea about the French farmers by the end of this film.<p>By way of postscript, I believe this was Beart's film debut and she is unbelievably beautiful in this, which somewhat disturbs the film as a whole.  If I am not mistaken, she married Auteil, who plays poor Ugolin in the film, in real life (now divorced).  They have a twisted sense of humour over there in France...

The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting is superb. Moreover, this film is somewhat based on the real life experiences of Dr. Oliver Sacks, a prominent psychiatrist. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography also shines; this is not a film you'll forget anytime soon.<br /><br />When the action starts we meet a healthy young boy named Leonard Lowe (Anthony J. Nici) and two of his friends playing and going to school in the 1930s. Unfortunately, Leonard develops an illness so disabling he cannot write his exams in school. Leonard must stay home every day and he becomes more and more ill over time. We then flash forward to the summer of 1969 to meet Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) who, despite his relative lack of clinical experience, gets hired to practice psychiatry at a hospital in The Bronx area of New York City. Dr. Sayer's coworkers, including the doctors, think very little of him; and Sayer's only friend is one of the nurses named Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner). Many of the patients in the chronic care hospital have been either comatose or unresponsive for decades; and clearly the staff has given up on them. Nevertheless, Sayer and Nurse Costello do extensive chart research and they find that many if not all of the patients had encephalitis when they were younger--could this be a clue as to how to treat them?<br /><br />Sayer thinks he has an answer that can help the patients; but his boss and colleagues bristle when he suggests using a drug called L-Dopa. Sayer thinks that this drug could help the patients at the hospital although it was designed to treat entirely different disorders. Dr. Sayer bravely insists that at least one patient should be allowed to try the drug on an experimental basis; and thus the now grown up Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro) is given the drug.<br /><br />Much to the delight of Sayer, Leonard "awakens" from his relatively catatonic state and experiences the change in the world that has come about during his nearly thirty years of being "away." Leonard is shocked that he is now a man; and his mother Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) is sometimes hurt when Leonard wants to spend time with a woman instead of her! Leonard also wants to go for a walk alone outside the hospital; but even Dr. Sayer is worried that he could be taken advantage of all alone in the real world without some supervision.<br /><br />Yes, even more patients get better with the proper dosages of the drug L-Dopa. But will things stay that way? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />In particular, the performances in this film are unforgettable. Robert DeNiro is stellar as the grown up Leonard Lowe; and Robin Williams surely does a huge stretch from being the funny, wacky comedian to playing the role of a somewhat nerdy doctor in this movie. Julie Kavner also turns in a convincing performance as the one staff member who truly believes in Dr. Sayer.<br /><br />Awakenings deserves to be in your DVD collection. This film will appeal especially to people like me who have worked with troubled or sick individuals in hospitals or clinics; and people who enjoy human interest stories will appreciate this motion picture as well.

I jumped at the chance to get it again on DVD.<br /><br />The film is so good that you forget that it is silent and just enjoy the story.<br /><br />A note of interest the art director on this film William Cameron Menzies is the producer of the 1941 version of this film, another of the all time great fantasy films.<br /><br />There is also a version made in the early 60s staring Steve Reeves that follows the original film faithfully and is worth seeing.<br /><br />Mike
 | product/productId: 0783225903 | review/userId: A1SVXJZ3386U2D | review/summary: Simply Amazing | review/text: I had heard about "Brazil" and was familiar with Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame.  I figured that there were a lot of possibilities with this movie but I never expected what I watched last night.  I am still trying to sort it out but I know enough to know that I watched a great movie.<br /><br />Frankly, I had toyed with getting this movie several years ago but I held off due to the steep prices I kept finding.  I bought a used copy at a more reasonable price and found that I got the three CD set.  I generally just watch the movie with little or no regard for the extras.  "Brazil" is unique enough that I may make an exception with this set.<br /><br />My first impression is that "Brazil" is a film that looks like what the movie version of "1984" might have looked like if it were made with the film technology of its' title (1984) but with all other technology limited to the year it was copyrighted (1949).  I hope that makes sense because I was bewildered by the amazing sets and, to a lesser extent, the special effects.  Yet I kept seeing the technology of my parent's era (and I'm 55).  As the movie went on I began to enjoy this retro-science fiction movie that shows the real and imagined dangers of the world Orwell tried to warn us about.  The over-welming bureaucracy, the signs of Big Brother everywhere, the paranoia of the opressed as well as the opressors, etc...  The story swims around in a variety of directions in a world where to think, say or do anything out of the ordinary becomes dangerous.  However, it may not be quite so bad given what passes for "ordinary" in this world.<br /><br />I admit to sensing a time or two that "Brazil" may be too long.  If so, I will likely prefer the Producer's cut rather than the 142 minute Director's cut I watched last night.  I had started by stating that I had heard of "Brazil" before.  After watching it, I can't believe that I haven't heard MORE about it.

As people go about their lives, almost no one notices something is seriously wrong with their world. Until one man wakes up alone, one fateful night.<p>John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a hotel room to find he's lost most of his memories. Even worse, he may have committed a string of brutal murders against local prostitutes. Fleeing the crime scene, he finds himself pursued by not only the police, but also a mysterious cabal of cloaked men. <p>Assisted by a cowed doctor and a supportive woman who claims to be his wife, Murdoch learns the truth of the city, and its secret Masters, the Strangers.<p>The feature actors all give strong performances, as a confused Murdoch and a supportive Jennifer Connelly as Emma. Keifer Sutherland is impressive, especially when you contrast the cowardly Dr. Scheber vs. his characters from &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; or &quot;24.&quot;<p>The sets are as compelling as the actors, and credit is due for the deliberate &quot;retro&quot; look of the city. Making of movie of this style look creative guts, and it paid off.<p>I just beg of the producers of the story one request: don't make a sequel, this story will always stand as a one and only!

Would you go to the police? Maybe. Would you go into hiding? Probably. Would you change your name and move to Russia? Why not? But would you don a dress and wig  and catch a train to Florida with an all-girls band? Well, that's what Jack  Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in this incredibly riotous and timeless comedy  from hit-after-hit producer Billy Wilder, and this is  his hottest hit! En  route to Florida Jerry, er, Daphne (Jack Lemmon) and Joe/Josephine (Tony  Curtis) encounter a ditzy ukelele player named Sugar Kane (it used to be  Sugar Kuvulchek) who moves &quot;like jello on springs!&quot;. Any guesses?  Of course it's Marilyn Monroe. And while Daphne is being whooed by an eager  millionaire (Joe E. Brown)Josephine takes on a third personality as a Cary  Grant imitating-upper class millionaire to impress an even more eager  Sugar! A fabulous script, (maybe even more fabulous actors!) and the  direction of Billy Wilder come together to make &quot;Some Like It  Hot&quot; a greedily enjoyable movie for anyone! Don't miss it and don't  worry: Marilyn never cools off for a moment.
 | product/productId: 630197820X | review/userId: A3SJSNS9LW981O | review/summary: Good, but not worthy! | review/text: Rocky IV is inspirational, as Balboa goes against the perfect fighting machine... and killer of Apollo Creed.<br /><br />BUT... what happened to the cinematic artistry of the first two films, and the unique, mindful story of the third?<br /><br />This film seems a "sell out" in so many ways.<br /><br />A cold war theme? Inappropriate.<br /><br />Two boxing gloves... one with the American flag, the other with the Soviet flag... colliding during the opening sequence? CORNY!<br /><br />An entire scene working as a "music video?" Rocky goes speeding around in his sports car like a criminal, the film flashes back through the first three films, all while a weaker song than "Eye of The Tiger" blasts from the screen.<br /><br />Pauli has a robot girl friend? Even the humor isn't as sharp anymore.<br /><br />The plot is basic... revenge. The movie works best when it's contrasting Rocky's Siberian wilderness training against Drago's "lab rat" training.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film is the most unlikely of the series.  I don't care how well Rocky has trained.... there's just no way he could or would overcome the steroid created monster named Drago. Especially with a "toe to toe" punch contest?<br /><br />Let us remember... Clubber Lang was "too strong" for Rocky to overcome with mere punching power. He had too be faster, more agile and more cunning.<br /><br />But with Drago... supposedly two to three times stronger than the average heavyweight... Rocky again falls back on the "powerhouse punch" technique of his youth. Drago makes mincemeat of Rocky at first, but Balboa's believably superior "heart" and "endurance" transforms the fight into a "street brawl." Drago delivers a head blow... then Rocky, then Drago, then Rocky... all while Apollo's trainer yells "Don't go down! Don't go down!"<br /><br />PLEASE. Why, oh WHY, couldn't this film capitalized on the lesson Rocky learned in the third sequel... and have Balboa overcome Drago through speed, dodging, footwork and agility? Instead, we have to believe a man half the size of his opponent overpowered the mutant.<br /><br />Not believable. Entertaining, but unworthy of the series.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."

The description on Amazon states this is the Special Edition which has the extra and frankly relevant footage cut from the theatrical. It doesn't.<br /><br />The audio is up to par but the transfer lacks the pop of a good session in the bay when it was done. Definitely tell this was not a "hands on" transfer.<br /><br />I don't remember if the original movie was 2:35:1 or not, but this Bluray version is 1:85. I know the rest of the series on Bluray is 2:35:1 so it's kind of a let down that it's missing from here.
 | product/productId: 1556587864 | review/userId: A1L8HRCM60W0W7 | review/summary: HOMICIDAL PARAMOURS, VOYEUR-EVER YOU LOOK | review/text: Your impression of this cult classic is probably bang on target, no pun intended. It's lurid. It's paced like a highway truck. With decent twists. Even grotesque ones. And it's embellished with grisly slasher scenes inspired by "Psycho", or perhaps De Palma's lacklustre "Dressed to Kill" if you include a certain elevator murder.<br /><br />You could accord several labels to its unabashed whodunnit moments wrapped in soft porn, but complexity would not be one of them. The plot isn't exactly a brain-twister, Hitchcock nailed this effectively in "Suspicion", about someone unwittingly getting entangled with a virulent maniac.<br /><br />It's the screenplay that scintillates. Smart and sexy, a little manipulative and very interchangeable, but it fashions itself for the purpose of its existence. Ultimately, it's less ham-handed than it is nonchalant about being such a disposable perk. The finale is admittedly a bit contrived but it works in that strange little way.<br /><br />Stone needs no introduction but my second viewing confirms that Michael Douglas pitches in a lot of 'hard' work too. Not sure if it's the indelible rear shots of him, or the ultimate range he proves in what could have easily been a third-tier erotic thriller.<br /><br />Fascinating rental for above eighteens.
 | product/productId: 0783225792 | review/userId: AA2OPN09LYNG7 | review/summary: Very Good But Not As Excellent As Goodfellas | review/text: Director Martin Scorsese reteams with screenwriter Nicholas Pil-<br />eggi for this examination of the rise and fall of a Las Vegas ca-<br />sino run by a slick mafia loan shark (Robert De Niro) and his violent hair trigger partner (Joe Pesci). Although the film is very good and Sharon Stone has good moments with her character, this film is not as excellent as GOODFELLAS (My all time favorite<br />mob movie) and GOODFELLAS is superior to this film and way better<br />than CASINO. The first flaw of CASINO is it should've been made by Warner Brothers, which made two other Scorsese mob pictures<br />MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS and if their ever was a collection of<br />Scorsese films they can add this to those films. Another flaw is<br />CASINO is not as enthralling and stylish like GOODFELLAS was. Another problem is Joe Pesci's character isn't as wonderful as his Tommy Devito in GOODFELLAS. Despite all this, it is still enjoyable to watch and it's screenplay provides all good details.<br />I am a real real big big Scorsese fan and has enjoyed all his movies and although CASINO is not my favorite Scorsese film to watch, it is still a good movie even though it is not a timeless<br />classic like GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, and MEAN STREETS, which are<br />better films. However I do like this one even though it is not a<br />masterpiece like GOODFELLAS was and GOODFELLAS is a way better movie than CASINO.

 | product/productId: 0800183428 | review/userId: A1UMH0DPGQHU18 | review/summary: Enjoyable stuff! | review/text: Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay make an excellent team! When they work together, explosions rock the screen, profanity is spewed between characters, and corpses far outnumber the amount of lines spoken. This is one of Will Smith's early ventures in film, and to be honest, I think this is his breakthrough role as Mike Lowrey, a playboy cop with a taste for gritty gunfights. Martin Lawrence is hilarious as Mike's partner, Marcus Burnett, a family man whose gig constantly interferes with his family life. Tea Leoni is okay, but not great, and her role seems a bit weird, as though it was just randomly stuck in the plot. The bad guy is a typical villain, with few lines and a thick accent. The action scenes are, of course, Bruckheimer-worthy, and so you wont be disappointed. The cinematography adds to the film's good parts. Overall, a movie that is fun, brainless stuff.

President James Marshall, to be exact. He's not only the president, he's a first class hero, as this story makes clear. Brief sketch, so as not to ruin all the surprises: there are dozens.<br /><br />Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.<br /><br />The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.<br /><br />OK, there's your tip of the iceberg. The rest is simply too unpredictable for me to want to spoil anything for you. See this film!

 | product/productId: 0767838963 | review/userId: A3T5NSG7LMRY0A | review/summary: A tech-noir treat. | review/text: This movie was right along the lines of what I was looking for. Lately I've been quite into the Neo Noir and Tech Noir genres. What I had hoped for in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K31V">eXistenZ</a>, but been disappointed, was realized quite smartly in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767821629">The Thirteenth Floor</a>.<br /><br />There's just enough technology used in the movie that it could potentially be considered "tech noir," but moreover it falls squarely into the category of "neo noir," playing with notions of identity, sanity, what defines 'humanity' or the 'soul' in a world of increasingly complex computer simulations made in our image.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the plot twists and turns. I'll simply say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I liked the style of the movie and some of the themes presented. I was relatively surprised by the ending twists, though I caught the gist based on a hint they placed just before the explicit expository sequence where it's all explained in some length.<br /><br />I give it an A+. I don't think it's quite fair to classify it alongside The Matrix, as they really are quite different movies. Though they do share a few themes, certainly (virtual worlds, identity, etc.). This is less an actioner than it is a stylized neo noir-ish mystery.
 | product/productId: 0780623150 | review/userId: AQ38OU6SRFGU5 | review/summary: "tune" this one in | review/text: This might not only the most underrated science fiction film but one of the most passed over movies of the past 15 or so years! Screen writer David S.Goyer ( Blade, Batman begins) Hits big time with a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing and has another great story line that is similar to the Matrix in the way that these people of dark city are oblivious that they are puppets in a bigger picture. The story begins with a man waking in a hotel room with no memory, which soon proves to be but one of many troubles. He is being hunted by the police, who believe him to be a serial killer, and also by a group of mysterious men with kinetic mind powers (their first meeting is very creepy). Furthermore, something appears to be wrong with the world at large: time, memory, and identity behave in unusual ways. The look of the movie is a combination of a film noir crime story and a great American science fiction film that has roots in gothic euro style of science fiction. The film has a great climax and ending that leaves you wanting to watch it again and again
 | product/productId: 0790729989 | review/userId: A20KV7USTFSHCC | review/summary: Huge plot hole in SEVEN | review/text: SE7EN is a very power film that relies on the shock of its chilling ending to divert the moviegoer from the gaping hole in the climax.  We know from the Sloth victim that John Doe has been planning this crime for over a year.  Yet we are to believe that he put all this in motion without having planned out the Envy and Wrath victims?  Certainly Doe could not foresee Mills' transfer and move.  Certainly he could not foresee that the detective assigned to his case would have a pretty young wife capable of making him feel envy.  The ending is contrived and unbelievable.  Sadly, this contrivance is there simply to make room for cliches... the retiring detective facing the case that changes his mind... the green upstart unwilling to admit his lack of omniscience... and the necessary convention of having the case become personal.  This necessity could have been achieved through better screenwriting while still avoiding cliches and plot holes.  The movie is powerful enough to distract most from the error, but reliance on shock over story is lazy.  There is no way that John Doe didn't have the entire design planned out well in advance... and no way he could have planned it around Mills in the story's current structure.

I had the VHS version of this and used to catch it when it was on Cine max back in the early 90's.  The story premise was the government were gonna use cyborgs to control a gang war zone ridden school.  The cyborgs were teachers that look human (just like terminator)and eventually go crazy and start brutally killing some gang member students.  This causes all out gore human vs. cyborg war.  Not like a Troma movie at all.  If you liked Chopping Mall and Terminator, this is not something you want to miss.

 | product/productId: 0790737868 | review/userId: A1QZGBMUGA2HVL | review/summary: Explores the possibilities of the filmic medium | review/text: I became aware of Terrence Malick's work as a filmmaker after being stunned by his 1998 epic &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;.  In tracking down the rest of his work I was both dismayed and relieved (financially) to  learn he had directed just two other films. &quot;Badlands&quot;, though  his debut, already is awash with his trademark style and may be his most  daring effort.  <p>That being said I don't think &quot;Badlands&quot; is a  film for everyone. Though the story is captivating and enjoyable, the  narrative is de-emphasized for complex themes and gorgeous visuals.  Malick  makes his points with incredible subtlety, perhaps even to a fault.  However, this makes &quot;Badlands'&quot; mystique only grow with repeated  viewings. The robustness of detail is absolutely mind-blowing.  Most  impressive is how Malick creates a paradoxical environment between the  images, sounds, and narrative. Sissy Spacek's naive narration is in direct  contrast to a relatively uninspiring romance we see.  Perhaps most stunning  is overwhelming trapped feeling the film evokes while being set in the  spartan, vast, and barren landscapes of the Great Plains.  These are just a  few examples of a film that endlessly confounds and intrigues. I rank it  with Chinatown and Taxi Driver as the pinnacle of US produced film in the  70's. If you want to explore the possibilities of film I can't think of  anything to recommend more highly.
 | product/productId: 6301797973 | review/userId: ANGH6401L9Y0T | review/summary: Mel Brooks Does Hitchcock, Possibly Better Than Hitchcock Did | review/text: Every Hitchcock fan will love this movie! Mel Brooks manages to sneak in a reference to all the most notorious (sorry!) Alfred Hitchcock movies you've ever loved. Just wait until you see what he does to The Birds! (Or rather what they do to him.)<br /><br />Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke (Mel Brooks) is the newly appointed director of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous. But he's got a problem of his own: high anxiety, which is used as the name for fear of heights, although the real name for that is . . . erm . . . agoraphobia? . . . anyway, several scenes from "Vertigo" are thus available.<br /><br />Chloris Leachman does villainous hags for Brooks better than anyone. In this one she is Nurse Diesel, the head nurse of the Institute and a most amazing character. I will not say more than to suggest that there's a point (sorry!) to her name.<br /><br />It turns out the previous director died under mysterious circumstances, officially designated suicide, but which Dr. Thorndyke's chauffeur and assistant Brophy (Ron Carey) is convinced was murder. And he suspects Nurse Diesel and Dr. Montegue (Harvey Korman) of being the murderers. It is well known that Montegue thought he would be named director after the death of the previous director.<br /><br />Medeline Kahn plays Victoria Brisbane, daughter of a wealthy industrialist who has been held at the Institute for a long time, even though she's certain he's "as sane as I am." But Dr. Thorndyke was introduced to a patient he was told was Mr. Brisbane, and the patient believed he was a cocker spaniel. Pitiful, but also extremely funny. When Thorndyke accidentally sees a picture of Vickie and her father, he realizes that the patient who behaved like a dog was not her father.<br /><br />The plot twists all over the place, the laughs come thick and fast, and I got a rather homesick look at San Francisco again. Specifically the Embarcadero Hyatt Hotel, which with its glass-capsule elevators running up and down the open atrium is just the place for a guy with "high anxiety."<br /><br />Just to minimize your high anxiety, it has a happy ending. Funny, of course, but happy.
 | product/productId: 0792845641 | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: LOL...popcorn? | review/text: Ok, so I watch a lot of stupid movies in order to fill a ballot of my personal awards that I pressure myself into making accurate and legitimate.  I'm a `lists junkie' and I feel the need to categorize and catalog what I feel is the best of the best.  It's like my own variation of ADD.  In that attempt, I often find the dumbest films in categories like `Sound' and `Visual Effects' because, well, it's hard to find a truly inspired film that uses those effects as a showcase.  So, while looking for films from 1991 to see, I stumbled upon `F/X2' and I thought, `I bet this will have some great special effects'.<br /><br />I was half right.<br /><br />One cannot expect the special effects to be as top notch as recent ones because, well, this is a 90's film.  The effects are going to be dated.  Sadly, in a year that brought us `T2: Judgment Day' and `The Rocketeer', I was expecting something bigger, bolder and better.  Instead, I got a slew of gimmicky effects and some stripped down action sequences that were cheesy and rather laughable.  I mean, I thought this was an action thriller, but beating someone up with a mechanical clown, while unique, wasn't exactly thrilling, and then beating someone up with grocery hams was downright hilarious (in a bad way).  The effects towards the end get better (when there are actual explosions) but the tense scenes are overrode by terrible acting and dialog ("what if I made a copy"...intrigued mean face..."did you?") to the point where the film just isn't interesting; like, at all.<br /><br />Thankfully Brian Dennehy is charismatic and holds our attention for a while, but the obviousness of this film is bland and the overall impact is extremely poor.<br /><br />And honestly, what is this film's obsession with food?
 | product/productId: 0790734427 | review/userId: A2G8IR6ENZSQHF | review/summary: A great start to the franchise | review/text: &quot;Batman&quot; stands as an example of how to make a good comic book film.  Above all, the film is just oozing with atmosphere, and &quot;Batman&quot;'s look is undoubtedly its #1 strength.  However, it also has some thrilling action sequences, a terrific villain (perhaps too good- see below), and, most importantly, a good man in the Batman suit.<p>The film belongs to Jack Nicholson- he is probably the real main character of this movie.  He makes the Joker both a funny and menacing character, and he gets all of the best lines.  This was a role Nicholson was born to play, and he enjoys it with relish.<p>Michael Keaton was the best Batman, in my opinion.  OK, so he is a little short, but no one else played the Bruce Wayne part better than he did.  He makes this a Batman to root for.  If only we saw more of him...<p>Which brings me to the film's main flaw- this is the Joker's film the entire way, not Batman's.  Why the filmakers decided to do this I don't completely understand, but it takes away something from the film.  We never really get to bond with the superhero in this one (this was somewhat remedied in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;).  Also, Kim Basinger's character is mainly eye candy and pales in comparison to future Batman girlfriends.<p>Nevertheless, I really do like this film, and I get caught up in its atmosphere every time I watch it- it still looks good 14 years later (although some of the Gotham backgrounds were obviously paintings).  This is largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who mostly understood how to handle Batman and his universe- he was the best man for this job.  He gets help from a great score by Danny Elfman and terrific designs by designer Anton Furst.<p>I would recommend this to all comic book fans, as it stands as an example of both a great comic book transition and of good filmaking in general.

From what I've been told by some of my old skippers, this is how minor league baseball really was; smoking, drinking, fighting, women and a true love of the sport. I love the characters and how each contributed to the movie. Peterson was fantastic, Madsen was good, Pen (or Teller) was great, and the rest of the characters were fun to watch. I get a smile on my face from the beginning to the end. I find it hard to describe just how fun this movie is to watch. This movie really "smacked the rawhide out of the confines". And excuse me "if they can't take the joke".

I actually enjoyed the way it was handle in some respect, but the movie needed more of a kick to really grab me into it and needed to give a better platform to its actors. I love Gene Hackman as an actor, and I thought that he did well in his part, and Dustin Hoffman gave him a really good adversary. I liked Rachel Weisz a lot as an actress, and she really gave one heck of a performance. I think she actually stole the movie from everybody with what she did, that how good I think she was. And John Cusack was as cool as ever.<p>I just wish that the movie were as good as their performances.

 | product/productId: 6301562925 | review/userId: A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S | review/summary: A great edition for a forgotten horror movie | review/text: Michael Myers (Don Shanks) returns a year later after being shot to pieces in a cemetary and buried in a mine shaft to pursie his niece (Danielle  Harris. This installment into the Halloween series was panned by quite a  lot of critics and recieved quite a bit of abuse from a number of Halloween  fans. This movie is not as bad as it has been credited. It still has plenty  of scares, thrills and action for any horror fan. This DVD edition was a  great tribute to the all the fans of the Halloween series. The edition that  I have looked at is the limited edition. This means that it comes in a tin  case and contains a 48 page booklet whcih contains some really good and  rather interesting photos. The DVD itself is presented well. Although the  movie was originally going to be THX Mastered, the picture quality is still  very clean, not showing any signs grain or wear and tear, and the audio is  a very well presented 5.1 Dolby track which really adds a loud slicing  sound to the pumkin cutting in the opening credits. The extras are a very  short introduction by Danielle Harris and Elle Cornell, a very interesting  documentary with interviews with Director Dominique Othenin-Girard,  Director of Photography Robert Draper, Don Shanks, Danielle Harris, Elle  Cornell and Executive Producer Moustapha Akkad. It also contains a trailer  which looks more like a TV Spot than a theatrical.  It would have been good  to see a commentary track by Dominique Othenin-Girard, Robert Draper, Elle  Cornell and Danielle Harris. But overall its a very pleasing treatment of a  very under-rated horror film.
 | product/productId: 5550195054 | review/userId: A1B9ISLYYCHIVE | review/summary: Lower it into the burning pit. | review/text: Ah, the old Curmudgeon Spidey-Sense.  Never fails. As much as I loved the two Terminator movies (first one especially), I had no good feeling about Terminator 3. And whaddya know? I was right.<br /><br />First of all, the new female Terminator is RUBBISH. They really had shot themselves in the foot creating the T-1000 for T2, because there was no way they could ever have created something more intimidating, more of a genuine, unstoppable threat, than Robert Patrick's. And even though the T-X is 1000 times nicer to look at, she is nowhere near convincing enough. And Arnie's Terminator isn't the same either. It's a lame reprisal of a role, and whilst the jokes in T2 worked, here they grate (they just HAD to have a gay bar in, didn't they?)<br /><br />This wouldn't be so bad if the original movies weren't so good. It's not as if this is some tacky sequel to a B-movie. But it not only tarnishes the originals, it makes them POINTLESS. Basically, "uh, yeah, all that stuff that happened in the first two movies, all the lives that were snuffed out, that was for nothing anyway. Sorry."<br /><br />Inexcusable. Pretend it doesn't exist.<br />(...)
 | product/productId: 6302414016 | review/userId: AAD2DYRK43BYF | review/summary: Wonderful Documentary Is Even Better than the Actual Movie | review/text: Shot by Francis Ford Coppolla's wife, Hearts of Darkness is an incredible, one hour fifty minute documentary that reveals the horrors of making the very popular Apocalypse Now.  The film took forever to make, driving many  of its participants to the brink of insanity, not just Coppolla, who was  emotionally-unstable for much of the film.  Viewers of this fascinating  documentary will be amazed to learn that Harvey Keitel was originally cast  as Willard, but was dropped after only two weeks of shooting.  Though only  36 years-old, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming, an event  that further postponed its debuts in theaters.  There is some really great  footage included here, especially the shooting of the opening sequence of  the film which involves a very drunk Sheen lashing out as both his  character and himself (at that point, Sheen was experiencing a lot of  hostility towards Coppolla and had it out with him right then and there, an  episode that would appear in the finished movie).  Even if you didn't  particularly care for Apocalypse Now, you will most likely find Hearts of  Darkness interesting, nonetheless.  It is a magnificent look at the  troubles and triumphs of a film crew headed by a somewhat mad, but  brilliant director.  This shouldn't be missed.

 | product/productId: 630197803X | review/userId: A3VIOCJZ22JZXT | review/summary: Time casts a harsh light on this film | review/text: When produced, this film was probably dazzling and exotic. Handsome Sean Connery plays the Arabian prince, full of bravery and daring. Candice Bergin plays the American beauty, elite in her social class but a strong mother with an impeccable character. Brian Keith plays the frustrated President Teddy Roosevelt, forced to make hard decisions that are in the best interest of the American people while showing compassion for the kidnapped American millionaire and her children. The coastal scenery is lush and the desert scenery bleak but beautiful. The story is one of romance where East meets West and all parties turn out to be honorable and heroic.<br /><br />So why is this movie problematic in 2009?<br /><br />This film was made at a time when white characters were shown to be intelligent, brave, and industrious when compared to persons of color.  Therefore the Arabs in the film are depicted as clownish. There is a scene where the kidnapped family fights Arab bandits and an American child is able to fight the bandits and win. This seems odd. The Arabs are portrayed to be corrupt and their hereditary leader is portrayed as a cartoonish clown. Sean Connery plays the part of the uncle of the Arabian ruler, called the Raisulis, now involved in a rebellion of sorts. But it is never clear what the rebellion is all about. We never understand why the Raisulis kidnaps the American woman and her two children. Brian Keith does the best job in the film playing Teddy Roosevelt. But the blunderbuss gun-boat diplomacy practiced by the Americans is portrayed in a positive light.  The conception of the United States' diplomatic players and their abilities as a bunch of gun slinging, wild, cowboys is out of date. It may have been entertaining in 1975 but current world conditions reveals this drama to be stereotypical in a disturbing way. Paul Bowles' Sheltering Sky is a far more sinister but accurate account of West misunderstanding East.

 | product/productId: 0767844688 | review/userId: A8SSX9KX9UIKS | review/summary: "JOAN OF ARC" THE MINISERIES IS WAY BETTER | review/text: I agree with most reviews of "The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc." While Mila Jovich, or however you spell her last name, is an AWESOME actress, (she was in "Return to the Blue Lagoon" and all three "Resident Evil" movies) I'm sure that this portrayal of Joan is very inaccurate. In this movie she is portrayed as a screaming, annoying and lunatic b****!! What the hell was the director thinking? He or she clearly did NOT do thier homework. I have seen the 1999 miniseries of "Joan of Arc" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the "Joan of Arc" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in "The Messenger" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries "Joan of Arc" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake. And I believe that "Joan of Arc" is as accurate as any film could possibly get about the "the flower of France."

 | product/productId: 0767837479 | review/userId: A1AISPOIIHTHXX | review/summary: Probably in my top 5 favorite films ever | review/text: Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great example of a film doing away with conventions and making a compelling and even magical film that you can't imagine being made today. When it comes down to my top 5 favorite films ever, this tends to interchange with E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Whereas that film is still touching and more emotional, Close Encounters is filled with a visual splendor where the images are made to show us the wonder of things that can happen. Despite Spielberg's claim that it's the one film that "dates" him, it's still arguably one of his best, even in light of Schindler's List or Jaws.<br /><br />Roy Neery is a blue-collar family man who, while on the job, has a strange encounter with a craft with bright lights in the sky. The experience ends up changing him and pretty soon he becomes obsessed with it and one particular image which causes much trouble with his wife and kids. Elsewhere, a frenchman named Mr. Lacombe and his interpreter Laughlin are finding strange things around the world such as planes and ships in the desert and a curious 5 note melody. All of this ends up tying together in the end as everyone discovers something life changing.<br /><br />In the days of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, one thing that was never lost on Spielberg was making even mundane scenes interesting. From radio traffic controllers encountering something strange to Lacombe showing the famous hand signals matching the musical notes, nothing in this film seems wasted. Which of course makes the completely memorable images all the more striking such as Roy's truck going haywire, mother Jillian getting unwelcome visitors in her house to seeing just how massive the final ship is compared to the mountain, this film never feels like it just lags.<br /><br />One of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go "well...thought it would be cool" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.<br /><br />Is it as exciting and popcorn fun as Jaws? Or as serious and character driven as Schindler's List? Well no but that's beside the point since this is a film where you're almost glad something that feels this against the grain exists.

 | product/productId: 0783225792 | review/userId: A2GYX971VETQBV | review/summary: An Interesting Glimpse of the Mafia and Vegas | review/text: I must be blind.  I just don't see what everyone is talking about.  CASINO is not (and let me emphasize "not") Scorsese's masterpiece.  I don't mean to say that it is a bad picture by any standards, but there is much more depth in Scorsese's catalog than comes to life in this film.<br /><br />CASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.  The story, while based on a true account, is not an unfamiliar one to filmgoer's: the tale of two men that get catapulted into the riches and glamour of money, drugs & sex, only to be chewed up, spit out, and left for dead by the business that once supported them.  In the process, they destroy all of the relationships that are near and dear to them and wind up where the story begins.<br /><br />It may seem that I am giving too much of CASINO's architecture away.  But, Scorses wisely employs the audience in this classic storyteller's technique, informing us from the very beginning about where the story will end up (as witnessed by the car bombing of De Niro's car in the opening sequence of the film).  Moreover, and this I was less thrilled with, De Niro provides a layer of dialogue that is peppered throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I did not feel that the dialogue was effective.  Rather, it served to prevent us (in some ways) from getting wrapped up in the storyline and gave the first thirty minutes of the film (where the dialogue is most obtrusive) a bit of an "amateur" feel.  After all, how tragic can the story be with De Niro providing his own reflective commentary.<br /><br />All of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.  The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.  Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.  Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.  However, my recommendation would be to watch GOODFELLAS first, as I believe it is a superior film.

The disk is single layered, meaning that at this movies length they (Warner Brothers) couldn't fit the whole movie on one side of the disk. You have to flip the disk over mid-film!! <p>Granted it is not the end of the world but it is an inconvenience that a DVD need not have. A DVD is capable of containing two layers per side. Each layer can roughly hold about 2 1/4 hours of high-quality video, audio and subtitles. So, then, each side of a DVD is capable of storing over 4 hours of footage. This means that each DVD can have over 8 hours of material.<p>Longer movies like &quot;Brave Heart&quot; can fit on one side of a DVD and still have space for a &quot;Making of...&quot; Documentary and lot more Bells &amp; Whistles then offered here. <p>I have gone over every symbol and every line of text on the package and find no warning of the &quot;Mid-film Flip&quot;. Because of this I am not going to buy another Warner Brothers DVD. <p>If I can not trust the company then my money will go elsewhere, and I suggest you do the same.

Everyone has at least heard of his famous thrillers "Psycho" and "The Birds", but most people have not heard of his less famous movies like "Rope." In "Rope," a planned murder, followed by a sick party, demonstrate Hitchcock's usual twists and surprises. With one small exception, the story itself does not contain Hitchcock's long, gore-filled, and disturbing scenes. One big problem with the film is that it is adapted from a stage play. Many movies have been adapted from plays, however, they have usually been expanded on because of the greater resources that are available in the film genre such as multiple, more complex scenes. Hitchcock ignored the fact that he was making a movie and decided to basically film a stage play. The movie was filmed in what is called "real time." "Real time" is where the entire movie seems like it is filmed as one scene. This bores and forces the audience to see the not so important and sometimes tedious actions or the film and causes distractions. The movie also lacked good music and sound affects to add to the suspense and drama of its scenes. As for the selection of characters, some seemed to fit the parts, while others did not. Hitchcock is known for his famous camera work in the movie "Psycho" where he employs multiple camera angles. In "Rope," the camera comes from the same point in the room and at the same height and angle the entire time which contributes to the audience's lack of interest. Overall, the movie was boring to watch and a waste of money to buy. If you're looking for a good Hitchcock movie, your money would be better spent on "Psycho" or "The Birds." But then some say Hitchcock takes pride in being different from the rest. "Rope" certainly sets itself apart from movies of that period and without question to the movies of today. Most people would consider it a timeless classic, however I don't agree.

 | product/productId: 0780619870 | review/userId: A3KMTOFTUUNFHG | review/summary: Crash into Me, Baby! | review/text: The ridiculous made into the sublime!  CRASH takes a fetish that thankfully does not exsist or is not too popular - the car crash as sexual release and expression.  The movie becomes an allegory for the dangers of sexual obsession - especially when you detach from people.  None of the characters here can connect, and again you have a very literal expression of not being able to merge.  DAVID CRONENBERG has been mining this material for years, and Crash is probably his most successful effort to date!  It's a hard movie to watch.  Slow-paced, breathless line delivery, and eye-popping scenes of sex and violence.  The cast is top-notch -- James Spader, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette, and Elias Koteas all turn in subtle and over-the-top performances simulatneously.  But the stand-out to me has always been Deborah Kara Unger playing Ballard's wife.  Sexy as hell, remote, and erotic -she holds the key to this car.  Like a real car crash you can't take your eyes off it.

Historically this is a film that would/should show up in a film class at college.  The story is unique, the acting and accents are authentic, and there are some really good scenes and quotes.  The colorization is very good, but I still wish that DVDs would include an option to watch in black and white like the original.
 | product/productId: 078401020X | review/userId: A1AISPOIIHTHXX | review/summary: Good movie, great sex and tons of Sharon Stone | review/text: Oddly enough, Basic Instinct to me is in the same league as Jaws and Psycho: something from the film literally impacts the culture. How many times have you gone swimming and hoped a shark wouldn't come? Or whether somebody's outside your shower curtain? And of course we always hum their respective themes, whether we're going after someone in a pool/lake or making a stabbing motion with that irritating-but-effective high pitched Psycho theme. Well add silk scarves and icepicks to the list.<br /><br />Detective Nick Curran is investigating a case of an old rocker killed in bed while tied up and repeatedly stabbed. Their trail leads them to his "girlfriend"(a.k.a a **** buddy) Catherine Tramell, a novelist. Interestingly, a character in one of her books is killed in the precise manner as the rocker. So is someone framing her, or does she know that people would think she's nuts for killing someone in the exact way she wrote it obviously naming her the killer?<br /><br />Then Nick starts to get obsessed. The sexually charged presense of Catherine affects him, making him smoke in non-smoking buildings and even having rough sex with his girlfriend. He also has to deal with Catherine's girlfriend(and not in the "girl and she's a friend")Roxie, who's quite jealous. So the question becomes is Nick dating the killer he's looking for? Or is Catherine's lover a little too obsessive?<br /><br />The film was extremely controversial when it first came out. Not only for the sex filled narrative but also the "treatment" of gay and lesbians. Some gays and lesbians aren't crazy? We're not always that idealic view that we have. In a special feature on the Desperate Housewives set, Felicity Huffman recalls the scene where a woman asks "isn't it great being a mom?" Well yeah if you don't factor in the sleepless nights, frantic running around and calling for babysitters and housework. Same idea here. Sure Roxie is slightly off and a bit obsessive but isn't some of them? Like Norman Bates said, we all go a little mad sometimes.<br /><br />Now the sex in the film is never explicit. We don't see anything that'd get the film NC-17 but it sure implies a lot. We got implied oral on male and female, standard positions, tons of nudity and even some girl-on-girl lesbian kissing(sorry guys, no love scene with those 2). The unrated version just merely extends shots by a few seconds or changes the camera angle, such as Nick and Catherine's first sexual encounter.<br /><br />As for extra features they're not bad, including one feature that shows what was cut out(which really needs to be implemented more in these unrated editions). The commentaries are ok except you might find famed feminist author Camille Paglia a bit irritating since she's so university-lecture and overemphazing things. For example here's something she mentions about the interrogation scene: "The intensity of looking in this scene, looking on the part of the men, on Catherine's part, on our part, raises the temperature in the scene. There's a kind of sadism as Catherine plays with her prey. There's a kind of evocation of great movies about St. Joan, where in this case, the perverse saint, a Mary Magdalene figure, is defying her interrogators." Um, lady it's just a scene.<br /><br />Watch it with your spouse than get incredibly nervous when you decide to have your own frolic.

 | product/productId: 0792838068 | review/userId: A4X5UMTUQZB7I | review/summary: A brilliant movie... | review/text: I have never been more impressed by a movie, particulary because of some serious alcohol problems of my own. This movie helped me overcome these problems, by reminding me what drinking can do to a person. Not only does  Nicolas Cage brilliantly portray the hopelessness and despair of the  character, he also shows the indifference and selfishness of an alcoholic.  Any one who has seen the movie must have had moments, where Ben looked like  a nice caring guy, only to hear him say something harsh and resentfull  later on. This kind of conduct strikes me as very characteristic of  alcoholics, and because of this exeptionally real approach towards  alcoholism i felt compelled to express my opinion about it. I would like to  know if Nicolas Cage did his acting sober, because if he did, he knows his  job. In my opinion he must have explored exessive drinking at some part in  his preparations, his performance was just too convincing.

 | product/productId: 0790720434 | review/userId: A3EPUERFG6YK31 | review/summary: Magic, Love, & the Importance of Family | review/text: The Secret Garden is a movie I watched as a child and even now I watch and love every moment of it.  This movie is by far the most accurate that I have seen, particularly the casting director's attention to description detail.  The acting by the children in this movie is impressive considering how young they are, their emotions freely expressed on screen when needed or bottled up to show the control they have over them.  The soundtrack is stunning as well, masterpiece of piano, guitar, and string instruments.  Sometimes it will be the same song used save for a different instrument playing the melody which changes the mood drastically from the others.  The settings as well are simply stunning and the director's use of light and shadow help to show the progress of Mary's love for the home and those in it.  The themes of the movie are clearly stated.  The acceptance of death and the remaining love that allows those left behind to heal, even if they didn't feel they needed healing at all.  A touch of magic which some have misinterpreted as witchcraft, which in reality is most Collin's desire for his father to stop running away from what he has.  A fantastic movie and worth watching over and over again.
 | product/productId: 630241332X | review/userId: A4UKBG3M5U5TI | review/summary: "I wanted to be just like you in every way I could." | review/text: "All Fall Down" stars Warren Beatty, in one of his earliest roles, as Berry-Berry Willart.  Berry-Berry is a womanizer and perhaps worse, yet he's idolized by his parents (Angela Lansbury & Karl Malden) and kid brother, Clint (Brandon de Wilde).  When Clint visits his brother in Key West, he finds that Berry-Berry has been arrested for roughing up a prostitute.  He bails out Berry-Berry and heads home to Ohio, where his overbearing mother and alcoholic father badger him.  Berry-Berry eventually returns home, to the delight of his family, who obviously manage to overlook his flaws - some would call it denial.  When an attractive family friend (Echo played by Eva Marie Saint) comes to stay with the family, things start to build to a (very predictable) climax.<br /><br />William Inge (Picnic, Splendor in the Grass) adapted the screenplay from a novel by James Leo Herlihy (Midnight Cowboy, Blue Denim), and John Frankenheimer (Manchurian Candidate) directed.  The main cast has an amazing 11 Oscar nominations among them, and Brandon de Wilde is very good here.  Of course, he seemed to specialize in playing idolizing youngsters - he perfected it in "Hud" and "Shane."  With this pedigree and cast, "All Fall Down" should have been a classic, but it ends up a mess - although a somewhat interesting mess.  There are a couple of problems with the movie, starting with inconsistent characterizations.  In particular, Angela Lansbury's role begins as a clich&eacute;d overbearing mother, but then she abruptly becomes endearing, before ending as a deluded screecher.  These variations didn't feel natural or organic and didn't seem to reflect actual changes in the character - it was just bad writing.  In addition, there's no build-up in the big dramatic scenes; it almost seems as though scenes are missing.  As a result, I didn't feel any kind of investment in the story or these characters.  Yes, the characters are sometimes quirky (the father is a communist and Clint eavesdrops on people and obsessively records their conversations in a journal), but these quirks don't contribute much to the final product.<br /><br />I somewhat enjoyed "All Fall Down," as I often like melodramas from this period.  However, this genre is much better represented by "Splendor in the Grass" or just about anything by Tennessee Williams.  "All Fall Down" is best viewed as second-tier material with some interesting actors saving it from obscurity.

 | product/productId: 0767809335 | review/userId: A3PQQ8L5R5H01R | review/summary: Fantasy par excellence! | review/text: Fantasy (in film) is apparently a dirty word.  I do not understand why.  Of all the people to whom I showed or recommended this film, only 3 enjoyed it.  Normally, we (those with whom I would discuss films) like the same stuff.<br />  Ah well.  This is one fantastic film.  Baron Von Munchausen, historically real and mythologised, was/is the world's greatest liar.  So, the story opens with a theatrical cast in a dilapidated theater, in the midst of war and shelling, putting on a play about the life of the baron.  The real Baron walks into the theater, and tries to set the story straight.  Then he, in his explanation of the reality as he sees it, illustrates for us, in real life, what was portrayed on stage, but on a much grander scale, to most magnificent effect; not to mention the added adventures that are woven-in.<br />  I first saw this piece on video in the mid nineties.  Now, post September 11th horrors and excess, the story has added resonance.  The antagonists of the story are bureaucrats who believe they represent the fullest expression of Reason in life and government.  They have everything compartmentalized practically and rationally, including the days on which they can shoot at the enemy, and the enemy at them.  And they can't accept that the war eventually has been won. "Don't open the gates!"<br />  And then there is the fantasy:  A balloon made of ladie's silken underwear, a flight to the moon.  The king and queen of the moon (the king is Robin Williams) with their detachable heads to pursue intellectual pursuits while their bodies...  A sea monster...  the spectre of death...<br />  The story is well told, the cinematography beautiful, the dialogue witty and compelling.  There are enough layers to keep the viewer from being lazy, and yet, one doesn't have to stare at the screen and lay heavy on the rewind to understand the film.  Just  watch it.<br />  The Baron, on one of his many death beds, laments that the world has gone to Reason and science, and has no room for "cucumber trees", and indeed, there are too few yarns so imaginatively told on film these days.  This is one of them.  A great afternoon flick, or something for after the bars,when it's still too early to go to bed.

It's two halves of two good films edited together, and they don't blend _at all_.  In one half, the comedy sidekick bounces across housetops on his bicycle with no harm done and all the bullets miss our heroes; in the other, the hero, angst-ridden since the death (debatably, murder) of his son, ends up in a traffic-stuck ambulance dying graphically in blood and agony.<p>Oil and water would look positively emulsified by comparison.<p>But it's an _interesting_ film, especially for the type of people who like to argue over issues like creators' moral responsibility toward their characters.  ("...I don't really like you.  You've brought me nothing but pain."  -- J Slater to A Schwarzenegger)<p>I grant that the animated cat does not belong in the picture at all.

 | product/productId: 6301231902 | review/userId: A3RX54RU8R8OMH | review/summary: Powerful and intense noir movie | review/text: The opening scene of this movie is justly famous; Frank Bigelow (the excellent  Edmond O'Brien)walks into a police station saying he wishes to report a murder -his own.The movie then goes into flashback mode and we witness the events that brought about his predicament and his tracing of the killer.It is a clever story and kudos should be bestowed upon the writers Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse for the ingenious plot .<br />Bigelow is murdered while in LA attending a convention and the modus operandi is the covert administration of a poison for which there is no known antidote .On being advised that he only has a short time to live he devotes his time to identifying the killer .The journey takes him into the seedier side of LA and Frisco bringing him into contact with the dark side of American society.Dark in this case can be taken literally as events unfold mostly at night or in darkened rooms<br /><br />The photography by Ernest Laszlo is moodily effective and the score is quite exceptional but then it is by Dimitri Tiomkin ,so what do you expect?<br />O'Brien is rarely absent from the scren and he does a superb job of holding things together displaying what an under-rated actoer he was .Pamela Britton as his secreatry and confidants is fine and the debuting Neville Brand (playing a psychotic killer and hired muscle)is compelling .Watch out too for another debutant in Beverly Campbell(later Garland) and Luther Adler in another of his splendid slimeball turns .Rudolph Mate's direction is exemplary<br /><br />In my view this movie has been slighly over-rated down the years and I dissent from the view ,often voiced ,that it is the best film noir ever .It is certainly the most unusual and  that counts for a lot.So ,while I  believe it is not quite as good as its reputation it is still  a hypnotic and propulsive movie that deserves repeat viewings
 | product/productId: 630021463X | review/userId: A3EY1CA1C5PCNF | review/summary: The Star Trek Movie Even Grandma can like and understand! | review/text: First the DVD review: Like the other ST Films re-released in a special 2 disc set, this one is PACKED with extras! Thank you Paramount! DVD features an excellent commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner who share alot of insight into the making of this wonderful movie, original interviews from 1986 featuring Shatner, DeForest, and Nimoy, a trailer, some great featurettes on the making of the film and the spfx, storyboards & gallerys, a very poignant tribute to the late Gene Roddenberry (the creator of ST) and Mark Lenard (Sarek, Spocks father), and something not mentioned in the Amazon DVD features section called the "FuturesPast: A Look Back". This is a half hour documentary which features new interviews with some of the cast, crew, and producers! Very neat stuff! <p>I say this is the ST even your grandma can enjoy because it is very light and entertaining. I agree with Nimoy when he said it was time to "lighten up" the series a bit and have some fun with it. Star Trek The Motion Picture was very serious (not for ST Fans with weak minds or an acute case of ADD though), ST II was also serious as we dealt with a bad guy bent on revenge and the death of Spock, and ST III Kirk lost his son and the Enterprise was blown up. <p>I am a BIG believer in originality when it comes to movies. Unfortunately this movie is not original. It blatantly steals the story of ST The Motion Picture (Alien probe of unknown origin is threatening the Earth and has to be communicated with in order for it to go away) and it capitalizes on a very popular storyline back in 1986 and that storyline is Time Travel. You had to be there, but back in 1985 a little movie called Back to the Future came out and it was a monster hit. So in 1986 Hollywood, of course, came out with another Time Travel hit called Peggy Sue Got Married. So it is no surprise that ST IV was influenced with this premise. I hate to admit it, but it works great for ST IV! I usually look at un-originality in storylines with skepticism and sarcasm so when I went to see this in the theatre I was expecting the worst. What I found was a very fast paced, funny (of all things) ST movie that is universally recognized as the "best" Trek film! <p>I personally would never classify this movie as the greatest Trek film ever made, to do so would clearly label me as a shallow person because of the stolen premise, but it ranks very high on my list! I love the fact that this movie has an underlying current of Eco-Awareness too. The humor in seeing the original cast in modern day San Francisco is funny as well. <p>I was fortunate to see this movie in the theatre back in 1986 with a sold out house! The experience was awesome! Sitting on your couch and watching this movie pales in comparison to seeing it in the theatre with 100 or so other fans! Each joke was 10 times funnier!<br />Note to Paramount: Hey, Paramount, how would you like to start a trend? Why don't you dust off these original cast Star Trek Movies and re-release them in the theatres? I would definitely go see it! (You would have to charge a discounted rate though because nobody will pay $10-$11 to go see what they have on DVD!) I want my kids and newer fans to know the experience of seeing these movies on the big screen again! TRUST ME, Paramount, people would flock to go see these movies! Clearly the American consumer is not flocking to anything that Hollywood is putting out nowadays.<p>OK, yes, there are TONS of funny and quotable lines in this movie. Personally my favorite happens in the beginning of the movie when Spock first boards the Bird of Prey ship, wearing a big white robe, and apologizes to Kirk and says "I seem to have misplaced uniform". Yes, hearing Kirk and Spock curse later on is funny but that ironic line is just classic!<p>Remember, there are VERY FEW must own DVD's and this is one of them! Get it before it goes out of print!

Oshima was being very political by challenging the Japanese censorship laws (and showing pubic hair), but in his haste to show us more than any other mainstream movie ever dared (or cared), he failed to invest the film with the life of its time and of its characters, who were supposedly real people once upon a time.  It's a tawdry excuse for showing explicit sex - even if the couple enjoyed a hypertrophied sex life.  And alot of the dialogue is unintentionally risible.

That sensation which remains in your mind and your soul , a must reference and above all, it becomes an unforgettable memory in your brain.<br />The film is full of tension; claustrophobic, dramatic and powerfully haunting. The sequences of action are very well made; the script is very related to the book.The cast is outstanding. The handle of camera is BREATHTAKING, the camera is a sliding eye, nervous, it retains the anguish, the hopeless and that deathly taste you feel when you share the destiny of these man under that huge water pressure.<br />That film broke the walls of the standard market and soon became from 1982 in a classic film.<br />The question about if this film is anti war film is out of discussion. I don't think even if this issue is important. You must feel the evil experience of these men sent to a almost safe death in a sea surrounded by enemies forces.<br />Watch this movie.<br />And you'll understand why U-571 even his special effects is just a worthy tribute to Das Boot, the masterpiece of Wolfang Petersen.

Based on Tom Wolfe's amazing book, the movie is a visual stunner with a top-notch ensemble cast.  Sam Sheperd stands out as Chuck Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier.  He portrays Yeager as a cowboy who flies jets instead of riding horses. Mr. Sheperd gives a cool and impressive performance.  Ed Harris first sprang to attention with his performance of John Glenn.  He gives a gentle and passionate performance and the scenes with his wife (who was hearing-impaired) are touching.  Fred Ward gives a blustery and gruff performance as Gus Grissom who appears to be on the verge of cracking after his space launch goes awry.  Scott Glenn adds a touch of humor to film as Alan Sheppard the first American in space.  Dennis Quaid is brash and cocky as Gordo Cooper.  The Right Stuff is a must DVD as its sound and picture are enhanced by the format.

 | product/productId: 6301606892 | review/userId: A21B2TJBWCSK1R | review/summary: Not without its flaws... | review/text: Casualties of War came out towards the end of the trend of Vietnam War movies in the 1980s after the likes of Oliver Stone, Stanley Rubric and others had tried their hand at it. By the time Brian De Palma's film came out the public had grown tired of this sub-genre and, despite glowing reviews from critics, Casualties did not perform as well as hoped at the box office. The theatrical version wasn't quite the cut that De Palma would have preferred and this new "Extended Cut" presents his original intentions.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox was primarily known as a sitcom actor and for a string of lightweight comedies (Teen Wolf, The Secret of My Success, et al) but the underrated (if not flawed) Bright Lights, Big City hinted at a capacity for drama that he showcased to greater effect in Casualties. Fox does a nice job of conveying the moral dilemma that his character faces. He is the film's moral centre and the one we are meant to identify with. His scenes with Penn have the requisite intensity with Fox wisely underplaying to Sean Penn's over-the-top Sergeant.<br /><br />Penn plays the obvious villain of the film and is a real monster. You can see it often in the psychotic gleam in his eyes. At times, his performance veers into caricature as he lays on the New York accent a little too thick and his grotesque facial expressions are a little too garish to be believable. That being said, one has to admire his fearlessness as an actor to play such a truly unlikable character.<br /><br />Penn (and the rest of the cast) are let down by David Rabe's screenplay. He has essentially written a morality play but it resorts to broad strokes when shades of gray would have been much more effective (as in Mystic River which showcased Penn's talents much more effectively). Rabe does a good job with the relationships between the soldiers and how the younger, more inexperienced ones are subservient to the veterans because that is their right - they've earned it due to their experience in combat. Casualties of War is a flawed film but a visually interesting one as is customary with De Palma's body of work. He expertly uses the entire widescreen frame in many scenes showing off his command of composition. It's a shame that the content of the film wasn't up to the same quality as the style.<br /><br />This new "Extended Cut" runs six minutes longer than the previous edition and mixes some of the deleted scenes from that DVD and some original footage never seen before.<br /><br />New to this edition is "Eriksson's War - A Conversation with Michael J. Fox," an interview where Fox talks about how he got involved in the film and what attracted him to it. This is an excellent interview with the actor as he recounts several good anecdotes.<br /><br />"The Making of Casualties of War" largely features De Palma talking about the movie. He had wanted to make it since he read the original article in 1969 but the opportunity to film it did not present itself until he was able to parlay the success of The Untouchables.

Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn play two elderly people who go up to there cottage on Golden Pond to spend a summer. over the course of that trip, they befriend a lonely boy, evaluate there lives, and forge a relationship with there daughter (Jane Fonda). all the performers are great but the two standouts are Fonda and Hepburn. each one plays a foil to another, Fonda as Norman, is a crochity, wise cracking, disputible old man whil Hepburn as Ethel is a gentle, loving, all around caring person who acts as the peacemaker. when there both on screen, they are dynamite and both richley deserved those oscars. also, when both Fonda's are on screen they each show that no mater what they both love each other. a truley great film that will just leave you feeling great, On Golden Pond is recomended for anyone who loves movies.

Now, 20 years later, and amid the mediocrity that characterizes most (but, fortunately, not the totality) of the films made during the past 30 years, I appreciate Novecento even more. Obviously, like every masterpiece, this film has its own demands: do not expect an easy-going film.<br /><br />The impressive photography; the well chosen cast (except, perhaps, DeNiro which I never considered as good an actor as most people do); the film's intent... are some of the features that convert Novecento in a gem.
 | product/productId: 0800130189 | review/userId: AGMWB74FSVMH8 | review/summary: Where is the masterpiece? | review/text: I'm in the middle of those who say it is terrible and those who say it is a masterpiece.  Certainly, 25 years of movies and (I assume) imitation can make it seem less of an impact film.  But it is very slow.  It has only one dramatic moment (the climax).  The character is inexplicable many times.  The script is so minimal that I sometimes wanted to yell- "say your line already!!"<br />Of course DeNiro is good but I don't see the part as one of his most demanding.<br />But Cybil Shepard is drop dead gorgeous!!  Her eyes are worth the rental fee alone!
 | product/productId: 0790731533 | review/userId: AYPCUQS6ARWFH | review/summary: Roger Nelson at his best! | review/text: I was in college during the time that "Purple Rain" wahsed Michealmania (Jackson, that is) to the side for a while in 1984. Musical scenes aside, the story is cornball by modern standards. But the MUSIC!---WHOA!<br /><br />The DVD extras are well done. I recall the concert footage of "Baby I'm A Star/I Would Die 4U" with the James Brownish jam session at the end (with Shiela E, who doesn't appear in the actual film, on the drums) airing frequently on MTV during the purple reign of the Summer of 1984. This is Prince onstage at his best, and is comparable to the performance scenes in the film. The MTV movie premire footage (also from 1984) is quite bizarre, with a young Eddie Murphy and a middle-aged Little Richard saying "Prince is me in this generation."<br /><br />It would have been great to have the deleted scenes that the trailer alludes to included, but what appears is just fine. Must give credit to Morris Day and the Time for adding needed comedy relief in this film. He and the Time are still shouting SQUAWK HALLELUJAH on stages across the country.<br /><br />BTW, while you should get this and all of Prince's albums from 1978-87 (well, "Diamonds and Pearls' was his best post-Sign of the Times" work), hold your noses and STAY AWAY from the films "Under the Cherry Moon" and the even more senseless mess "Graffiti Bridge." YECCH! This was unquestionably Prince Roger Nelson (his real full name)'s best film.

 | product/productId: 0792839846 | review/userId: A2R6RA8FRBS608 | review/summary: a great film with so much memorable dialog | review/text: Casablanca is one of the most essential films you should watch and own in your DVD collection. Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more. It's also a story about people suffering in the most desperate of times during World War II when The Nazis were occupying many countries and even had a presence in North Africa where this film takes place. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent. In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see the French Moroccan town of Casablanca where refugees from Nazi Europe come in the hopes of getting a high priced, black market exit visa to Lisbon--and from there, America. An expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca where they serve up the drinks and the local Vichy government official Captain Renault (Claude Rains) turns a blind eye to the illegal gambling there--just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette! At the same time we also learn that two German couriers have been killed--and the two exit visas they had have been stolen by an unknown thief. The Nazis are fast on the hunt for this man, whom they believe to be a big resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo has been a tough enemy of the Nazis; he even escaped from a concentration camp!<br /><br />One night Victor and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enter Rick's caf&eacute; hoping to buy those two precious exit visas from a character simply named Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed--but not before he slips the exit visas to Rick for some "temporary safekeeping." Eventually the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) confronts Victor and his wife Ilsa in his office with Captain Renault; but Strasser will only let them out of Casablanca if Victor rats on other leaders of the resistance movement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating--and this aspect of the story gets pretty hot, too. It seems that just before the German occupation of France, Rick and Victor's wife Ilsa had a brief love affair. At the time, Ilsa thought that Victor was dead and so she didn't think she was cheating on him. However, Rick gets a huge shock. Just when Rick and his sidekick Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) are about to leave Paris for safer ground along with Ilsa, Sam hands Rick a note from Ilsa telling him they can never see each other again and she doesn't even say why. But now that Rick sees Ilsa is married to Victor, Rick finally knows why Ilsa dumped him. But wow, he is upset and angry anyway! He still loves Ilsa; and she loves both him and Victor in her heart of hearts.<br /><br />Although it may seem that I've already written too much, I already left out some juicy details to the plot to keep you interested up to this point. And, of course, this is all very heavy stuff--how will it all turn out? Will Victor be trapped by Major Strasser and the other Nazis and be unable to leave Casablanca? Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick? What ever does happen to those exit visas that Ugarte gave to Rick--does Rick hold onto them or will he sell them to the highest bidder and get out of Casablanca himself? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The single DVD version of this movie doesn't have too many extras; but you will get a half-hour documentary entitled "You Must Remember This" which is both hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. We do get outtakes but they are included in this documentary.  In addition, I believe that if you buy the two DVD edition of this film, you get a much longer (almost 90 minute) documentary about Humphrey Bogart's career also hosted by Lauren Bacall. The two DVD edition has commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Casablanca is a "must-have" movie with outstanding attention to detail; the story is practically guaranteed to have quite an effect on you. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well.

It is a set piece, a very restricted musical, but it is still fun. I don't think there is another movie quite like it. The costuming and sets look really good on our large screen TV. The musical itself is a glimpse of a past farther back--the 1900s--than the glimpse of the past--1962--served up with 2010 technology. Cool.
 | product/productId: 1558908358 | review/userId: A32T2H8150OJLU | review/summary: The birth of digital candy...and it's a classic | review/text: I watched this DVD again last night, just to see if it was only my memory recalling some of the "good old days" or to see if this really is a classy and classic film.  Well, it turns out that it was NOT just my selective memory thinking that this was an awesome show!  It is a classic bit of sci-fi and movie-making history.<br /><br />I recall the first time I saw TRON.  I saw it at a matinee when I was in college.  I told my friends about it...I went back again that night, and to the matinee again the next day.<br /><br />This movie represents a great example of the genesis of computer animation for full-feature films.  It was originally released in 1982, and now, 27 years later, it is still extremely watchable, though the special effects are extremely dated - even so, I still think that the disc games and the light cycles are the coolest!  The light cycle game has even resurfaced in a game called "Light Bike" that came on my son's iPod touch.  Take that detractors!<br /><br />One of the things that made this film memorable was not only its computer graphics, but it was released in the hey day of video game arcades.  The joint experience of this movie and the phenomenon of classic video arcades made for a memorable experience.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, well, the acting is marginal, but the story line is intruiging, and, at the time the computer graphics were mesmerising.  All in all this is a keeper, and I'm glad I have my own copy.<br /><br />When I watched it last night was, however, the first time I'd watched this DVD on a big screen TV (50" 720pi plasma).  I found that the image was at times a bit grainy, so that was a little distracting, but not significantly so.<br /><br />So, all in all I award this DVD 4 stars.  If you remember hanging out in video game arcades, the launch of MTV, and you are any kind of sci-fi fan at all, then this is a must-have product for you.

But it deserved a far better DVD transfer then Fox gave it. They chose to cheap out on a very good soundtrack and pass on a DD 5.1 upgrade, leaving the original (VHS) Dolby 2.0. The film transfer is at times grainy and no better than VHS, in fact we compared it to the tape and found it about the same.The film was transferred to a 2.35 wide screen format. The only &quot;extra&quot; was the original trailer. Fox was certainly after the quick buck on this conversion. We give the film 5 stars for its entertainment value, but 0 for it's DVD technical merits. I guess that makes it a 3 overall. Michael Douglas/Robert Zemekis how could you let Fox do this to your film.

 | product/productId: 6302215927 | review/userId: A1UI21TOBFCY86 | review/summary: Still relevant | review/text: Reviewers have described the basics of this court drama. This is a very thought provoking piece, that will linger in your mind long after you are through it.<br />I found myself thinking on Brothers Karamazov, the chapter of the "Grand Inquisitor". On this chapter, Ivan Karamazov is telling his younger brother the tale of the Grand Inquisitor: Jesus Christ returns to earth on XV century Spain; when he performs the miracle of resurrecting a child, the multitude is applauding him and then Inquisition arrest him for heresy. In his cell, the silent Jesus is confronted by the old Grand Inquisitor, who reproaches the Lord about placing an unbearable responsibility upon mankind: that of free will. Nothing is more attractive but more terrible to man that free will, meaning the choice -well, not only the choice, but the moral obligation- of discerning by oneself what is wrong and what is right. The Grand Inquisitor protests than only a few man and woman, the Saints, the Chosen few are capable to take such burden. All others, the ordinary, common man, would gladly resign to exercise free will to follow the lead of anyone offering miracle, mystery or authority.<br />Watching the trial against Captain Wirz, and how he emotionally melts down by the end, I couldn't stop thinking he is not an evil monster but one of those "ordinary souls" willing to override his own free will for that of his military superiors.  Faced to the atrocities of the camp he was responsible for, his only way to justify or excuse himself for his decisions is to convince himself and the jury that he had no choice but to obey.<br />Also, since this is a moral question more than anything else, is the authority of the tribunal valid enough to judge this man? Being the victor authorize you to judge a defeated man in an environment full of hatred?<br />These and more questions make this drama still relevant today.<br />The production is very effective; it has the sense of intimacy and immediacy of a small theater venue. The acting is uniformly superb; seeing Richard Basehart on the final sequence is almost painful to watch; you are so involved on the play, that at no time you are thinking this is an actor doing a good job; it's only captain Wirz's final attempt of justification.<br />Thoroughly recommended, especially for theater lovers and people interested in American history

 | product/productId: 6300167151 | review/userId: AYO34VP4DE46R | review/summary: Prudhomme Does It Again!! | review/text: Always being fascinated with the cuisine and culture of Acadiana I had to try this VHS...even though many don't even have VHS' anymore.  I had my lifes favorite meal at K-Paul. (his blackened Drum)  As a result Chef Prudhomme has always been on my radar.  I strongly prefer the cuisine of southwest louisiana to new orleans so I would make my jambalaya without tomatoes .... but just watch his very basic gumbo.  I had a great chicken & sausage down pat .... he definitely opened my eyes to a new technique ... he makes his roux from the oil he fried the chicken in while browning.  I just wish he had more videos.  The cuisine of Louisiana is so unique and learning from someone like Prudhomme or John Folse is definitely a treat!!!
 | product/productId: 076780192X | review/userId: A39C2BQXZHOUMJ | review/summary: Best Blu-ray presentation I have seen yet. | review/text: This is a revised review of my previous...because I need to echo once again how amazing this set is.  Bluray is such an incredible, versatile, and exciting format.  Close Encounters is the kind of transfer which is why I bought a BD player to begin with.  It contains all three versions of the film, so if you're partial to one, it's here.  It has been so meticulously remastered that it looks like it came out last year.  It was like seeing it for the first time, every detail from the knick-knacks in the Neary home to the detailing on the alien craft are rendered beautifully.  Each film has 2 lossless sound options, which is almost unheard of.  A DTS-HD MA and a Dolby True HD 5.1.  I prefer the DTS, but both are very powerful.  Not only does it feature house-rattling bass, but ambient and directional effects are exhilarating.  Dialogue reproduction is crisp and spot on.  Simply put, it will never look or sound this good again.  It was restored from the original source.  This was the first of Spielberg's oeuvre to be released and the follow-up have not been disappointing.  "Minority Report" is a revelation, "War of the Worlds" and Saving Private Ryan" ...all of these are demo-worthy, reference grade transfers.<br /><br />The price has dropped on this set dramatically even from when I wrote my original review.  It is still one of my go-to discs to demo my blu-ray, so people can see what the format can do for a film that is 33 years old!  I cannot wait to see "Jaws" and "A.I." added to the repertoire.  Close Enounters is not just a movie, but an experience.  It reminded us to look at the stars with awe and wonder and dream of the possibilities.  The story is expertly crafted and still relevant and relatable.  The fact this transfer is so spectacular makes it a new experience with all the awe and childlike wonder flooding back to me.  A must own for fans of the film and fans of blu-ray.
 | product/productId: 0800141601 | review/userId: A29E6IO3DZG6IY | review/summary: Lovely, romantic and entertaining. | review/text: I found this version refreshing and surprisingly good, despite the odd casting of Richard Gere as Lancelot. I thought he'd be too modern and American for the part, but he does very well with it.<br />Of course casting Sean Connery was inspired, Julia Ormond, whom I usually dislike, was good here and Ben Cross is perfect as the villianous Malagant.  The supporting cast of knights, courtiers, handmaids and denisons of Leonesse are all good as well.<br />This version has no Merlyn, no magic or witchcraft, though the Christian elements remain. It is made simpler and free from the usual intellectualized symbolic interpretations, taking the story out of the realm of mysticism and into clear human reality.<br />The principle characters are well developed, even the sets correspond perfectly to each character, and there is palpable sexual tension between Lancelot and Guinevere.  Also, in this version, Guinevere never actually consumates her relationships with Lancelot or with Arthur, as on their wedding day, she, Arthur and the kmights are called to rescue her homeland of Leonesse. Hence, this is a more idealized love story, but still has great cinematic appeal.<br />There's wonderfully written dialogue, excellent cinematography and editing, crisp night scenes, beautiful music, intricate costumes (her's - but not so much for the men), lovely sets (though Camelot is rather Hollywood looking) and Malagant's ruin of a black slate rock 'cave castle' is awesome.<br />My only criticism is how easily Malagant takes over Camelot during the city gathering, since apparently no one thought to guard the city gates.<br />Still I found it well done and entertaining, for general audiences. I recommend it.

 | product/productId: 6300270440 | review/userId: A25AXWGBGJ5KBS | review/summary: Awesome talent on display. Just awesome. | review/text: There is no argument. Prince, in 1984, with the "Purple Rain" juggernaut mowing down records at the box office, the record charts and the concert halls, was awesome. Watching the film again, a film I had memorized in my youth, renewed my appreciation for his prodigious talent.<br /><br />And what balls this guy had! Barely into his twenties, with one moderately successful album (the double "1999") behind him, he ventured into the film world.<br /><br /> He's in nearly every frame. His name's above the title. It is autobiographical in tone. It's essentially a musical, with each song propelling the plot and supplying storytelling information.  It was a rock musical, to make matters worse, as they were (and still are) not known for being huge money-makers.<br /><br />Yet from the opening frames to the climactic ending, you are absolutely hooked. One hundred percent.<br /><br />If you are not, then you MUST have something against him, or against rock in general, or in musicals...<br /><br />Seriously, the incendiary "Let's Go Crazy" with his Hendrixian squeals and pogo beat, is as good as any filmed musical performance ever.<br /><br />Somebody argue with me, I dare you.<br /><br />The editing, the cinematography, the energy, the precision...it's the closest a film has come to reproducing a true live experience. And Prince owns every inch of celluloid here. His personality radiates right off the screen.<br /><br />Each song advances the story so well, the dialogue is kept minimal.<br /><br />Many critics point out some hackneyed lines and stilted performances, faulting the entire movie because of them.<br /><br />They're partially correct. There are a few lines that STILL make me wince, even when I know they're coming. Many of the supporting actors/musicians sound like they're reading out of a phone book.<br /><br />Not Prince though. Not once. He feels authentic. Even the logistically stupid things he does (mostly with a motorcycle) or the stylistically questionable things (mostly his wardrobe) somehow manage to work with him. And him only.<br /><br />Apollonia is a vision, but she shouldn't sing.<br /><br />Morris Day is a hoot on stage, but some of his off-stage antics don't work.<br /><br />I will say that Jerome is perfect. I just love his presence.<br /><br />There is a hint of misogyny on the part of many men in the film, but I think that's part of the plot. I think Prince's redemption at the end of the film includes a new respect towards women. Using Wendy and Lisas song for "Purple Rain", singing "I'll never beat you" in the song "I Would DIe 4 U" to Apollonia, kissing Wendy on the cheek during "Rain" all indicate a change of heart.<br /><br />Anyways, that ALL pales next to the concert footage. While he's chastising Apollonia from the stage using songs like "The Beautiful Ones" or the infamous "Darling Nikki", or exorcising demons in "Purple Rain", he is a master artist. Captured on film. I don't think I've ever seen the joy of performing emanate so clearly from an individual in a film. The performance is a kinetic drug working on Prince, and we watch the side effects.<br /><br />I can't believe he wrote "When Doves Cry" overnight, on command. I can't believe they shot all the concert footage in ten days. Total. I can't believe this raw talent that we fortunately captured on film. He'll never be like this again.<br /><br />The (literally) climactic encore of "I Would Die 4 U" and "Baby I'm a Star" (referring to the guitar neck bit at the end) is Prince proudly announcing to the world he has arrived. Who else, in the title and chorus of the last song, could state...could proclaim that he is a star, and we in the audience can do nothing but nod in agreement.<br /><br />Now, the DVD itself, this new 20th anniversary version, is a revelation. Over the years, I bought the record, then saw the movie, then went to the concert.<br /><br />Then I bought the VHS tape.<br /><br />Then I bought the CD.<br /><br />Then I bought the laserdisc.<br /><br />Then I bought the DVD.<br /><br />Now, I got this sucker, and this one rules them all. The picture, finally letterboxed, is gorgeous. Crisp, colorful and detailed. The sonics are pristine.<br /><br />The extras are pretty terrific too. The mini-docs on the First Avenue club, and on the making of the film itself, are interesting enough. The puff piece on the "influence" of Purple Rain is OK, but they don't go really into any serious detail.<br /><br />The biggest laugh is the footage from MTV's Premiere coverage. Pee-Wee Herman, Eddie Murphy, Sheila E., Weird Al, John Cougar Mellencamp (the best speaker of the bunch, by far), an odd appearance by Little Richard, the painful fashions, the worst hosting and interviewing you'll EVER see...<br /><br />...oh I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />Add on those precious, uncut videos (and a running commentary a little too slow for my taste) and you have a five-star DVD. No question.<br /><br />Catch a glimpse of a star hitting supernova. It's right here. And it's awesome.

 | product/productId: 6300216268 | review/userId: A2UUWETDYA2EKV | review/summary: A Hippie Manifesto | review/text: Harold and Maude is neither the cinema's greatest movie, nor is it the worst. Instead, it is a highly original, quirky black comedy that combines inventive characters  with a devastating attack on the pillars of America's Establishment. It's no accident that Harold comes from a conformist upper-class family, over which mom presides lavishly, but like a petty demeaning tyrant. Nor is it happenstance that Maude's origins lie outside a youthful US, in an older, more experienced Europe devastated by the death-dealing Holocaust of which she is a survivor. Hers is understood as a life-affirming perspective that has been earned, and stands as the perfect antidote to the zombified Harold, whose soul has shriveled in the midst of repressive norms and repressed instincts. Probably no movie from that rebellious era captures the counter-culture's positive image of itself better than this one. Nor are the forces in conflict more sharply and humorously drawn than the encounters with organized religion, psychiatry, the military, and other of America's domineering institutions. Even at age 80, Maude represents the pure flower child riposte, showing that age is no barrier to affirmative values, while Harold overcomes alienation by at last responding to enlivening people rather than deadening duties. In capsule, we have both the class origin and universal ambitions of that insurgent period, when suburban white kids sought to lead a global parade that would break the shackles that bind us. H&M celebrates that spirit, and while I grow a bit weary of Ruth Gordon's unrelenting girlishness and Harold's hollow-eyed deadpan, they do remain unique and compelling figures. As does the movie, even 30 years later.

He later finds out she is actually a witch, sought after by a murderous coven. She appears to have "Samanthitis" - that is, a witch falling in love with a "muggle", as it were (see Bewitched). They appear on several occasions attempting to reintegrate her into the cult. Among them, is a "Mrs. White", a kindly grandmother who harasses and frames him.<br /><br />He eventually seeks the aid of a survivalist with the likely name of "Brock", who operates a veritable compound, but is no match for the power of the cadre of cultists. Seems he received the brain blender treatment. Despite all of their desperate attempts (including her Magic), they cannot fully fend off the evildoers who consistently prove to be far too clever and potent at every turn.<br /><br />He begins hallucinating as they appear to him; in one remarkable scene, a Warlock levitates his little Porsche, bursting out the windows. He finally visits the stately mansion where they congregate, and is attacked by a Martial Artist cultist; also displayed therein, an impressive ritual chamber decorated with a Sabbatic Baphomet on a wall, and a pentagram upon the floor. As he flees therefrom, he finds his little car torched.<br /><br />Finally, in search for his dream girl, he arrives at a beach during a ceremony where he is lured to be the night"s "sacrifice" (who had to come forth willingly}. A discernible The Devils Rain influence is detected here. Thus confined, the final scene contains some very interesting and rather impressively unexpected twists,  surprisingly without the demoralization process typical of these presentations. The cult prevails herein, and the chain of events continue...<br /><br />The film has a rather "made for TV" vibe at times, but can be quite engaging nevertheless, really picking up when the resident Witches and Warlocks begin their nefarious influence upon his mind. The movie does have some cult value overall, and holds the drama well.

 | product/productId: 0800185269 | review/userId: A1V4HZ2I5SD5YV | review/summary: there once was Arab glory | review/text: When I first saw Lawrence of Arabia in 1962 I was 26 years old.  I knew very little about the history of WWI or the Arab Middle East.  Nonetheless the movie was riveting.  Now seeing it again at age 70, with some accumulated  knowledge of both subjects, it is truly spellbinding. This has to be one of the greatest films ever; perhaps, the greatest.<br /><br />Whatever one's political persuasion about the present turbulent Middle East and The West's role in it, one can gain a feeling, an insight into the people and region from this film that simply cannot be conveyed in print.<br /><br />The modern media images we have of Arabs today are either fat, bloated Saudi royals, ragged street people in a rage, insane suicide bombers, or down-at-heel scrofulous politicians.  We hear of a time when there was an Arab "glory" but it is unimaginable given the present sorry state of the Middle East.<br /><br />It's difficult to conceive of physically fit, courageous, self-reliant Arabs, not merely surviving, but thriving in their natural environs; the vast and unremitting desert.  The film imagery of the agile camel rider Omar Sharif and the robust horseman Anthony Quinn is stunning.  This is a new perception, that of Arab as athletic, splendid-looking and master of his domain.  Sharif as warrior/dreamer and Quinn as warrior/strongman, in the best roles of their lifetimes, will forever change your image of "the Arab."<br /><br />I've nothing to say about Peter O'Toole's quirky portrayal other than it doesn't interfere enough with the rest of the production to keep this from being the great movie that it is. I think a perfect companion read would be David Pryce-Jones, "The Closed Circle: An Interpretation of The Arabs." HarperCollins 1991.
 | product/productId: 0800185226 | review/userId: A2EIAFTUF35196 | review/summary: A true modern masterpiece | review/text: I highly recommend this film not only to fans of historical drama but for a truly well-made film. This 1966 winner for Best Picture is stellar in every respect; each craft delivers its best work and the acting is first rate.  Paul Scofield won the Oscar as Best Actor in his first major screen role.  Sadly we don't have nearly enough Scofield film work to preserve for posterity.  Paul preferred stage acting and while I can understand his preference I mourn the fact that this great actor can't be seen in more films.  (See him in the Burt Lancaster film "The Train" from this same decade) But this outing shows his power and range as Sir Thomas More who became Chancellor of England for Henry VIII, and died for standing by his deeply felt moral principles.  Some say the film is so good because it wasn't a high priority production for Columbia Pictures and they left director Fred Zinnemann and company alone to create.  I don't know if that's the case but it has many historically correct touches.  Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey uses genuine sheepskin parchment with a real quill pen as well as an exact duplicate of Wolsey's official seal. The ax used in the execution scene is authentic from the period.  "A Man for All Seasons" won six Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture.  It features an excellent period musical score by George Delerue and the backbone of any film, wonderful writing by Robert Bolt who also won an Oscar.  Even the smaller roles are expertly played...look for a young John Hurt and the wonderful Leo McKern.  Vanessa Redgrave shows up in an  uncredited role as Anne Boleyn.  The story of Sir Thomas More is taught in every high school and is well known.  This production shows how movies should be made, with quality at every turn and a wonderful story to tell.<br />  This edition has a special feature included on the life of Thomas More.

 | product/productId: 6301562143 | review/userId: A2TXR85WQLE32N | review/summary: Batman, Revived... | review/text: 1989's "Batman" was rightly a cinematic hit.  Directed by Tim Burton, it features a dark and brooding storyline, amazing sets, a well-chosen cast, and an update on the technology traditionally associated with the Batman character.<br /><br />Michael Keaton was a surprising choice as the Dark Knight, by day a weathly philanthropist, by night the Caped Crusader.  Keaton's touch is to portray on-screen, and successfully, the motivation of a scarred childhood that drives Bruce Wayne to create and live through his alter-ego, Batman.  This Batman fights crime in a black rubber and kevlar-armored suit, using a variety of gadgets to come and go from crime scenes.<br /><br />Batman's opponent in this film is the Joker, played with over-the-top maniacal evil by Jack Nicholson in an Academy-Award-nominated performance.  The Joker is a gangland hood who survives betrayal and an industrial accident on a job, emerging as the deformed and now insane master of crime in Gotham City.<br /><br />Beautiful photojournalist Vickie Vale, earnestly played by Kim Basinger, becomes the object of desire of both men.  Their parallel story arcs will intersect in her person, who is kidnapped by the Joker and must be rescued by Batman, in a spectacular finale set in the bell tower Gotham Cathedral.<br /><br />Burton's superb direction takes full advantage of the brooding, spectacular and vaguely retro sets; if this movie has any fault, it is that scene, mood, and setting tend to overwhelm the characters.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as excellent entertainment for fans of the Batman franchise.  Its success sparked three lesser sequels, with Valmer Kilmer and George Clooney taking their turns as Batman while being crowded off the stage by their respective villians.

 | product/productId: 079284632X | review/userId: A2RNTG686ZATNP | review/summary: Good Story, Terrible Acting!!! | review/text: Wes Craven's film debut, The Last House on the Left, is a disturbing movie to say the least and was a movie that crossed the line. The movie can be considered scary because the type of crime committed in the film is a realistic possibility anywhere. The Last House on the Left is disturbing and shocking. Four convicts escape from prison and hide out in an apartment building. When 2 young girls Mari Collingwood(Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis Stone(Lucy Grantham) go searching for marijuana in the wrong place they run into the convicts and are tortured, raped and left for dead. It preceeded "I Spit on Your Grave"(1978) which seems to have stolen many of the same ideas from Last House but added much more nudity and excessive brutality. <p> My problem with this movie however is the acting with one exception. If you do view this film you will see what I mean. Marshall Anker and Martin Kove(The sheriff and the deputy) give the most [horrible] performances I've ever seen unless these cops are supposed to be ... clowns. Gaylord St. James plays Dr. William Collingwood, besdies seeming disconcerned about his daughter's disappearence it takes him about 5 minutes to kill the lead convict Krug Stillo(David Hess) with a chainsaw. The only notable performance in my opinion was that of David Hess who was excellent as a maniacal, conscienceless, cruel psychopath.<p> The Last House on the Left is without a doubt a ground breaking film and one you won't soon forget. It will get a reaction from you whether it be positive or negative which I believe was Wes Cravens goal in this film. Give it a look and form your own opinion.
 | product/productId: 078401003X | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: The Labyrinth of the Human Heart | review/text: Few films have so consistently defeated expectations, both on and off the screen, as Neil Jordan's 1992 THE CRYING GAME, a dark and darkly humorous tale of terrorism, guilt, revenge, and the vagracies of the human heart.  Producers disliked the script, which they considered both uncommercial and impossible to cast.  Filmed on a shoestring budget, it was expected to go nowhere fast--and then became the most talked-about film of its year, alternately fascinating and outrageing audiences and critics around the world, nominated for and winning numerous awards, and going on to become one of the top grossing films of its year.<br /><br />The film is extremely difficult to discuss because to do so undermines its power for a first-time viewer.  In a general sense, it concerns IRA terrorist Fergus (Stephen Rea), who is involved in the kidnapping of English solider Jody (Forrest Whittaker.)  Soon Fergus finds himself pursued by the English as well as the IRA, which feels he has betrayed them; he hides himself in the crowds of London, where he is attracted to Jody's girl--the elegant Dill (Jaye Davidson.)  But the more Fergus tries to avoid danger, the more it swells around him, threatening to engulf both Dill and himself.<br /><br />I first saw THE CRYING GAME in its theatrical release and came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it.  It was a remarkable experience because each time I became convinced I knew what the film was about I was wrong: the story, the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography took an unexpected turn and proceeded down a completely unanticipated path.  Although I was impressed, I wondered if the film would be as effective on a second or third viewing--but although the movie is filled with a host of twists, it is not superficial; it does indeed hold up to repeated viewings, for each time one sees it one becomes aware of additional nuances that one missed before.<br /><br />So what, ultimately, is THE CRYING GAME about?  It is an extremely difficult film to define, but in the end I think it is about the nature of love.  We cannot predict who we will love, who will love us, or what the outcome of that love will be--but even though we may struggle for it or against it, love drives us with a powerful force into situations and conclusions that we may not have anticipated in our wildest dreams.  THE CRYING GAME is the labyrinth of the human heart in all its glories and follies and disconcerting effects.<br /><br />The collector's edition of the film comes with numerous bonuses ranging from an alternate ending to a documentary on Ireland's troubles to various "making of" features.  All are worth watching; most interesting, however, is director-writer Neil Jordan's commentary, which covers many aspects of both the film and his career in general.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
 | product/productId: 0790745011 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: G-Men | review/text: After solidifying his reputation as Hollywood's number-one bad guy, Cagney played a straight-edge lawman in this gangland drama, a huge hit for Warners and great publicity for J. Edgar Hoover's fledgling department, which had only recently granted officers the right to bear arms (a big plot point in the film). Cagney is mesmerizing as Brick, prudent and principled but also tough as nails and willing to throw his weight around. His two love interests, a bar-girl-gone-wrong (Ann Dvorak) and hospital nurse (Margaret Lindsay), land him in a tangle and also help amplify the theme of divided loyalties. Cagney is at his riveting, entertaining best in "G Men."

 | product/productId: 6301810678 | review/userId: A2EEUYJ5DPWRV0 | review/summary: 1 star is too much for this movie... | review/text: It's bad - really, really bad.  If you are able to get past the early 80's haircuts, uniforms which don't look quite right, Civil War battles that look they were fought by maybe 30 people, and painfull to watch overacting, then there is still the writing.  Stacy Keach's character for example, had dreams in which he predicts the future (you hear about them throughout the movie - somehow Keach is able to deliver his lines with a straight face).  Hard to believe someone wrote this movie on purpose, harder still to believe that someone thought it was a good idea.  Save your money and get Gettysburg instead, or make your own movie with sock puppets, which will still be much better than The Blue and the Gray.

There are better choices for Disney movies from this era, like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
 | product/productId: 0788833073 | review/userId: A21279TEPJ8YJ9 | review/summary: Excellent Girl Flick! | review/text: I love this movie!  I loved reading the book.  Bridget is a single and in her thirties.  At a Christmas dinner, she is set up by her mother with a childhood neighbor Mark Darcy, who is bitter after his divorce.  He doesn't do much to make Bridget to feel welcome.  She thinks that he is too uptight for her so she persues Daniel.  Daniel, who has an appetite for women, is impressed with Bridget.  They go out until she finds out that he is engaged to be married.  What a terrible surprise!  That is the turning point for Bridget to get herself together.  And she does.  She gets to know more about Mark and does like him.  <p>Mark put a shield around himself because of what happened to him.  He used his job to avoid having fun in his life.  Colin Firth did a good job portraying his character as he did in "Pride and Prejudice".  Hugh Grant was sexy in his role as Daniel.  And the other characters were just as good portraying Bridget's family and friends.  <p>This is a good movie for any single woman.  As single women, there is a great deal of pressure from the marrieds as to why we aren't in a relationship or even married.  Some of us are trying to get a life of our own before even giving up a life that we have yet to explore.  I am still single and have no qualms about it.  The people on the outside may have a problem with it.  But so what, that's their problem!  And Bridget Jones's Diary sets the record straight.

What i want to get into is the Blu-Ray transfer. To sum it up in one word: grainy. It's obvious that the transfer was straight from the original film negative. You see all the lines and pops that would have been present on screen when the movie originally came out in theaters. I'm positive there will eventually be a remastered version coming out but who knows when that will happen. It definitely needs a good digital clean up. Audio quality is also lacking. It is just standard Dolby 5.1. They could've at least made it PCM. Really, if you get this at a good price, there is no reason NOT to buy it. The picture isn't bad. It's just not up to par with other Blu's out there. Still a great addition to add to the collection.

 | product/productId: 6302336562 | review/userId: AJ5LC25EE6XJ7 | review/summary: Black Robe | review/text: I thought this Canadian film about a Jesuit Priest in Quebec, was a brilliant piece or work.  It takes place in the 17th Century when the Roman Catholic Church is making it their project to convert the natives to the "true faith."  But<br /><br />the natives, while unsophisticated, have their own religion and view the black robes in many cases,  as demons.  Most reviews suggest a similarity between this film and "The Last of the Mohicans."  I'm not sure if that is accurate; each film stands out on its own fine story line and "Black Robe" seems less Hollwyood than the latter.  A good film if your in the mood for a natural environment and a true portrait of life in the New World.  There is some violence and some natural sex; I would not reccomend this for young children.
 | product/productId: 5553798159 | review/userId: ATIRJ2ERWIXJ8 | review/summary: Now if only the ninjas were interested more in fighting and less in invisibility... | review/text: If you're looking for ninjas, you'll love the opening credits... and not much else. The movie opens with a Shaolin monk being randomly attacked in the forest by a team of ninjas. Not a bad way for any movie to start! Following this attack, the ninjas disappear. For the rest of the movie.<br />What can I say? The acting and dialogue through which the viewer must drudge in order to get from fight scene to fight scene is horrible and awkward, but what Kung Fu movie fanatic hasn't paid their dues in this respect? The problem with this movie is that the the dialogue/acting are worse even than one might expect. It gets to the point where it's distracting, you know? Also, I think the male lead... MIGHT have down syndrome... Nothing wrong with that, of course. It's just a little surprising to see in a Kung Fu movie.<br />Still, the fight scenes themselves are fairly well done. The choreography doesn't quite stand out, but the enemies against which the Shaolin brothers are pitted, including ghost-and-zombie type dealies as well as masked attackers, make for some colorful fights.<br /><br />In summary:<br />Don't get too excited about the ninjas, it's a trick. Skip past anything that isn't a fight. Make your own story!

Actually, I am glad I never twigged 100%, I would have missed out on the thrill.<p>When this film starts off and Nicole Kidman is interviewing people for the servants' jobs, I thought &quot;what a nutter&quot;, locking all doors, no light in rooms where the children were to be, the kids couldn't run about, not allowed outside etc etc etc, however, this just added to the superb storyline.<p>This film had never appealed to me, I only watched it because my own daughter had said how good she thought it was - I am glad I heeded her advice because I thoroughly enjoyed it too.  It does not make you jump, but it does keep you interested - creepy scene when her daughter is playing with the string puppet in the attic though.<p>Great film with a superb ending, I definitely recommend this one.
 | product/productId: 6301302982 | review/userId: A2EEUQ81DTY7G3 | review/summary: "We should have used our imaginations" | review/text: Skewering her real life role of a pin up girl, this 1944 movie stars Betty Grable as Lorry Jones a pretty and feisty young girl who works for the USO and is heading for Washington DC. Aboard the train, a conversation with friend Kay (Dorothea Kent) reveals that the pair isn't headed for the USO, but will instead take jobs as stenographers.<br /><br />On the way, the pair decides to visit New York, where they see Molly McKay (Martha Raye) flirting with Guadalcanal hero Tommy Dooley (John Harvey). Later, Lorry claims to know the hero to gain admittance to the packed Club Chanteuse. The Club itself is a grand affair; a huge swing band plays on a giant stage that stretches from floor to ceiling, whilst the actual show consists of singers, dancers and even roller-skating routine featuring the Skating Vanities!<br /><br />When Tommy eventually turns up at the club, he is immediately besotted with the cute Lorry. But Molly - the real star of the Club Chanteuse - is secretly seething; she knows that Molly is a fake so she asks her sing a song from the show. Lorry gets back at Molly when she belts out the tune as if she sang it every night on stage, even with back up singers!<br /><br />Lorry and Kay continue on their journey to Washington DC and eventually bump into Tommy who coincidentally is looking for a stenographer - of course he picks Lorry. Of course Tommy can't tell who Lorry is because she's wearing glasses and has her hair in a bun, and every time he looks at her, she's looking back at him with crossed-eyes!<br /><br />The story is silly and trite and almost non-existent, and it's all merely an excuse for framing the elaborate musical numbers, which are centered on the three-tiered bandstands where Charlie Spivak and his Orchestra sit. Indeed most of the action takes place in the nightclubs where Lorry and Tommy mostly hang out.<br /><br />Obviously made for all the GI's, the film has an innocent quality combined with a sort of fierce patriotism and you really get the sense that the film is pushing the merits of the allied war effort. There's no doubt that Grable is sparkling and bubbly and she does a good job with the singing and dancing, even though the role is a bit of a caricature. But you can easily see how much she contributed to the war effort.<br /><br />It's interesting to watch films such as this - not just for the flashy musical numbers, which sometimes border in the gaudy, but also for the social relevance, and for the forties nostalgia.<br /><br />Although Pin-Up Girl may not be the best example of a War musical - the film is slight and is basically restricted to the pattern of boy-meets-girl and they live happily ever after - it's still a welcome and harmless diversion - just like Betty Grable, with her long silken legs, was a distraction for lonely soldiers of World War II.

It is simply one of the most bizarre films (in a good way) I have seen in my history of film watching. It's one of those movies that's best seen after midnight on tv during those countless hours of strange programming. Thanks to some stellar b writing by Charles & Edward Chiodo we have been given one of horror/sci-fi's best b efforts to date.<br /><br />We start off when a group of aliens, that resemble earth's version of clowns, land in the town of Crescent Cove. Once they have landed in the middle of the woods the ship takes the form of a circus tent. Our main characters Mike and Debbie are out on a date and stumble across the hidden tent. Since they think it's strange that a circus is held in the middle of nowhere they decide to check it out. While they're poking around they run into our giant headed clown friends that shoot at them with a popcorn bazooka, barely escaping.<br /><br />Once back into town they go to the police with their strange discovery but kid hating Sgt. Mooney thinks they're on drugs pulling some prank. Shortly after the clowns make their way through Crescent Cove and begin capturing the townspeople turning them into cotton candy cocoons. Once it becomes known something's wrong Mike and friends take action by going back to the tent for a final showdown with the aliens. Unfortunately they have to face  a hidden giant clown, but manage to get out alive.<br /><br />Killer Klowns from Outer Space has everything I look for in a campy b movie. It really is one of the essentials sitting high on my list of films in the category of "so bad it's good." I couldn't imagine someone watching this and not getting a kick out of it. Just by looking at it you'd have to know to expect nothing more then a over the top horror-comedy. I 100% recommend this one to the fans in the world of b. Odds are you've seen it already, but if not then check it out as soon as possible.

DeMille's best work was behind him with the coming of sound.<br /><br />This is total nonsense!<br /><br />His very last film is on my permanent Top Ten list. DeMille's remake of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) is arguably the greatest Biblical epic ever made. It's my favorite Charlton Heston movie, my favorite by Yul Brynner, Judith Anderson and especially Edw. G. Robinson (as Dathan, the conniving traitor).<br /><br />An opulent Technicolor and VistaVison achievement, it's also one of the first pictures with a stereo soundtrack. The film won a Special Effects Oscar and was nominated for Picture, Sound, Cinematography, Editing, Costume and Set Design.<br /><br />Running about 3 hours (minus music breaks), the story is fascinating throughout, piling one spectacular highlight upon anoher: the completion of Sethi's memorial city with the successful placement of an enormous obelisk, the turning of the Nile into blood and a plague Ramses causes that claims all of Egypt's first-born, the remarkable Red Sea parting that brings on the destruction of Ramses' army, an awesome sequence of Moses receiving the 10 laws on Mt. Sinal while his people, the Israelites, simultaneously engage in drunken debauchery and the worship of a Golden Calf, and so many more.<br /><br />Leonard Maltin, a critic I rarely agree with, got it right with his laudatory synopsis, describing Ten Commandments as "Vivid storytelling at its best."<br /><br />It's the Passover season, thus once again I'm watching this wondrous movie classic. There's none better!<br /><br />"So let it be written. So let it be done."<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.8) The Ten Commandments (1956) - Charton Heston/Yul Brynner/ Anne Baxter/Edw.

 | product/productId: 6301696352 | review/userId: A1L43KWWR05PCS | review/summary: THE OTHER BLONDE BOMBSHELL... | review/text: This film recounts the life of Jayne Mansfield and her transformation  from a blooming Dallas high schooler to a platinum blonde bombshell who rose to prominence in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Starring Loni Anderson as Jayne and Arnold Schwartzenegger as her one time husband and true love, Mickey Hargitay, a former Mr. Universe and bodybuilder turned business man, the film is mildly entertaining. Her story unfolds through his eyes.<br /><br />Hers is the sad story of an intelligent, beautiful  women who initially chose to be viewed as a dumb blonde sex object in order to jump start her career as a film star,  but who would later want to be given the opportunity to be considered as a serious actress. In her heyday in the 1950s, Ms. Mansfield was the toast of the town with fans up the wazoo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that was to be somewhat short-lived. Jayne Mansfield was never able to get over her stereotypic portrayal of a bimbo, so Hollywood never gave her serious consideration as an actress. In the battle of the dumb blondes, Ms. Mansfield ran a distant second to Marilyn Monroe. This relegation to the back of the pack would always stick in Ms. Mansfield's craw.<br /><br />By the time the 1960s arrived, she, instead, courted cheap publicity, drank too much, and ended up a faded, buxom has been, as well as a divorcee with three children to whom she was a devoted mother. She was now a relic from a bygone time, as tastes changed with the advent of The Beatles and a new, exciting pop culture was emerging. With Marilyn Monroe already having met her maker, Ms. Mansfield's death from a tragic car accident, at thirty six, was to herald the end of an era.<br /><br />Loni Anderson does an excellent job in the starring role, imbuing the role with enough intelligence, as well as pathos, to be compelling, though somewhat predictable . Surprisingly enough, Arnold Schwartzenegger does a credible job as Mickey Hargitay, painting a sympathetic portrait of Jayne's much beleaguered, one time husband and father to her two boys. Ray Butenika, as Ms. Mansfield's long time agent, Bob, gives a good performance. All in all, the film has an excellent cast that does its best with the somewhat mediocre script and is, at least, worth a rental.<br /><br />I actually remember seeing Jayne Mansfield, when I was a young girl. In those days, theatres in Manhattan, such as the RKO, would often times showcase films in which the star of the film would make a guest appearance. The theatre would literally role out the red carpet and oftentimes a band, as well as a host of majorettes (of which I was one), twirling batons in unison, would greet the star as she stepped out of her limousine, larger than life. The star would also to be met by a throng of cheering fans outside the theatre. Then, she would be whisked away to the theatre, where she would go on stage and say a few words, only to disappear as quickly as she had arrived.  This practice has now been consigned to the darkest recesses of the memories of those who participated in these theatrical welcome wagons.
 | product/productId: 6301661729 | review/userId: A2M66S05KKNSWC | review/summary: Ignore the Box | review/text: The box cover is a bit of a spoiler. This is unfortunate, because the first time you see this film, the ending is a real shocker. Don't ask anyone what I mean; watch it without knowing the ending, and let yourself take the wild roller coaster drop when you see it.<p>The casting is unusual and brilliant. Kim Hunter, best known for winning the supporting actress Oscar for A Streetcar Named Desire, plays Zira, a chimpanzee who is a psychologist studying human behavior. Former child star Roddy McDowell plays her husband, Cornelius. Charleton Heston is Taylor, a talking human who shakes up the ape society's view of itself as the species created in the image of god.<p>The set design and costumes hint of &quot;B&quot; IAP movies, but this is not a B-film. It is a brilliant, heavy-handed, yet not didactic commentary on human society; it is as true now as it was when it was first released upon the Vietnam-era United States.<p>Though there are sly backhands at the government that got us into Vietnam, and created the &quot;generation gap,&quot; the larger commentary on race relations and the treatment of non-human animals is staggering.<p>The ape make-up is pure art, and the film is watchable just for the human actors bringing the ape faces to life. But it's watchable for much more than thrills; watch it for its message: because of the ape allegory, the film makes many statements that couldn't be made directly.<p>On top of it all, this is plain fun, science fiction, and a fantastic action film.<p>Rated G when you could say &quot;damn&quot; in a G film, this film is something that children will love-- though there's so much in it, and adult won't pick it all up without repeated viewings.<p>This is a buyable film; you'll want to watch it again and again.
 | product/productId: 6300190110 | review/userId: A3OB3WDUN51D8A | review/summary: Enjoyable and funny | review/text: The first time I saw Depardieu and Richard team up was in the 1981 film La Chevre, which became a Worldwide hit as one of the funniest films. It had a few weaknesses, like the gorilla in Mexico, which suggested that the makers were not totally serious in striving to make a perfect film and did not expect it to become such a huge hit. Yet, La Chevre was a comedy magic.<br />Thus, I was excited to see the next Depardieu - Richard collaboration, the 1983 Les Comperes. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed. Les Comperes is not as funny, nor as engaging as La Chevre. I had the feeling that Depardieu and Richard did not quite have their hearts in it. It almost felt like a sequel. Depardieu again played the bully and Richard again was the nerd. Although the main story is great, many of the comic scenes were reworked versions from La Chevre. Further, the supporting cast was not as good as in La Chevre. In particular, the actor playing Tristan, the son that run away, did not fit and was not believable.<br />If you have not seen La Chevre, you will find Les Comperes enjoyable and better than most comedies.

I've seen this movie so many times I actually have most of the words memorized. This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT. And for all the Beetlejuice lovers and fans out there this is a must have to your video or DVD collection~
 | product/productId: 5559375241 | review/userId: A1L3RWD0VD0A1P | review/summary: Simply grand. | review/text: The Village is so big, I find it difficult to begin writing about it. Like M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, there's a whole lot going on ... and even if you figure out "the twist" (as you will likely do within about fifteen minutes), so much is happening that it doesn't matter. You're not there for the twist per se--you're there for the ride.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, and unlike the idiots behind me in the theater who whined about the ending, so far as I was concerned the abruptness and the "lack of closure" weren't a problem. The story ends when it does because everything that's really important has been addressed. Whether or not the wounded boy lives or dies is--well, not necessarily irrelevant, but insignificant to the grand scheme of the tale. Does anyone really care that Little Red Riding Hood's grandma lives or dies (depending on the version of the fable)? Not so much. The story is not about the wounded/ailing character's recovery--the story is about her journey.<br /><br />In short, this is really an exceptional film if you're paying attention.

 | product/productId: 6301208773 | review/userId: AN5GCUGR8LJU0 | review/summary: a great start to the series | review/text: I think what makes Die Hard rise above other action films of the 80s is that the hero is just a regular guy. At the time, Willis was known mainly for comedy films, so having him be an action hero let the audience actually wonder if he would make it out, unlike Stallone and Arnold's indestructible, muscle bound supermen. When McClane gets hurt, he has the injury for the rest of the film. Another thing that makes this film great is the claustrophobia. Even though it's a big building, you can't help but notice the chances of McClane and a terrorist happening upon each other are significantly increased. Also, unlike its sequels, which are also very good in their own right, there is no gaping hole in the bad guys' plan. The plot, as far as I can tell, is airtight. You'll be guarenteed a good time with Die Hard.

 | product/productId: 0780627024 | review/userId: A26R9RQATQ0PQL | review/summary: GEE WHIZ! | review/text: Pleasantville is a 1950's tv show that paints the lives of people living in a "perfect" world, full of good family values where colors don't exist, where firemen never have to deal with fire but just rescuing cats, where couples sleep in separate beds, where the most physical contact couples have is holding hands or a kiss on the cheek, where people don't swear, where the basketball team never ever loses, where people are just happy living routine lives where everyone loves each other and ...nothing ever happens. <p>When 2 teenagers from the 90s find themselves trapped into pleasantville by some kind of "luck", the whole world that pleasantville is based on collapses. The two teenagers now in the skin of the two kids of the show, start changing the way people think. Or rather just let people think for themselves. The crowd of pleasantville discovers than there is more than holding hands in relationships, that you can't always win a basketball game and that if you prepare the salad before you make the burger, life will keep going.<p>This movie is to me a satire on how people have become free and how the impredictibility of life is what living really is. In some ways, the movie makes allusions to the book burnings and the rewriting of history by the nazis, the segregation of blacks from whites, and how people fought to overcome it all to become free. Free to think for yourself, free to be who you want to be regardless of what the society expects of you.<p>The Genius of pleasantville is how all those underlying very serious subjects are all wrapped into sugar, and turned into a very enjoyable, innocent-like, cute little story.<p>This is a great movie, very smartly done and very original.

I only have this to add: Hugh Grant did surprise me, it never occurred to me that he could be such a good actor. Emma Thompson is pleasant, mature and adorable as always. But having seen too many of her movies, it is not easy to focus on her part here alone. Allan and especially Kate was such a hugh success.<p>Possibly one of the best Sense and sensibility we have, not only for this generation and for many generations to come.

 | product/productId: 6302363128 | review/userId: AC32305TO79HL | review/summary: Great, Just Great! | review/text: La Bamba has always been one of my favourite films. Maybe it's just the fact that it is so real, based on a true story, on a real person's life... and a real person's tragedy.<p>The film is a journey through all possible emotions - right from the hope, then the dream that has come true, and to the end of it all. Which is, when one considers it, maybe not purely tragic. 'Cause like the ancient Greeks believed: There is no greater happiness than to die when you are most happy.<p>It is left unsaid how much of La Bamba that is actually not based on real happenings. But the makers of the film have, unlike so many others who base films on 'true' stories, succeeded in eliminating the less-credible details, and they have made everything seem very real and very relevant.<p>A heartfelt, warm, and cathing film. If you have never seen it, well do so! You are missing a great experience!
 | product/productId: 6301461924 | review/userId: A11XKY4EIU2KNR | review/summary: Great for Bogart fans | review/text: Now this is a great flick. No one played the hard-edged bad guy like Bogie. This flick is old schol, meaning the story depends on the acting and not special effects or overused violence. <p>Bogart, his brother, and a simple minded convict escape prison and hold up in a suberbian 'Beaver-Cleaver' household. They have to hideout there until Bogie gets some dough from his girlfriend. The confrontations between the family and the convicts keep this movie going fluently without a break in drama, suspense, or action. If you've only seen Casablanca or the Maltese Falcon, rent or buy this flick if you like or are interested in Humphrey Bogart.

 | product/productId: 5552188349 | review/userId: A3UDYY6L2NH3JS | review/summary: Justice always comes from the underground | review/text: Thieves robbing thugs robbing crooks robbing etc. A first robbery and then a member of this first  team robs his team and then the victims of this fink recuperate their gold from him in a spectacular third robbery. From Venice to Los Angeles, from gondolas to cars, from canals to overstuffed streets, etc. The interest is not so much in the action which is simple and well dynamized by a good rhythm. Not so much in the plot and the suspense because we all know from the very start that justice will prevail, I mean that the first robbers will recuperate their gold no matter what. The interest of the film is in the details of the action. It all revolves around the use of hightechnology in city managing (here the traffic and the subway) and in security systems (here safes and the tools to break them without explosives). But once again this does not create any suspense because we know this hightechnology will not fail, except on order and command. The second interest is in the characters. They are simple and their psychologies are also very simple, but less simple than we could have feared. Hence they have some simple depth nearly like real human beings. A father who is absent, a father figure who is looming high and a man who comes into the slot and becomes the absent father who is no father any more but just a plain and desired male lover. This needs two rather good actors to imply and impersonate this situation in simple face expression and body language. The camera does the rest. In other words a good entertaining experience. By the way the fink looks like a fink from the very start : the way he walks, the way he smiles without smiling, etc. But why on earth was he given a slightly mexican or at least latin american look ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

It is certainly one of the best westerns ever filmed as well. As others have already written, it is dark, rich in both visuals and in characters. Eastwood's character is really a anti-hero lost in who he is and seems to be looking for a bit of redemption.<br /><br />Totally worth every penny. I was fortunate enough to have been working at a theater when this movie was released and for the many nights, weeks, and months that it was shown, I watched every minute of it I could. As nice as it is to watch a movie in the luxury of one's own home, nothing can compare to a movie like this on the big screen. I sorely miss those days.
 | product/productId: 0783223161 | review/userId: A3NKFB39AIEN8W | review/summary: Twisted!! | review/text: Not Hitchcock's best, but probably his most commercial and well-known of all his black and white thrillers. And I do mean thriller. Even after all the copycats since, the film has lost none of its powers to evoke the most primal fears in all of us.<br /><br />Psycho is about false appearances and how we are deceived by them. How a beautiful normal looking woman can all of a sudden just snap and do something evil out of the blue. This, along with split-personality disorders, is what Psycho is all about. About the vast gulf separating those who may do something on a whim, such as cheating on their taxes, ripping a DVD, etc., and those who are genuinely psychotic.<br /><br />This is one of Hitchcock's best looking black and white films, more shades of gray as though to amplify the ambiguous nature of good and evil, that good and evil resides in all of us in various proportions.<br /><br />But philosophy and metaphor aside, Psycho is a great film for the ages created in a time where there were no gimmicks like 3D or cgi to hide behind. A classic in every sense of the word and worth the 12 bucks or so you can buy it here for. Lastly, for those who haven't seen this movie and are sitting on the fence because this is an "old" movie in black and white, remember that color had been around for decades before this movie was made and that black and white was a style choice, as it is when it's used today. There's no such thing as an old movie anyway because if you haven't seen it it's new. Plus, who'd want them to mess up a great film like this with color or, heaven forbid, 3D or cgi? Great fun movie.

Surrounding them are various other members of the town who were also excellent casting decisions; Mike, the gas station guy (Mako, recently in the TV series Black Mask and as the bad guy in a host of gung-ho movies like Pearl Harbor and Bulletproof Monk) and the Pitkins (Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay, both just starting out) were examples of the incredible job Marjorie Simkin did casting this movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't change the fact that, well, the world doesn't blow up. It's hard to have a nuclear holocaust movie without a nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />What you're left with is a proto-Lifetime Original Movie, a psychodrama about a family who's lost their father in a terrible accident; this particular accident just happens to have wiped out San Francisco (in other words, set it in a different time period and this could easily be an earthquake flick). Looked at from that perspective, it's miles better than your typical LOM, but in comparison to the other films in its genre-- especially Threads and The Day After, the yardsticks by which nuclear-war films have been measured for twenty years-- Testament doesn't really make the cut.<br /><br />The Lifetime Movie Channel, however, should they ever discover it, will get years of retread mileage out of this flick. Coming soon to a cable company near you. Then maybe they'll stop showing Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? once a week. **

It's actually a very well thought out film that does reflect some of the social upheaval in the United States during the late 60's and early 70's. Planet of the Apes films have always been a comment on the social climate during the period they were made.<br /><br />Conquest is the darkest film of the Apes series, and the two different versions on the Blu-ray disc have varying levels of violence. The uncut version is very in your face and bloody and ends on a very violent note, which if you discount the fifth movie in the series Battle for the Planet of the Apes, makes a perfect transition to the first Apes film which is set after Conquest chronologically. In the first Apes film men are hunted for sport by apes, used for medical experiments and treated like animals. It was a pretty violent film for it's day as well.<br /><br />The PG rated version of Conquest ends on a much more upbeat note that the timeline may have changed and that things might not end up so badly. There is still violence but not as much blood as the uncut version. It's really great to be able to see both versions of the film so that you can see where the film makers originally intended it to go and what the test audiences did not like about the movie before it was re-edited.<br /><br />The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson who also directed The Guns of Navarone. And the look of the film is very deliberate. I suppose one could complain as the previous reviewer did that the artistic use of colors in the film is distracting, but I feel it shows that the creators of this film actually put some thought into how they wanted the audience to react to the characters and environments on the screen. One also has to remember that this movie was made several years before Star Wars came on the scene and changed the way we look at special effects in science fiction films. But for the period it was made in the costumes and effects are very well done. Personally I love the look of the city in the film but then I'm a bit of a apes fan to begin with.<br /><br />Anyway in my opinion this is my favorite of the Apes sequels. If your an apes fan or you've seen the first three but never checked out the fourth, the Blu-ray version is the one to get. You get to see both versions of the film in very good video quality with great sound as well.

First of all, main character of this film, John, he commits murder because he cannot get out of his wife&iexcl;s spirit. In this film, when John commits murder, he always wears a wedding dress. It is similar to &iexcl;Psycho&iexcl;, when murderer commits murder, he wear a mother&iexcl;s cloth. Anyway, two of murderer is not normal they have an abnormal mentality. Most of thriller movies like these, usually as if these characters appear. Whatever the reason, the mood of this film is excellent. It is supposed to be a film with good background music and mood. Mario Bava, one of a great horror director, his films has a unique style. This film also is a one of his stylish films.

John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are awesome here! Belushi and Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood Blues who want to raise the money by putting their band back together and staging a large gig. The DVD is great. The picture and sound quality are wonderful. The extras are superb including the documentary and the production photographs. If you own a DVD player, you must own &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. I think you won't be disappointed.

It doesn't have the gore that the newer version has but it keeps you in suspense as only a Vincent Price movie could.<br /><br />I specially recommend the Warner Brothers version which is shown both in Full and Widescreen formats. The picture quality is great. There is a colorized version available also but, in my opinion, black and white is the best way to watch these classics.<br /><br />I recommend this film.

A message came on the screen saying "Video is not available in your region". Having never seen a message like that before, I attempted to play it in my blu-ray player. This time I got a "region error" message. We then tried one more dvd player only to receive the same message. At this point, my only conclusion is that the problem is with the dvd itself. Like I said, very disappointing.

 | product/productId: 0790734559 | review/userId: A3GNJ49HROWM5N | review/summary: An exhilarating action extravaganza | review/text: Mad Max is the series that will forever be known for launching Mel Gibson's fantastic career.  Two of the films in the series, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, are among is his five best as they create  action sequences that are simply exciting and complex societies and scenery  that are true visions to behold.<p>The Road Warrior is considered the best  of the series (Beyond Thunderdome is just as good in my opinion) and the  best post-apocalyptic film in history.  Of course, when you think of the  latter comment, such films as Waterworld and The Postman come to mind.  Those were true turkeys that had no idea how to execute good ideas and  premises.  The Road Warrior doesn't make that mistake and what results is  the ultimate low budget action film, greater than even James Cameron's The  Terminator and outpacing almost every chase film in history.<p>The plot of  the film is in the near future in the outback of Australia, where society  has crumbled due to an apocalyptic war and the survivors must struggle  against one another.  One such man is Max (Mel Gibson), a loner after his  wife and child were killed by a gang.  Now, he wanders around the deserts  in his car with his dog, searching for gasoline, a commodity that has  become all too precious in this time period.<p>He encounters a small fort  of people who seem to have a very large suppy of fuel.  All they want to do  is leave the desert and start civilization over in a more comfortable  setting. Of course, the large fuel supply obviously causes trouble for  them.  A gang called the Humungus, led by Lord Humungus (a vicious man in a  hockey mask),  want the fuel and will do whatever is necessary to  accomplish that task.<p>Max notices the danger and strikes a deal with the  people of the fort.  Let him haul in a vehicle that can hold the gasoline  and in return he gets his vehicle back with a good supply of fuel.  This  leads to some of the most exciting chases in film history, along with a  finale that must be seen to be believed.<p>There are so many things that  work during the action sequences.  George Miller directs each chase with  relentless speed and carnage, Brian May's pulse-pounding score adds to the  excitement, and Mel Gibson's terrific performance gives us a hero to truly  root for.<p>This is a film where everything best is saved for last.  The  best chase in the film-and one of the best in film history-involves the  entire Humungus gang chasing Max as he drives the truck with the tanker of  gas down a one lane highway.  It's a fifteen minute chase that holds  nothing back and the result is spectacular.  There are even a couple of  surprises at the end that bear a certain irony.<p>One thing I can say that  is consistent within the Mad Max films is a perfect final scene.  Mad Max's  final scene left a feeling of emptiness and despair.  The Road Warrior's  final reels give a feeling that humanity still has a sense of dignity left.

The time spent on character development makes it all worth while.  James Woods is in his finest form of any movie I have ever seen him in, including Salvador, and that is saying something. DeNiro is even better, and his part proves why he is considered one of the best actors of the past 30+ years. Then there are all of the supporting actors, who were amazing as well.  The fact that this movie didn't win a Best Picture Oscar is one of the great travesties of cinematic justice. That is all.

Every time I have watched it, I have come away with a more positive attitude, a penchant to attend funerals of total strangers, and a consuming desire to roll down a hill of daisies ! The dialog is one not to be glossed over, or ignored. From maude's &quot;smelling machine&quot; ( &quot;I smell snow&quot; ), her wooden sculpture of the female form, to her throwing Harold's souviner gift into the ocean just off West Cliff in Santa Cruz ( &quot;That way I'll always know where it is &quot;! ), all demonstrate a rare perspective on life, one that exudes love, gentleness, faith, confidence, and internal beauty. Ending is tough to handle, but demonstrates Maude's inevitable effect on Harold. Absolutely beautiful !

 | product/productId: 6301798600 | review/userId: A3FN0U5JRHRM0D | review/summary: One of the best westerns about the American Indians of all time! | review/text: This film gives the best multilateral view of the American Indians versus the American white settlers than any Western genre of film I have seen.  The story behind this film is a type of parable that can really be applied to any inter-racial or -ethnic conflict of any kind.  It really states how we, regardless of race, religion, color, or ethnic background, can unite and work together to accomplish peace through increased efforts to bring about mutual understanding and trust.  It is moving story of what "real" diplomacy is all about and the surrendering of one's own personal ambitions, prejudices, or fears to bring about the greater good of the whole.  Too often we judge an entire group of people by a few bad men found among them and allow that to be the catalyst in forming our opinions or sentiments regarding another race or group of people.  This story shows how there are good and bad among all people and that conditions of peace and friendship should not be based on the few "bad apples" that so often spoil those relationships with other peoples, races and nations by our holding up those few as being respresentative of an entire people or nation.  It is a story that would serve all of us well today in a world filled with so much of hate, violence, prejudice, and mistrust.  It also does much to tell the story of how one person, or small group of people, through their own personal efforts and sacrifice can do a great deal to help make the world a better place for everyone concerned.  It really stirs consideration of how we can all unite together regardless of our backgrounds to overcome the real enemy in our midst.
 | product/productId: 0792159659 | review/userId: A1X1CEGHTHMBL1 | review/summary: The cover-up that destroyed a family! | review/text: An undercover military chief warrant officer, Paul Brenner (John Travolta), is acting like a sergeant who wants to buy and resell stolen military weapons as a sting operation. By accident he meets a beautiful army Captain, Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) while he is trying to change a flat tire on his car. She helps him and he takes a liking for her. Within days she is murdered and Paul is called in as the investigating officer on the case and finds himself tied up in politics and protocol as the Captain was the general's daughter....<br /><br />This was a pretty good movie but it does contain a lot of nudity and violence. The story line was pretty good and the acting was excellent but the movie had its high points and low points. The rape scenes and graphic violence were bad but the plot regarding the father's actions were disgusting and you begin to understand the actions of the young captain in the movie. This movie was a solid 4 stars but be prepared for some scenes you may not like.<br /><br />It was an entertaining movie about several tough topics. You should watch it.

But Dan is getting involved with Herbert West's experiments which involves bringing the dead back to life with a special glowing green serum called "Re-Agent" but unfortunately it creates violent zombies that go awry.<br /><br />A sick, gory, and hilarious horror Sci-fi comedy based on a HP Lovecraft story has become a cult classic since it's release in 1985! This movie was released in that year unrated in theaters with a "No one under 18 warning" but became a minor hit in theaters including critical acclaim in this cross between "E.R" and "Evil Dead". Suprisingly good acting for a low budget movie even by David Gale who wickedly plays the evil Dr. Carl Hill whom becomes the best zombie of the movie. There's alot of nasty gore in this movie like a skull and brain surgery scene with sleaze as well, it's not for the faint of heart or squeamish but a must see and must have for fans of horror, horror comedy, gore and zombie flicks.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Millenium DVD has awesome picture & Sound from THX! great extras include storyboard-scene comparison, audio commentaries, interviews, trailers & TV Spots, Extended scenes from the "R" rated cut, Bios and Deleted scenes, most recommended.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Evil Dead 1 & 2", "Day of the Dead", "Frankenstein ( 1931)", "Cannibal Holocaust", "City of the living Dead ( a.k.a.

 | product/productId: 0767726227 | review/userId: ABH4G7TVI6G2T | review/summary: classic Mel Brooks | review/text: HIGH ANXIETY was Mel Brooks' salute to Alfred Hitchcock.  Though many of the gags do fall flat, the entire movie as a whole is a complete joy.<br /><br />Mel Brooks plays Richard Thorndyke, the new head psychiatrist of the leading `Institute For the Very, Very Nervous'.  Thorndyke himself is plagued by bouts of `high anxiety' (vertigo).  When Thorndyke is framed for murder and discovers the sinister cover-ups at the Institute, he joins the leggy Victoria Brisbane (Madeline Kahn) in a race against time to rescue her father from the clutches of sadistic Head Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman)!<br /><br />Brooks and the rest of the cast have an absolute ball.  Cloris Leachman sports a traffic-cone decolletage that would make Madonna jealous, in her inspired performance as Nurse Diesel (and her scenes with Harvey Korman are hysterical; you won't be able to view their performances in HERBIE GOES BANANAS the same way again).  Madeline Kahn is Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint and Tippi Hedren combined in her performance as Victoria Brisbane (now that's quite a lot of Hitchcock cool blonde-ness!).<br /><br />Classic Mel Brooks.

Another great movie. | review/text: I recently watched Spirited Away and I loved it so much I have bought several other movies of Miyazaki.<br /><br />I have to admit that of the ones I've seen, Howls' Moving Castle is my favorite but all of them are worth watching.<br /><br />Castle in the Sky is about a young girl who needs to discover her ancestor's history in order to unlock a power that has fallen into the wrong hands. This is actually a really over simplified version of the plot, but that is the gist of it. As always, the movie is visually amazing. All of the Miyazki films make me feel like I am watching art in motion.
 | product/productId: 0783240325 | review/userId: A1NNS31GRVDJNB | review/summary: Old-fashioned drama with sociopolitical subtext | review/text: Scott Hicks' stunningly beautiful film version of David Guterson's best-seller comes off as an unabashedly old-fashioned courtroom drama with a sociopolitical subtext. The accused, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), is charged with the brutal murder of a fellow fisherman in the Pacific Northwest island town of San Piedro. Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), the defendant's wife, fears her husband can't get a fair trial in a community that, in 1954, remains divided by the anti-Japanese sentiments that flowered during World War II. Meanwhile, local reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) observes the courtroom proceedings with an acutely personal interest: Long ago, he loved Hatsue. The aptly claustrophobic trial scenes are arrestingly intense, especially when Max Von Sydow is on camera as an elderly yet quick-witted defense attorney. But "Snow Falling on Cedars" wisely spends most of its time outside of the courtroom, as `40s flashbacks reveal the connections and conflicts in a close-knit community where a far-off war brings out the worst in friends and neighbors.

 | product/productId: 6302120284 | review/userId: A1CYOHNGQ1WED1 | review/summary: Fun but terrible | review/text: Shot on a budget of about $4.78, Killers from Space is one of those fun old 50's sci fi movies that provides plenty of unintentional laughs.<br /><br />Peter Graves plays a scientist riding in a plane to observe a nuclear explosion. The plane crashes and he is believed to be dead. He shows up a few days later, disoriented and with a scar over his heart. He's seeing things and not thinking clearly and eventually starts talking about aliens living in caves. It turns out he was saved by aliens in black jumpsuits with Marty Feldman eyes. He was saved so he could tell them when the next nuclear test was because they are gathering and storing the energy to feed to their menagerie of giant insects and lizards. When they have a large enough zoo, they will turn them loose on the public and wipe out the Earth's population.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is fun to watch, but make no mistake that as a film it's terrible. The alien's "look" is ridiculous and watching Peter Graves cringe from giant insects that aren't really there is hilarious. The plot isn't bad as 50s sci fi goes, it's just so poorly done.

Only twice in the film are depictions made of Jesus, only once of the Nativity and these depictions are quite tasteful from my Christian point of view.<br />  Despite the fact that the film is going on 30 years old it's comedy and political satire still makes me laugh like a moose on cheap Norsky vodka.  "The Latin Lesson" scene always puts me on the floor.<br />  It's not a sacrilegious film.  It's a comedy about what people usually make of themselves when they take themselves to seriously.<br />  Wink Wink, nudge nudge, say no more.
 | product/productId: 0800183428 | review/userId: AIFXFHO2N9WJB | review/summary: The Boys Are Back... | review/text: Eight years after achieving box office success with audiences far and wide, director Michael Bay and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer joined together with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence to deliver another non-stop action packed movie featuring Miami's most disfunctional Detective duo, Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence respectively) in "Bad Boys 2".<br /><br />When a new designer drug begins to plague Miami, detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are assigned the task of bringing the drug peddlers to justice.  However, when the investigation isn't being wrapped as quickly as the government would like, enter a young, attractive government agent (Gabrielle Union) who just so happens to be Marcus' sister.  With his sister going undercover to break apart this drug cartel, Marcus becomes extremely overprotective of everything his sister does and is suspicious of anyone around her, to make matters worse for Marcus, his sister just so happens to be dating his partner Mike.  One thing's for sure with this much going on it's definitely going to be one exciting ride.<br /><br />Clearly 8 years has done nothing to dampen the comedic timing between the two leads, as Will and Martin easily fall back into the characters that made them huge stars.  The story is much better this time around, more depth is given to all of the characters, and the addition of Gabrielle Union brings a new level of disfunction and comedy-fodder to the proceedings.  The action is even more over-the-top and amazing to watch without becoming stale, the stunts require more from the stars who did a majority of their own stunts and even after an 8 year hiatus, their athletic prowess appears to have not waned one iota.  Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have once again succeeding in achieving huge amounts of box office gold as they have many times before with films, such as; "Bad Boys", "Armageddon", and "The Rock", and now the first sequel they've ever worked on together can join the list of their hugely successful films.<br /><br />If you haven't seen "Bad Boys 2" please do yourself a favor and watch this movie along with it's predecessor, and sit down to enjoy a night of laugh out loud comedy, extreme action, and excellent storytelling.  I promise you won't regret it.<br /><br />"Bad Boys 2" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality.
 | product/productId: 6302181569 | review/userId: A1W6NBAYJ7Y08F | review/summary: Prince Prospero in the space | review/text: " Forbidden planet " is a very interesting science-fiction adaptation of Shakespeare's play " The tempest ". As prince Prospero, Dr. Morbius ( Walter Pidgeon ) lives in solitary confinement, with the only company of his beloved daughter ( Anne Francis ) and his servile automaton Robby, in the ideal world he has created and jealously protected of any human intrusion and interference that could come from outside. A spaceship from the Earth arrives to his planet-island and try to investigate the origin of the invisible and destructive force that provoked the vanishing of the others members of the expedition that travelled with Dr. Morbius. As Shakespeare's play the film illustrates the perils of intellectual pride and isolation and that awful truth of " the dreams of rationalist minds provoke monsters" . A concise direction; suggestive script; charming and imaginative visual-effects and bizarre settings do of it one of the best scienci-fiction movies of the fifties. Very recommendable.<br /><br />This doublesided DVD edition offers so the widescreen version of the movie as the full-screen one.

And what's in Allan's mind isn't very nice. Still, Ella is determined to fulfill her beloved master's every wish: Allan think, monkey do.<br /><br />As someone who is not enamored of Romero's zombie flicks, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Yes, it's hokey here and there, but it never fails to entertain.<br /><br />Based upon the novel Monkey-shines, by Michael Stewart.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson

(25th Anniversary Blu-Ray Release) | review/text: The image is razor sharp -- really, a marvel to behold -- the widescreen image is stable and color is spot on. The sound is first rate -- just don't expect a wraparound experience from a 25 year old film. It has limited but quite interesting extra features and a nice commemorative booklet inside that single disc blu case. So use your old DVD as a frisbee and put a stake through that VHS -- this is *the* version to see! Seriously, the film has *never* looked so good.<br /><br />The movie itself is a subtle play on "The Magnificent Seven" -- fans will notice Elmer Bernstein is on board in the music department.<br /><br />For sheer entertainment, it's safe to say, there's nothing like "Three Amigos"! (Or, as some might say, thank goodness!)<br /><br />It's bright, brilliant, exuberant -- on its own terms. What can I say? (Sew like *the* wind!) If you like good, clean, quirky humor -- lighten up and give it a spin!<br /><br />The Three Amigos ride again!

This DVD is not 16:9 encoded! | review/text: This film is a long-time favorite of mine, but I give this DVD edition (Warner 65053) a 2 star rating because of the deceptive packaging and the DVD digital encoding used. The wording on the DVD package is as follows: <p>"...WIDESCREEN VERSION...preserving the 'scope' aspect ratio of its orignal theatrical exhibition. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN."<p>There is a lot of confusion in the marketplace due to a lack of agreement among the studios regarding the labels for the various DVD aspect ratios and their encoding, but on all other DVDs that I've seen, which bear the description "enhanced for widescreen", the higher resolution 16:9 digital encoding was used.  Despite the presence of this label however, this DVD is plain old-fashioned letterbox.  Even for those of us with true wide screen capability, this DVD looks like low rez letterboxed VHS.  <p>As a result of this experience, I will be far more circumspect of all Warner editions from now on, and if I have any doubt of their being 16:9, I'll skip them. So much of this material is already on my shelf in VHS format. If I am to upgrade these titles, I insist they be true 16:9 encoded for widescreen TV.  <p>I also dislike the cheap cardboard "snap case" used on nearly all Warner titles. When it comes down to choosing between which movies to buy, the bonus of an Amaray style keep case is often the deciding factor.  By saving a penny or two on these cheap cases, Warner is hurting their bottom line, over-all.  Most people I know prefer the keep case.  In the competition for the consumer's dollar, why does Warner put themselves at such a disadvantage by using such cheap and nonstandard packaging?<p>Come on Warner,get with the rest of the industry with your packaging, and please quit making us guess which video encoding is used. Those of us who have widescreen gear are savvy enough to understand what 16:9 means, whereas "enhanced for widescreen" is now anybody's guess.

 | product/productId: 6300214370 | review/userId: A1A4DEENGHK51T | review/summary: Everybody cut footloose! | review/text: Ah......... those small, Midwestern towns. One bad accident, and the entire town looks for someone, or something, to blame. In this case, they blamed dancing and rock &amp; roll music. As a result, they outlawed both. For those of us who can't dance a lick or keep a tune to save our lives, this might be a pretty good place to live in. But for Ren (Kevin Bacon), he's just arrived in a town that will always seem like Friday the 13th to him.<p>Ren and his mom have just moved to this small town from the big city of Chicago. Naturally, Ren is a fish out of water here. Everytime there's trouble, people start pointing at him, whether it was his fault or not.<p>But don't feel too bad for Ren. He has made some friends in his High School, but he's also ticked off a few too. And his plan to have a Senior Prom (an event that has not happened in this town for 6 years) is threatening to divide the town in half.<p>Many people will not like this movie for the sole reason of the 80s music and dance. But there is a story behind the music, one that was brilliantly told. I have seen this movie many, many times, and each time I watch it I catch something that I had missed before. This was not a teen movie made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the teen movie craze at the time. It has a message worth listening to.<p>Unfortunatley, the DVD is lacking in extras. Of course, this movie was made back when DVDs were nothing more than an idea in somebody's head. Still, considering the popularity both then and now that this movie has enjoyed, it would have been nice to get the cast back together and produced something new to offer us.
 | product/productId: 0792842731 | review/userId: A2QQHIY23PL7H3 | review/summary: Bond takes on the media | review/text: Tomorrow Never Dies was the 18th official James Bond film, and the second one starring Pierce Brosnan. This time, Bond must race to stop a media mongul from igniting World War III between the Chinese and British for the sake of media ratings.<br /><br />For me at least, TND has gotten better with repeat viewings. The main criticism of this film has always been that it turns Bond into a 'run-and-gun' generic action hero and that it favours pyrotechnics and stunts over a developed plot. It's a problem all the newer Bond movies have had, but TND is where it's most obvious. Once you accept that though, there's a lot of fun to be had here. Lots of great sequences, including a parking garage chase and one on a motorcycle. Michelle Yeoh, being an action star herself, is the best of the "secret agent" Bond girls. Yeoh and her stunt team manage a fight sequence ripped from Hong Kong action movies that almost feels out of place in a western Bond film. And David Arnold's first Bond score is a sexy, classy, memorable affair that's worth buying the soundtrack for.<br /><br />The DVD packs a lot in. Two audio commentaries, an isolated score track, and a multi-angle storyboard featurette. It's missing a strong making-of documentary, but packs in a generalized featurette that aired on TV and is worth watching. Tomorrow Never Dies isn't the strongest Bond film, but it's pretty action-filled romp that's worth owning for Bond fans.

 | product/productId: 630236325X | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: This wonderful picture will make you wanna sing... | review/text: Who doesn't know the words to the song `Singin' in the Rain'?  I mean, seriously, even if you have yet to see the movie I'm sure you could sing that song word for word right now.<br /><br />Go ahead; I'll wait.<br /><br />The thing is that I too had never seen this movie yet knew all those words and it made me question just why it was that I never sat down to watch this beloved musical.  I am not really a huge musical lover, but then again, I've never been one to disregard a movie because of genre before.  I'll watch anything at least once.  So, when this came on TCM a few months ago I just had to watch it.  I got everything ready for `movie night' (the drinks, the friends, the snacks) and I settled in to watch what has steadily been considered one of the top ten movies of all time.<br /><br />I loved it!<br /><br />Everything about this movie fits so perfectly into one another.  The music is divine, the performances are stellar, the set pieces are delicious and the script is fun, fresh and wholly entertaining.  There is not a single misstep here.  It's not the best movie of all time, but it works magic with every fiber of its being.<br /><br />The film tells of film star Don Lockwood as he struggles to transition himself from `silent' film star to `talkie' film star.  His frequent costar and rumored lover Lina Lamont is a selfish and spoiled diva whose voice is just not suited for film, so a young and talented singer named Kathy Selden is hired to dub her voice for their upcoming film.  When Don falls in love with Kathy things get out of hand.  Lina is furious and it becomes apparent that their love affair could sink the whole picture.<br /><br />Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor make a wonderful team here, feeding off each others energy to create some of the most impressive and widely acclaimed dance numbers in musical history.  Solo they are spectacular, but together they are even better; and what is so awesome is that when Debbie Reynolds (who is so refreshingly spunky here) jumps in she makes the perfect pair into a vibrant threesome.  The real scene stealer though is Jean Hagen.  She may not sing or dance but she acts her tail off, delivering an iconic comedic performance that will have you rolling in your seats.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time (I tend to prefer the dramatic and depressing films, so this was a nice change of pace).  I've since seen the film again and loved it just as much if not more the second time around.  This is a film designed to make you smile, and is succeeds at doing just that.

The acting is fair, and the story is fairly interesting, but the mindset of Darin's "Italian" hustler is a lot of fun, plus, he sings in the movie, too!  It's a romantic ballad, nothing of the splish-splash category, but any song by Darin is a real romp.  Worth watching for that part, alone.  Otherwise, the story of the frustrated housewife in a bad marriage gets a little long.  Forsythe is good in his part, as are Shirley Jones and Lloyd Bridges.  A good movie on a rainy day.

 | product/productId: 6301050886 | review/userId: AJH56SEX96IH4 | review/summary: A great caper movie -- but watch the language | review/text: You know the plot already if you're looking at these reviews so I want to mention two things.  First, Though ostensibly a thriller/spy movie, at heart it's a caper movie where a master "outlaw" (Matheau", playing a rogue agent) outwits the police (the CIA, in this case).  For it's wit, it's outstanding cast and it's wry humor I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Second, the language can be a problem with plenty of four letter words uttered, as one of the reviewers makes note of.  So what would otherwise be a very suitable family movie may not be in your case.  The version I saw (not this DVD) had the bad language dubbed out which was actually somewhat jarring.
 | product/productId: 6301058283 | review/userId: AIMR915K4YCN | review/summary: That Old Time Religion... | review/text: I watched this one expecting a goofy movie about inbreds or hellish hillbillies on the loose. I figured it would stink, but was hoping for laughs. Well, AMERICAN GOTHIC surprised me! The group of young people, while fairly dumb, were not as annoying as most such human prey. Yvonne De Carlo (yep, Lilly Munster) and Rod Steiger (Ammityville Horror) were great as Ma and Pa, the strange pair of hyper-religious 1920s throw-backs who terrorize the young'uns. We are also introduced to the pair's twisted brood of homicidal offspring! There's a nice ending too, w/ a scorched-earth approach! Watch Sarah Torgov emerge as the evil family's worst nightmare! She's a blast! Highly recommended...

I have seen both versions and found this one fills in all the blanks.<br /><br />With Enhanced WIDESCREEN, 5.1 Surround Sound and a hi-def TV who needs to go to the theater?<br /><br />If you like this movie, you might check out "Open Range", another great Costner film.<br /><br />L8R Daze

 | product/productId: 0783113315 | review/userId: A5TZXWU8AALIC | review/summary: Beautiful, Deep, Devastating and True | review/text: How Anthony Hopkins missed an Oscar for this film is a bewildering outrage: he wasn't even nominated! (Is it Hollywood's skittishness about Hopkins playing one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th Century?).<p>This was an emotionally-shattering film to watch, a love story that reaches so much deeper than anything I'd seen before. I NEVER cry at films (came close with SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE ENGLISH PATIENT) but SHADOWLANDS pushed me over the edge. I remember watching the audience leave the theatre: they shuffled out with shell-shocked expressions, everyone looking deep into themselves. The parents of two sisters I took called me the next day to ask what we had seen (the girls went home and had been strangely quiet).<p>I'd read C.S. Lewis' theological books for years but had no idea of what his personal life was like, so SHADOWLANDS was a wonderful insight into his life.<br />(My only problem--and from what I've read of people who knew him--is one single line at the end of the film: "I have no answers--only the life that I've lived." "Jack" Lewis would've never said that: his faith became even stronger after his tragic marriage. If that line were taken out, it would be a flawless movie).<p>I unabashedly loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants an intelligent, genuine love story.

I thought then and still do that it is some of the best music he had written.  The released version of &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; was heavily edited, due to the content of the ending.  There were many musicians in the studio that were visibly upset with the violence, and Roy actually apologized for it enough though he had no part of the actual filming of the film.  I saw the the uncut version, and it was very violent at that time. Now days it would be acceptible.  Apart from the overacting of Candice Bergen it still stands up to scrutiny.

 | product/productId: 0792844017 | review/userId: A3V5OR76MAFDMJ | review/summary: Decent Film But Shamelessly Revisionist | review/text: This movie is not awful, and the plot, musical score and acting performances are in many cases quite decent.  However, it contains a wildly inaccurate, revisionistic depiction of the political affiliations of the  various Yugoslav guerrillas.<p>First, the movie depicts the CHETNIKS as  pro-German.  NOTHING could be further from the truth.  The Chetniks were  anti-Communist, pro-Allied officers (led by Draza Mihailovic) who fought  against the Wehrmacht in an attempt to restore the Yugoslav monarchy and  the duly constituted government overthrown by the Germans in 1941.  They  had a generally western political orientation and were predominantly Serb.  The USTASHE (headed by Ante Pavelic), on the other hand, were pro-Nazi and  anti-Chetnik.  They were overwhelmingly made up of Croatian nationalists  and fought alongside the German army against the Chetniks and the Allies  throughout the 1941-45 Yugoslav campaign.<p>The Communist PARTISANS  (fronted by Josip Broz Tito) were pro-Soviet.  Although Tito was a Croat,  the partisans were principally Serb and fought against both the Chetniks  and the Ustashe.  They were far more reckless than the Chetniks in their  fight against the Germans, and as a result their tactics invited the  typically bloody German reprisals against the Yugoslav people as a whole.  At the end of the war, the partisans turned their (Soviet supplied) arms  against the Chetniks in a civil war against the Yugoslav government and  brutally communized the war-weary nation, executing Mihailovic shortly  afterward.  The present-day Serbian government of Slobodan Milosevic is the  ideological heir of Tito, and the often savage events in the Balkans since  June 25, 1991 serve to prove how intolerant these people are against any  group who seeks freedom, peace and independence from Belgrade.<p>Since even  a casual student of WW2 knows the distinction between these groups, the  only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that the makers of this movie  (which must have been reviewed by and acceptable to Yugoslavia's Communist  government in 1978) purposely sought to distort the truth.<p>By maligning  the Chetniks in such a manner, this movie does a disservice to all Balkan  peoples - as well as to the Allied soldiers who fought alongside them in  WW2.  If this film were edited and every use of the word  &quot;Chetnik&quot; was replaced by &quot;Ustashe&quot;, then this  injustice would be properly dealt with.

 | product/productId: 0767802519 | review/userId: A2ZX6GW8WL5AG3 | review/summary: Superb "Shoot-em-Up"/Redemption Tale | review/text: Mathilda is a bright 12 year old girl living with her awful family in a rundown tenement. She is emotionally ignored and physically beaten by her dope slinger father, her stepmother who dresses like a prostitute and her sister who seems to spend her life tightening her buttocks muscles to aerobices videos.<br />Mathilda's neighbor Leon is a quiet, brooding loner who performs mob hits through local mob contact Danny Aiello, who takes advantage of Leon's lack of education and language skills. Leon radiates disillusionment with his trade, but seems locked into what he does and does well.<br />Leon strikes a fatherly friendship with Mathilda; he taking pity on the sweet child and her unfortunate enviroment; she sadly desperate for stability and caring in her cruel world.<br />When renegade DEA man Gary Oldman and his combo posse of rogue agents and street thugs slaughter Mathildas family, Leon and Mathilda are forced together. Oldman soon comes to realize a witness from the apartment masscre may be alive.Little Mathilda becomes Oldmans target and detatched Leon's lonely life is invigorated as he uses his talent with firearms with his newfound role of paternal protecter of his charge.<br />Oldmans performance as a pill-popping dirty dealing cop is over the edge and the double life he leads somewhat incredible as he eases between dope ripoff and legit cop work without fear of detection. Jean Reno is superb in the silence and solitude of a borderline depressed thug who is probably raked with internal conflict over his line of work. Natalie Portman is Oscar material as a child who tries to be tough but in the end can only do what a child can do. Portmans portrayal is remarkably touching without being cloying or pandering and will probably warm the hearts of many who rent this for the gunplay.<br />GREAT FILM!!

But when one lady named Weena, starts to drown, he sees that no one seems to care. He rescues her, and after talking to the other youths, he learns that they learned nothing from their ancient ancestors.<p>The books they have are old and buried.<p>They have lived the good the life, based on the sacrifices from mankind, and they don't appreciate it (which is another accurate telling of today's times).<p>He learns that Weena is part of the Eloi society which is under the slavery of the Morlocks, a cannibalistic race.<p>The Morlocks give everything, food and clothing to the Eloi , in exchange for the slavery and their bodies as food.<p>The movie was directed by sci fi whiz George Pal who won an impressive 7 oscars and awards for his movies.<p>He is the Steven Spielberg when it comes to sci fi movies.<p>What's astonishing about the film is the special effects that were made without computer help (which in most movies make the movie look more fake than real).<p>The way the special effects people made flowers bloom, candles burn while the Time Machine went in time, is very special to see.<p>It's a great site, from a special effects view, how these people managed to do these effects, with the limited resources they had.<p>He directed &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Destination Moon&quot; which won numerous awards. DVD comes with a number of great features:<p>A behind the scenes documentary with Rod Taylor. A great documentary where he shows how George Pal designed the machine. Taylor even shows us storyboards which haven't been seen in 30 yrs.<p>Even the DVD main menu with Taylor on the cover and the Murlocks in the background, give the DVD a great sci fi look!!
 | product/productId: 1572523557 | review/userId: A21ZB4GEHW6B8E | review/summary: Don't Make A Habit of It | review/text: The main issues I have with this film are summarized by the Amazon "editorial" review:  "Habit is a modest, intelligent study of loneliness, addiction, and urban alienation."<br /><br />Missing from that sentence is the word "vampire," and throughout much of this film, particularly the first half of it, I wondered where the vampire(s) might be, and if she, he, or they would ever make more than a token appearance on camera.<br /><br />Furthermore, "...this 1997 tale of urban vampirism, overlooked in the wake of two similar productions, Michael Almereyda's Nadja and Abel Ferrara's The Addiction...(is) less precious than the former and less pretentious than the latter..."<br /><br />Nadja features the superb Elina Lowensohn and actually puts a few things on screen worthy of hyperbole.  The Addiction might seem "pretentious" but only if you see nothing entertaining in the concept of a Christopher Walken portraying a vampire who spouts off like a graduate student in philosophy.<br /><br />And what the Amazon reviewer fails to acknowledge is that Nadja and The Addiction are both vampire films.  The main point is vampires.  It's all about the vampires.  Habit, by comparison, "...periodically loses itself in side stories..." which have nothing to do with vampires or anything but protagonist Sam's sad, alcoholic life, and frankly if you replaced the vampire with a kinky dominatrix you would have the same film.<br /><br />And, of course, because Habit is "art," rather than merely a "movie," many of the film's flaws are explained away by the "pretense" of a director (and reviews not my own) playing coy with the audience over the question of whether the vampire is really a vampire, or if the only thing "supernatural" in the film is happening inside Sam's head.<br /><br />Well, right on the box cover it says, "The most believable VAMPIRE flick I have ever seen -- Chicago Tribune."  Sadly, not enough of a VAMPIRE flick for me.<br /><br />Also, I would hesitate to describe Habit as "...a compelling paranoid psychodrama..." because the film seems rather to define the problem of a self-indulgent screenplay.
 | product/productId: 0769403468 | review/userId: A32VRF08ZAVP1E | review/summary: "Keep off of this child!" | review/text: The one memory of the film "A Night To Remember" that stands out strongest in my memory is the scene, right before the Titanic founders, of a very thin gaunt man encountering a small little boy who has become separated form his mother. The man, having a near skeletal white face, says "Well we had better try to find her, hadn't we?" and he commits himself to staying with the little boy to the very end.<br /><br />A bit later, we see him protecting the little boy, demanding of other frantic passengers crowding around them to "Keep off of this Child!" as he comforts and protects the little boy right to the end, knowing full well that they are going to die together.<br /><br />That scene, however fictional it might be, or however real it might be, is the one part of the film "A Night To Remember" that remains most seared into my mind, and it, above all else, underscores the tragedy of the real disaster, far more than any soap opera inspired fictional love story could ever do.<br /><br />"Titanic" [1997] and this film make good companion pieces, if you want to see a great visual depiction of what really happened to the ship as it sank, you have the latter film, but this one remains the definitive film about human events that unfolded the night the Titanic went down.<br /><br />I highly recommend both Walter Lord's original book "A Night To Remember" upon which this film is based, and also his follow-up book "The Night Lives On".<br /><br />There is an inspiring chapter in the latter book titled "The Electric Spark" that captures the heroism of the Captain of the rescue ship Carpathia, Arthur Rostron, whose actions that night would eventually lead to him being knighted.<br /><br />Buy this film - you will not regret it!
 | product/productId: 6300215962 | review/userId: A360T3EFUHE3FR | review/summary: Paul Newman Deserved The Oscar For This | review/text: It was "politically correct" in 1964 to give the Oscar to Sidney Poitier for "Lillies of the Field."  Too bad, the best performance of 1963 was Paul Newman's in "Hud."  Mr. Poitier has done wonderful work in other films, but this should have been Newman's year.<br /><br />His performance as Hud is one of the BEST in the history of film. His movements, his every gesture or glance captured that character.  He was the heel of heels; an oversexed cad who used women with no regard for their feelings and only cared about his personal carnal cravings; he cared nothing for the emotions of others, except maybe, his father's or the nephew he genuinely loved.<br /><br />Patricia Neal was wonderful in support (strangely, she was nominated and won in the "best actress" category) and, likewise, delivered a perfect acting job.  Melvyn Douglass deserved the Oscar he won as Hud's father and Brandon DeWilde was incredible as Hud's nephew.<br /><br />I must have this on DVD.

It has a &quot;Hitchcock&quot; subtleness about it.  If you are a horror fan of the &quot;TRUE&quot; sense, and not out for &quot;blood and guts&quot; this is YOUR kind of movie!  This type of horror film has not occured since &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane&quot;, &quot;Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;, or &quot;Straight Jacket&quot;.  The acting is believable and the direction was done with superb technique...a must see!!

It explores Dian Fossey's life in Africa during her struggle to save the gorilla population, whom were close to extinction.  The producers and the writers wonderfully desplict the emotional value of the times: determination, leadership, loneliness, love, friendship, and many more.  The movie events are accurate to the actual events.  Their research on the gorillas and Dian Fossey proves well thorough.  Sigourney Weaver plays Fossey beautifully in her well-deserved Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated role(Best Actress).  Her every drop of heart and soul is poured into the character in every scene.  No other actress could perform this role at this level.  All other actors also performed their roles wonderfully.  &quot;Gorillas In the Mist&quot; is a triumphant movie perfect for all audiences.  This film will be a classic in a few years.

 | product/productId: 6300184277 | review/userId: A2CUWCJHUPGL9W | review/summary: Excellent children's reading! | review/text: I somehow missed this book as a child, so I was happy to get a copy to review now, as I have been trying to catch up on the childhood reading classics that I didn't get to.<br /><br />This edition is in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the novel, and it has a wonderful forward by Lois Lowry.  This story is about the power of the human spirit to overcome complete adversary.  While not spoiled by the comforts of the more "civilized' world, Karana, the heroine, is still just a child, and a female child at that, unallowed by her society to do many thngs.  Isolated and distraught by the death of her brother, she is able to move forward, the survival instinct kicking in, allowing her to create a life for herself on the island that has been deserted by the villagers.  Karana is so resourceful and brave, one can only admire her.<br /><br />Beautifully crafted, the writing is moving and elegant and spare, like Karana's life.  She is able to make friends, with the wild dogs on the island and even otters and birds and even another girl, but she is haunted by lonlieness.  Every child should read this book, as should most adults.  I had no idea it was also based on a true story, which makes me curious to learn more.  Great reading.
 | product/productId: 0800141601 | review/userId: AECVYXIL9791R | review/summary: Camelot needs a new costume designer and head of security! | review/text: After the brutal first few minutes of the film, I thought it was going to be a more realistic telling of the Arthurian legend; it turned out to be quite the opposite, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />The Good:  The (unrequited) love between Lancelot and Guinevere is more understandable given that Arthur is depicted as being a contemporary of Guinevere's father, and easily old enough to be her father, if not her grandfather, whereas Lancelot is young and very heroic and dashing.  Even so, there is genuine affection between Arthur and Guinevere, and she never breaks her marriage vows, either during the betrothal or during the marriage.  I also like the way Lancelot is depicted.  He is more human; he is not the font of virtue he is depicted as in other versions of the legend.  His association first with Guinevere and then with Arthur has an enobling effect on him, making him a better man at the end of the film than at the beginning.  Also, the evil knight Malagant is played wonderfully by Ben Cross.<br /><br />The Bad:  Where in the world did they get those hideous royal blue uniforms?  They look like something out of a Star Trek movie (or TV series).  It is unusual that costuming makes or breaks a film, but these awful costumes almost single-handedly destroyed the film and any credibility it might have had.  I was trying to watch the film and I kept being distracted by how terrible those blue uniforms were.  The other thing was, Camelot seriously needs a new head of security.  First, they nearly let Guinvere be captured on her trip to Camelot to be married, then they let her be effortlessly kidnapped from Camelot, whisked away as if by magic, then they let Malagant's army waltz right into the city without a fight.  Hello?  King Arthur wouldn't have lived long enough to have gray hair if he was this sloppy about security.<br /><br />Still, I felt the good outweighed the bad in this interesting retelling of the Camelot legend.
 | product/productId: 0800185226 | review/userId: A2TXR85WQLE32N | review/summary: A Man for All Seasons for one reason.... | review/text: 1966's Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, "A Man for All Seasons" is the story of Sir Thomas Moore, counselor to King Henry VIII of England but a devout man of God first.  This ordering of priorities places an dreadful air of inevitability over Director Fred Zinneman's austere but moving production, which features a talented cast and the superb dialogue from the play of the same name.<br /><br />Henry VIII (played with egotistical gusto by Robert Shaw) wishes to divorce Catherine of Aragon, who had been unable to bear him a son and heir.  The Catholic Church declines to grant him a divorce.  The King demands the support of Sir Thomas More (Paul Schofield), his Chancellor since the death of Cardinal Woolsey (Orson Welles).  Moore, a devout and relentlessly honest man, resists the King's demand.  Henry will tolerate no resistance on this matter, and Moore's enemies, including the schemer Cromwell (Leo McKern) and an ambitious young man (John Hurt) will frame him, leading to his trial and death for treason.<br /><br />"A Man for All Seasons" poses a number of provocative moral challenges, not least the sagacity of Moore's refusal to bend to the King, at the cost of his life and his family's welfare.  A question not pursued by the movie is why Moore, an experienced man of government, would not take reasonable measures to defend himself against betrayal in a time of rough and tumble court politics, where the price of failure might be death.  This refusal makes for a cleaner but less historically accurate story line<br /><br />This movie is very highly reocmmended as a superbly done drama, still worth watching all these many years later.
 | product/productId: 6302269431 | review/userId: A26ZSYRPA1TCI5 | review/summary: Great adventure with a comic-book feel | review/text: "The Rocketeer", Disney's 1991 adventure film based on the successful comic book by Dave Stevens, is tons of fun. In spirit and execution, it resembles the 1999 Universal film "The Mummy". Both movies have a 1930s sensibility (perhaps because both are set in that era) with regard to pacing, action scenes, and cinemetography.<br /><br />There are no shades of grey here. The villains (Nazis) are pure evil, and the heroes are purely good. Jennifer Connelly and Bill Campbell shine as the "good guys", and Timothy Dalton turns in a devilish performance as the turncoat actor Neville Sinclair.<br /><br />The only downside to this family-suitable adventure is the paucity of scenes featuring Campbell in the "Rocketeer" costume and backpack. With its huge budget, you'd think Disney could have squeezed in some extra eye-popping footage of the titular character in action. But be assured, when he does appear, and the action begins to heat up, you will be on the edge of your seat, reaching for the popcorn.
 | product/productId: 078321667X | review/userId: A1TAWJ2PA3USVX | review/summary: Good for the Kids--and the Adults | review/text: Babe is an endearing tale of a talking pig--an a lot of other talking animals--on an eccentric farm run by eccentric Farmer Hoggett.  The plot is quirky and funny, and, yes, rather heartwarming, though it has sad moments, too.<br /><br />Filmed in Australia, the film has enough of the 'place' taken out' that kids from many lands will watch this and think they are seeing their homeland.  That, and the sensational computer-aided talking animal effects, will make the film a must-see for kids under ten.<br /><br />But, wait; Babe is quirky and fun enough that adults will enjoy it, too.  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was caught sneaking out of the theater according to the Washington Post, if I recall!  If he can see Babe, so can you.<br /><br />As an adult, you'll probably love two things.  First, there's an inspiring sound track revolving around variations of Camille Saint-Saen's Organ Symphony.  Next, there's James Cromwell's Oscar-nominated performance as tight-lipped Farmer Hoggett.  If you have only become familiar with this wonderful actor for more recent roles such as the demented new husband in "Six Feet Under" or the crooked Irish police captain in "LA Confidential," this role will surprise and delight you.  The scene where he hoofs and sings the theme song to cheer up Babe the Pig is a delight, evolving from a scratchy lullaby to a sailor's hornpipe, to a full symphonic rendition!  That alone is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />And, yes, one star off for sub-optimal DVD quality, but it isn't that bad.  By all means order this if you haven't seen it!
 | product/productId: 0780622642 | review/userId: A3VLX5Z090RQ0V | review/summary: Middling Space Adventure | review/text: Like "I Hate Valentine's Day" before it, I have to make another ratings dispute.  Why is "Lost is Space" rated PG-13 when this about as family-friendly PG as it can get?  Alright, so the monsters in this movie gets splattered with blue goo, but I doubt the kids would bat an eyes over blueberry gunk; in fact, if the monsters bleed green goo, this would be a Nickelodeon movie.  The characters do curse the 's' word (though I don't see why that's necessary), but only twice and it's not as much as that in "Warriors of Virtue".  Finally, there's not much in way of intense violence either.  Most of the film is productively child-oriented, from having the ugly badly-CGI alien existing to be a 'cute' mascot, Will Robinson taking plenty of screen time to do rascally scientific things and controlling a robot during videogame-like sequence, and Penny Robinson sounds like she's in a Chip & Dale cartoon.  Given these elements and how apparently campy the original TV series was, I find this movie pretentious in trying to be edgy.<br /><br />"Lost In Space" is a lackluster adaptation with many discernible flaws.  Thanks to William Hurt and Matt LeBlanc, they deliver one of the most monotonous performances ever in films.  The vanilla romantic plot between LeBlanc and Heather Graham was hammy and forced, given the obnoxious smug nature of LeBlanc and dopey predictable attitude from Graham.  The special effects didn't age well over the years; although the background shots were nice, the monsters looked so badly-done and the flashy filter effects stood out too much. Whatever tension it has, it was superficial, which didn't help by the fact that the characters constantly spout one-liners. Finally, there was a time-travel plot that's cluttered by its own set-up and convenient by its own execution.<br /><br />However, for being a soulless, manufactured blockbuster, I'm not berating it too much.  Outside the weird time-travel plot, the story is straightforward and harmless (and by harmless, I mean the movie didn't make me want to cause harm to others).  The film is what it set out to be, a cash grab; at least it's a watchable one.
 | product/productId: 6301581067 | review/userId: A216HUVSVAL3R1 | review/summary: An unparalled work of brilliance. | review/text: I cannot say enough about my love for Metropolis, or the sheer joy I felt upon hearing about this restoration. I LOVE Metropolis. It offers a still unique vision of the future, and frankly impressive special effects, and a central melodrama certain to entertain. This is Lang's masterpiece.<br /><br />It has a wonderful soundtrack that resonates deeply with its images. It will stick with you.<br /><br />While the film is intensely entertaining, its message is often found confusing. Is it pro-communist, or anti-communist? Its simpler than that. It calls for basic human decency to connect those in power with those underneath them. That is a simplistic message, but one that I think will always hold resonance.
 | product/productId: 0767821629 | review/userId: AZ112BVVTCYX1 | review/summary: This is still a good movie, but not up to today's standards | review/text: That said, I saw this in theaters when it first came out.  Maybe a different decade, maybe a hot woman, maybe never seeing the lead actor in end up in scary movie 4.  Something really hit home with me.  Now, I see what terrible acting was involved in this movie.  If you like movies for the concepts they deliver, you will like this one for going deeper into the sci-fi end of the matrix concept.  Drama galore, film noir.  Probably already seen it yourself or you wouldn't be looking at it on Amazon.  Reminder, Vincent Denofrio is the only good actor in this movie... no brainer, right.  And you should know not to purchase the 1.33 aspect ratio version like I did.
 | product/productId: 6302229928 | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: Much more than tongue and cheek... | review/text: Jiri Menzel's `Ostre Sledovane Vlaky' has been heralded as one of the definitive films of the 60's, a deliciously engrossing `coming of age' story that mixes enough humor with drama to create a beautifully complete depiction of life.  It reminds me somewhat of `Lasky Jedne Plavovlasky' and the brilliant `Le Souffle au Coeur' in that it uses natural adolescent curiosity to elaborate on even deeper and more mature revelations.<br /><br />In `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' we are introduced to young Milos.  Milos is a young, nave virgin.  I want to make something clear.  One particular reviewer accused this movie of being nothing more than an exploitive message to viewers that promiscuity is acceptable and expected.  That is not the case.  This film doesn't endorse this action (the character of Josef alone somewhat shows a condemning attitude towards this course) but it simply uses it as a way to explore the insecurities and very real fears of adolescence.  Young men especially are raked with these very curiosities, and the feeling of inadequacy, especially in the intimacy department, can scare a man for life.  `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' merely uses this avenue of life to serve as a foundation for deeper character development.  I just felt the need to say that, since this reviewers ignorance irritated me.  So, back to the movie.  Milos is young and questioning his ability to perform (as a man).  The thing is, his insecurities run deeper than a mere intimacy problem, but he's not really aware of anything else at his young age.  Taken under the wing of middle-aged rebel (and ladykiller) Hubicka, Milos gets a crash course in the ways of love, which he attempts to use on the beautiful Masa.<br /><br />Yes, there is a political turn in the film towards the end, which I won't elaborate on so as not to ruin anything for the viewer, but I will say that this point is one that the reviewer I mentioned failed to notice.  This turn of events (which he claimed as pointless) is the crux of the film, for it shows how the director's use of intimacy was merely a mask for greater things.<br /><br />The acting here is astonishing, especially from the supporting players.  That isn't to say that Vaclav Neckar isn't wonderful as young Milos, but Josef Somr and Jitka Scoffin are just brilliant.  Somr especially takes a very despicable character and makes him likable and enjoyable.  Despite the fact that the actions taken by Hubicka are at times reprehensible, the charismatic way in which he carries them out (that stamp scene is just marvelous) make him delightful almost.  Scoffin is far more than a pretty face here (she is stunning), for she uses a mixture of restrained sensuality and nave awkwardness to flesh out the object of Milos' affections.<br /><br />With a cheeky humor that makes the more serious aspects of the film stand out, `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' is a must see for any fan of foreign film, coming of age stories or humorous splices of human drama.  It is a beautiful and sincere film that lives up to the hype.

 | product/productId: 0784011389 | review/userId: A4P0MF6XZ6NFC | review/summary: An exciting and super-charged sequel | review/text: As I said in my review of &quot;First Blood&quot;, these movies are so much more than machine guns and explosions. There is so much truth portrayed in them about the Vietnam war, what is really was, and it's affect on men like John Rambo. Rambo is not at all a bad person, but rather a kind one who tries to get his life together after the war. Here he is released from workhouse prison by his friend and mentor, Col. Trautman, to rescue POW's in the jungles of 'nam. I won't put any spoilers in my review here, or anybody who hasn't seen this excellent sequel, but I'll use a quote from Trautman to the scumbag Murdock, &quot;You act as if you're dealing with an ordinary man here.&quot;  George P. Cosmatos's directing is superb, and stays in the middle of the action. The tension and drama isn't silly or bogus; it's superb in my opinion. Cosmatos would later go on to direct the modern-day classic Western, &quot;Tombstone&quot;. Buy this movie today. In my opinion, it offers hope and courage that combats the Vietnam fiasco. It's anti-war piece....showing that war really is hell. It also shows there are many true patriots, men like Rambo and Trautman.

 | product/productId: 0767843258 | review/userId: A2UIFACS5MJH1N | review/summary: Every atom of our bodies was once part of a star | review/text: An inspirational movie about the victory of the human spirit over the imperfections of the body. A young man, who was born with a medical condition on his heart, wants to be a space pilot. But his health characteristics are not as good as they should be.<br /><br />He is not tall enough, his vision is not good enough, so he is "invalid". Nevertheless, he is determined to enter the space navigator academy (Gattaca) by using a false identity. By using false blood samples, false fingerprints, etc. (borrowed by a suitable "valid" person), he passes the tests and is approved to be a space pilot on a mission to Titan. At the very end before the flight, his true identity is discovered by one doctor, but the doctor sympatshises with his dreams and allows him to fly in space. The donor of the blood samples, unfortunately, commits a suicide, because he was confined in a wheelchair and probably got tired of living like a cripple.<br /><br />The movie really suggests that by training our mind and body (and using some help from our friends) we can achieve our dreams, regardless of the unfavorable conditions that we were born with.<br /><br />I recomend the movie, because the story is really dreamy, and also the actors and the actress (Uma Thurman) are very good looking, and the building facilities of the training center Gattaca are really beautiful and futuristic. If you have to pass some tests in your life in order to get accepted for your dream university or a dream job - then you should see this movie. Don't let anything stop you on your way to success - such is the message of the movie.<br /><br />The idea of using a false idendity is fraudulent of course, but as the proverb says: "The purpose justifies the means".<br /><br />And all is well if it ends well. These are the movie's main ideas.

My suggestion is to read the book, digest it for a month or two and then watch this mini-series.  Duvall &amp; Tommy Lee Jones are perfect as Gus &amp; Call.  The scenes are faithful to the book.  The soundtrack is breathtaking.  The one weak spot is the casting Frederic Forrest (an otherwise very capable actor)as Blue Duck.  He does not bring the menace that was so haunting in the novel.

Joe.  However, this movie is terrible. God Awful.  Unspeakably poor.  However, therein lies its charm.  The plot is paper thin, yet impossible to clearly follow.  The acting is perhaps some of the worst to ever grace the silver screen.  The effects are poor, and if you want the WORST blue screen effects shot EVER (!) be sure to stay to "exciting" finale.  Yet, as a small child, the movie was quite fun.  And now, with the whole being so ridiculous, I can easily get through the movie from laughter.  [The first time I showed it to a friend with a rather discriminating cinematic taste, he nearly passed out from laughter.  Think "silent scream" laughing, in the fetal position, on the floor].<br /><br />Its really simple, do you want a farce to watch with friends to ridicule and have a good time?  This IS the movie for you.  Are you looking for entertainment while watching a movie alone? Avoid Megaforce at all costs.<br /><br />A big fat "thumb kiss" to all you Megaforce fans!

 | product/productId: 0783114222 | review/userId: A13NM1PES9OXVN | review/summary: A Voyage Most of us Only Dream of... | review/text: First off, if I could give this miniseries 10, 20, a zillion stars, I would.  Amazon just didn't let me count high enough.<p>So let me get ahold  of myself long enough to tell you to run, run, run and get this DVD set  now, if you haven't already.  &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; is one  of the most unique and engrossing (as well as gorgeously produced)  miniseries I've ever seen -- 12 hours of moving, dramatic, gripping,  frightening, and ultimately completely inspiring entertainment.  As a kid  born in the late sixties, I missed the moon race (and I'm still ticked  about it).  But this literally perfect 12-episode miniseries makes me feel  as if I've been there too -- from the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumphs  and near-misses of the ensuing missions, to the vastly underappreciated  final Apollo 16 and 17 missions. (As one character in the film laments,  &quot;We stopped going up just when we were getting really good at  it.&quot;)<p>Those of you who might have avoided this because it's  &quot;history&quot; -- let me reassure you right now that it's as gripping  as any drama you'll see in or out of a theatre.  This isn't just history  painstakingly created by some of those who were there -- it's also just  plain incredible, suspenseful, joyful entertainment.  <p>And for those of  you who saw it on HBO, the DVD set is well worth the price, even if you'd  already taped it. The DVD set offers not only crystal-clear viewing you'd  expect (and the special effects hold up admirably under the discerning eye  offered through DVD), but also special features including an enjoyable  making-of featurette (emphasizing Tom Hanks' huge role in bringing the  project to the screen), plus behind-the-scenes studies of special effects,  3D ship models (which can be rotated or even viewed in wireframe), a  transcript of Kennedy's &quot;We Choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech, a  follow-up quiz, and a virtual tour of the solar system.  And that's just  for starters.<p>The writing, acting, music, direction and more are all  simply superb -- each hour out of the twelve having its own particular look  and feel, while nevertheless meshing perfectly with the others. The  introductions to each chapter in Apollo history are delivered quietly, but  with eloquence and power, by the project's producer, co-writer, actor (and  driving force) Tom Hanks.<p>One of my favorite aspects of the project was  the way it brought in so many actors who are often underused (or at least  under-appreciated) in TV and film today -- many of whom are cast against  type to show what they can really do.  Stephen Root, a guy I'd loved as  Jimmy James on NewsRadio for years, does a terrific job in a serious role  as Mission Control's Chris Kraft, as does Nick Searcy in a quiet and often  sensitive turn as the program's father figure Deke Slayton.  Meanwhile,  Stephen Root's former NewsRadio news director Dave Foley also gets in on  the action, and gets to shed his &quot;Kids in the Hall&quot; cynicism with  a surprisingly sweet and innocent portrayal of Al Bean.<p>Other favorites  out of the dozens of amazing actors include Ted Levine's wistful, complex  (not to mention curmudgeonly) Alan Shepard, the criminally underused Jo  Anderson's sensitive and moving Pat White (wife of Gemini and Apollo I  astronaut Ed White), and memorable appearances large and small by such  gifted folks as Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Matt Craven, Tim Daly,  Mark Harmon (returning for a few moments to his lighter roots), Paul  McCrane, David Clennon, James Rebhorn, Mark Rolston, Jay Mohr, George  Newbern, Brett Cullen and Steve Zahn.<p>The surprises are the best part.  Before viewing this, I would never have guessed that the Apollo 13  (&quot;We interrupt this Program&quot;) segment, while unique and powerful,  would be my least favorite of the group, while &quot;Spider,&quot; a look  at the development of a *machine*, for goodness' sake, would move me to  tears.  Other standouts (keeping in mind that they're all terrific) include  a quietly powerful look at Apollo I, the trials and surprising fates of the  astronauts' wives in an episode directed by Sally Field, and the  bittersweet old-man-as-underdog battle of Alan Shepard to make it &quot;up  there&quot; one last time -- and for more than 15 minutes.<p>OK, I'll shut  up.  But if you ever have a day when you've encountered a really stupid  driver, or been detained in ridiculous meetings with half-brained bozos, or  wondered if human beings aren't actually DE-volving -- then this miniseries  is just the kind of thing to remind you of what human beings can be at  their very best. And what wonders they are capable of.<p>And I can't  believe I missed it all.  We just better go back.  Darn it.<p>NOTE: For  those of you inspired by the miniseries, I strongly urge you to go pick up  Andrew Chaikin's wonderful &quot;A Man on the Moon,&quot; the history of  Apollo that provided much of the backbone for the miniseries.  And for an  even closer look at the moon, don't miss &quot;Full Moon&quot; (Michael  Light and Andrew Chaikin) -- a truly stunning, beautiful, even eerie  compilation of lunar photographs, many of which had never before been seen.
 | product/productId: 6300269752 | review/userId: A1N7ZQGH4VJV7Z | review/summary: Better late on DVD than never! | review/text: A must for my DVD collection!<p>This bitter-sweet film follows the life and times of T.S. Garp, a fatherless boy brought up by his nurse-mother Jenny Fields. This film adaptation of Irving's book follows Garp in every stage of his life.  The performances by Williams, Lithgow and Close are sincere and memorable. <p>The film is a bit different than the book.  Garp's years in Europe (in the book) are encapsulated in a brief scene with Swoosie Kurtz and also unlike the book, there is no &quot;Epilogue.&quot;  But the film succeeds wonderfully in capturing the tone of the book.  Personally, I'd recommend watching the film before reading the book.<p>Watch for cameo appearances by Jessica Tandy and Hume Crownyn (Jenny's parents) as well as a cameo by the author himself (as the wrestling referee).

We particularly love the animation of the countryside, the woods, and the relationships between the two girls and the old grandmother.<br /><br />Most importantly, we give this movie the parental "stamp of approval."  My four-year-old girls love this movie!  The first time they watched it the Soot Gremlins scared them, but in subsequent viewings they thought they were funny. (Which, ultimately, they are.)<br /><br />Not all of Miyazaki's movies are good for all ages. This one is.

I watch this DVD  almost every other day. Everyone in my family just dies with laughter. This  DVD features great classic skits from the early years of the ever popular  HBO hit t.v. show. Everytime I think about this DVD,I can't help but laugh  while I pop it in the DVD player to watch the show again. Buy this DVD, its  well worth it. And the price is also another reason why this &quot;Best Of  Chris Rock Show is a best buy. How can you go wrong this is Chris Rock, buy  it- buy it- buy it.
 | product/productId: 0783239424 | review/userId: A2BPDFR58H9575 | review/summary: Guess Who Is Coming To  Dinner | review/text: A group of well-to-do snobbish and obnoxious professionals have dinner parties every Wednesday to which each of them is required to bring an "idiot" as a guest. The victims have no idea that they are invited merely to be humiliated and their boorish "sponsors" compare their notes later to determine whose "idiot" was the best. Pierre Brochant( Thierry Lhermitte), the smug publisher thinks that he's got a winner in the tax accountant Franois Pignon (Jacques Villeret, sadly passed away in January 2005 - great French Comedian whose performance in "Robert and Robert" I enjoyed very much) who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre (but fortunately for us, the viewers) he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon's sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...<br /><br />With the modest running time of 80 minutes, the "Dinner Game" is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber, the director of Le Jouet, (1976) aka The Toy , La Ch&egrave;vre, (1981) aka Knock On Wood, Les Comp&egrave;res, (1983) ... aka ComDads, and Les Fugitifs, (1986) and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire, (1972) ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.<br /><br />4.5/5

Every time I see this film it's like I'm watching it for the first time. The concept of genetic engineering is one that intrigues me, and this film is a great snapshot into what could very well be the near future. As was said in Jurassic Park, life always finds a way, and this story reaffirms the notion that we don't have quite as much power over nature as we sometimes believe.

 | product/productId: 630105573X | review/userId: A15F68X8CR6IZG | review/summary: A Forgotten Classic | review/text: The first time I ever saw this film was just last year when I was 15 years old. I had never even heard about it until I watched the Making of Saving Private Ryan. This documentary played a clip of some of Steven Spielberg's  movies set during World War 2. <p>When I heard the beautiful John Williams'  score play on my TV and a boy watching a lone fighter plane soar across the  runway, I was immediately captivated and sat in awe as this boy cheered on  the fighter plane. I immediately rewound the tape and read the title of  this clip: Empire of the Sun.<p>I quickly ran to my local Blockbuster and  rented the movie not even knowing what the film was about and was witnessed  to the most amazing film I had ever seen!  <p>The performances were top  notch and the performance from the young Christian Bale, who plays the  young boy, Jim, forced in a Japanese Intern Camp, is the greatest  performance by a child I have ever seen, exceeding that of such names as  Henry Thomas (E.T.) and young oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth  Sense).<p>The movie itself is a visual masterpiece with never a dull  moment. This movie contains some of the most memorable and beuatiful scenes  I have ever seen anywhere. The story itself is full of drama, action, and  suspence that captures your heart and never lets go even after the end  credits are rolling! <p>As usual, John Williams delivers with one of his  greatest scores ever. The visual effects are astounding and perfectly  executed to enhance the storytelling of the movie. <p>I disagree with some  of the negative reviews that plague this underrated epic. Many people  before its release expected it to be this huge blockbuster stemming off as  an adaptation of a book by the same name. How can anyone expect a movie  about a boy torn from his parents and forced to live in a Japanese Prison  Camp, get cursed and beaten at and forced to eat bugs and potatoes for  years to be a huge blockbuster. Many people attacked it for its lack of  commercial success. <p>While this may not be the most historically accurate  film in the case of how horrific the conditions of the prison camps really  were, this would only destract the audiance from what the film should be  and is, a film that begins tragically but ends up being a coming of age  heartwarming epic drama about a boy forced to live and grow up fast under  the harshest of conditions and yet triumphs against all obstacles.

That being said, I found this to be a very good story produced by one of America's best corporate sponsors of family entertainment!<br /><br />For those who have enjoyed the work of Irina Brook and Colin Firth for many years look for her and his brief appearance!<br /><br />The beginning may be a little dark and frightening to very small children, those below the age of 6-8, the film does become much more bright and more up-lifting as the story unfolds.<br /><br />I recommend this title to all families that worry and are concerned about what their children are learning from todays movie titles and the adult content they are introducing to our young.

But what I wasn't prepared for, was how astonishingly beautiful it is on DVD.  On my computer's 19&quot; monitor, it was as clear, crisp and  sharp as it would have been on the &quot;silver screen.&quot;  A TV really  doesn't do justice to a film like this.  Again and again my wife and I  found ourselves gasping at the perfection and beauty of the cinematography,  the lighting, the sets, the shots, the angles...  Even on a big-screen TV,  you only see a faint hint of this film's real beauty; but the DVD brings it  out in a way that only people who saw it in the theaters back in 1943 ever  got to see... until now.  Get a big monitor, a fast computer, and a good  sound system.  Then pop some popcorn, and be prepared to be stunned.
 | product/productId: 6301049292 | review/userId: A2582KMXLK2P06 | review/summary: not bad, but very very predictable | review/text: Unfortunately Satisfaction isn't really a memorable movie.  At least, not one you should consider watching.  It's horribly dated, the acting is average at best, and the storyline is dry and unappealing almost the entire way through because it's predictably written.<br /><br />A group of rockstar teenage girls (or rather, young women) wish to embark on a career being a legitimate rock and roll band.  That's it.<br /><br />Along the way they meet a guy who can make their dreams come true, and after they perform a successful gig at a nightclub, their lives change in a hurry.  Except, things happen along the way.  Typical, uninteresting teenage things.<br /><br />It should be no surprise to anyone that more people aren't reviewing such a dated film.<br /><br />The only segments that really caught my attention were the ones that involved the watch dog, and one scene in the beginning where a truck smashes into a van, which then falls into the ocean.  The rest of the film is dominated with a ton of typical 80's cheesy melodrama.  I've noticed 80's melodrama is especially apparent when it concerns teenagers.<br /><br />I grew up watching shows like the Facts of Life and Growing Pains.  No wonder when I reflect back to those 80's years I realize I didn't act like those teenagers at all- this is because they were always portrayed in an exaggerated way in TV shows and movies.<br /><br />Anyway, the only really good moments of Satisfaction come in the way of the performances the girls put on.  I don't know if they really are performing those songs or just acting, but the music *sounded* good at least.<br /><br />Not a particularly good movie.

 | product/productId: 6302415853 | review/userId: ANI1HRYID0LYA | review/summary: BEWARE! of EXTENDED length Blue ray version. | review/text: As others have written, this film will be ranked as one of the classics of all time. I loved every detail of it. No need to repeat the praise of others. However, if you are interested in purchasing this Blue Ray product, you should be aware that this is the extended length version of the film, and it detracts from the beauty of the original. It becomes draggy and a little disjointed. If anything, it proves the importance of good editing in the original. Look for the theatrical release. Four star rating only because of this. I returned it to Amazon and ordered the Blue Ray Region Free edition.<br /><br />***Please not that the above paragraph DOES NOT apply to the Region Free Blue Ray edition.  I expect that it will be the theatrical release. Will update when I receive it.
 | product/productId: 0790741512 | review/userId: A1MLC386V30QVK | review/summary: Oh, What a Classic it is... | review/text: This is not a bad movie, but it is addictive, anyway.<br /><br />It's hard to define why this film, the flaws of which are many, is a classic, but that is what it is. Mel Gibson returns to play Max in the (sort-of) sequel to Mad Max. Plot then gets cheesey, characters are cheesy, the villains (led by the Humungous) is double the cheese, and so on.<br /><br />But if it is cheesy, it more than makes up for it in atmosphere. In a remote part of Australia, the filmmakers create a world entirely their own, and it is generously shared with the audience: a place of simplistic good vs. evil stuff, but a world, nonetheless, and one is drawn into it while viewing the flick. It is that atmosphere, a sense of "somewhere-else" that draws a person in... and keeps us there.<br /><br />Plenty of violence and stunts involving cars, trucks, and the occasional helicopter, too.<br /><br />There is no character development in this movie but, quite simply, there doesn't need to be: every role is perfected from the start, and most of the actors live up to the parts they ae given.

 | product/productId: 0767005651 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: Seven of the best episodes of one of the best TV shows ever | review/text: &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; is a pivotal show in television history, not only because it brought a flinty-realism in terms of both the style and substance of the program, but because it proved that a show could survive despite low Nielsen ratings as long as people with large amounts of disposable income were the ones doing the watching.  Created by Stephen Bochco and Michael Kozoll, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; used cinematic techniques associated with the films of Robert Altman (&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;) with an unusual mixture of drama and comedy, fast-paced and deliberately choppy editing.  Each episode usually began with morning roll call and ended late at night, with several stories interwoven in between.  The seven episodes collected here do an excellent job of providing the very best of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; from start to finish: <p>Episode 1: &quot;Hill Street Station,&quot; (January 15, 1981, written by Michael Kozoll &amp; Steven Bochco) introduces us to beleaguered Captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti), who has to defuse a tense hostage situation despite the aggressive inclinations of the leader of his EATers, Lt. Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking) and the uneasy help of gang leader Jesus Martinez (Trinidad Silva).  Meanwhile, Public Defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamill) tries to find a client lost in the system and boy are we surprised after watching Furillo and Davenport but heads all episode long to learn they are secretly lovers.  Meanwhile, Sgt. Esterhaus (Michael Conrad), confides to Fay Furillo (Barbara Bosson) about his teenage girlfriend.<p>Episode 25: &quot;The World According to Freedom&quot; (January 7, 1982, written by Michael Wagner), has Mick Belker (Bruce Weitz) dealing with the zany self-professed super hero &quot;Captain Freedom&quot; (Dennis Dugan), who simply will not stop trying to help save the day.  Meanwhile, Captain Furillo issues an ultimatum to the gangs after a brutal massacre at a local tavern.  The conclusion of this one will get to you big time because you will not see it coming.<p>Episode 36: &quot;Trial by Fury&quot; (September 30, 1982, written by David Milch) was the season premiere for the third season.  It may be the best single television episode I have ever seen in my life (yes, better than &quot;Love's Labor Lost&quot; on &quot;ER&quot;) and I have used it in my television classes every chance I get.  A nun is raped and murdered, outraging both the citizens on the Hill as well as Furillo and his cops.  The assailant, Celestine Grey and Gerald Chapman, are quickly captured but the lack of evidence that will hold up in court puts a conviction in doubt.  Then Furillo, in a chilling sequence, decides to use the lynch mob outside the precinct to coerce a confession from the assailants, one of whom is Joyce's client.  Television does not get any better than this episode.  It is worth the whole collection just by itself.<p>Episode 71: &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (February 2, 1984, written by Jeffrey Lewis, Michael Wagner, Karen Hall, and Mark Frost) is the memorable episode that deals with death of Sgt. Esterhaus, necessitated by the death of actor Michael Conrad.  The character is celebrated by going out with a bang: he died while making love to Grace (Barbara Babock).  This episode also has Linda Hamilton as Sandy Valpraiso, whose relationship with Joe Coffey (Ed Marino) is shattered when she is raped, and Jane Kaczmarek as Officer Clara Tilsky.  Clearly the opening eulogy is for the actor as well as the character.  <p>Episode 80: &quot;Mayo, Hold the Pickle&quot; (September 27, 1984, writers Jeffrey Lewis &amp; Mark Frost) finds new roll call sergeant Stan Jablonski (Robert Prosky) is called out by a woman while Detective Mayo (Mimi Kuzak) handles a messy assault case against an elderly couple.  Meanwhile, Fay tries to help an out of town couple, played by Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker (soon to be big stars on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;).  But the impressive part of this episode is that Davenport is upset over the impending execution of Celestine Gray, her client in the classic &quot;Trial by Fury&quot; episode from two year's earlier.<p>Episode 118: &quot;Remembrance of Hits Past&quot; (February 13, 1986, written by Walon Green), take us back before the beginning when Furillo is gunned down and Joyce remembers how they met as she waits for him to come out of surgery.  Meanwhile, Norman Buntz (Dennis Franz) and the rest of the cops on the Hill are trying to find the shooter before he finishes the job.  <p>Episode 146: &quot;It Ain't Over Till it's Over&quot; (May 12, 1987, written by Jeffrey Lewis, David Milch and John Romano) is the final episode of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; as rumors fly about what is going to happen to everyone after the station house is gutted by a fire.  Buntz is already on the hot seat after being set up by some bad guys, but Furillo and Sid (Peter Jurasik) are trying to figure out who did it.  Yes, there was &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot; for a while after this one, with Franz and Jurasik putzing around, but this is the grand finale.<p>Without &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; there is no &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; or &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; which in turn would have meant no &quot;E.R.,&quot; no &quot;N.Y.P.D. Blue,&quot; and pretty much no whatever you favorite drama of the last decade has been.  Contemporary adult television comes from THIS program.  It is one of the 10 best ever on television in terms of writing and acting.  &quot;Trial by Fury&quot; is one of the 10 best episodes ever aired on television.  If you missed this one the first time around, then you should try to catch it in syndication.  But if you remember how good it was, then this collection will allow you to savor the show's very best moments.
 | product/productId: 0790751305 | review/userId: A2QG2S19LYJ96 | review/summary: Amazing Transfer!!! | review/text: I am sometimes befuddled by Blu-Ray, there are times when a recently released movies only looks so-so and then there are movies like UNFORGIVEN. Throughout the movie Leone's film savvy can be seen in Eastwood's directing style....the movies opening scene sets a mood. We, the audience, are caught in the rain (which by the way makes you want to grab a blanket and light up the fireplace), and almost immediatly start forming opinions about the key characters including Eastwood who plays a somewhat dark character. The movie is nicely placed with a very predictable but enjoyable plot. As for the Blu-Ray aspect it is a 10 with one exception the movie is so "bright" at times the characters seem to become a part, or "get lost" in the natural shadows. Not sure if that makes sense but you will know what I mean when you watch the movie. The audio is stellar if not exciteable...you will not need surround for this one. The final gunbattle is again dark and clint seems to have no contrast to his environment. This aside this is a must own as it was an instant classic the second it was released.

 | product/productId: 6300215571 | review/userId: A15XEE0T9DC8JL | review/summary: Like finding an old friend | review/text: This was a favorite from childhood.  I was thrilled to find it available through Amazon.  The humor still holds fast, the color is amazing and the brilliance of Sylvia Fine and Danny Kaye shows in almost every scene, between the writing and the acting.  It may be old but it is not dated.  I am happy that, once again, I can whip through "the palace with chalice..." etc.  We watched it with English subtitles on which was very helpful for my husband, who is French speaking.  And I enjoyed the songs even more when I could listen AND read the lyrics.  Great for adults and a wonderful family film.  When Danny Kaye demonstrates to one of the king's men how worldy he is by rattling through several languages, on one level you know it is gibberish, but on another it sounds so French! So German! So Italian!  He was such an outstanding actor:  incredible timing for physical comedy and with a real feel for language.

 | product/productId: 1555260314 | review/userId: AUHG8KSHI529U | review/summary: The third of the Ford / Wayne cavalry films.  Wonderful story and great cast.  ENJOY! | review/text: We are fortunate that this movie got made at all.  John Ford had wanted to make "The Quiet Man" for years and every studio thought it would lose money.  Herb Yates at Republic Pictures, who usually made low budget Westerns, agreed to produce that film if Ford would agree to do a Western with the same principles (Wayne, O'Hara, and some others).  Ford agreed, but pushed for a million dollar budget and put more care into "Rio Grande" than he had to because he cared about anything that carried his name.  Yates figured he could make up for the money he would lose on "The Quiet Man" with this Cavalry film.  Actually, Republic made a ton of money on both films, with "The Quiet Man" becoming their number one film.<br /><br />While this is the third of the so called "Cavalry Trilogy" by John Ford with John Wayne, they are not connected stories.  Even the characters with the same names are not actually connected between films even though they share some traits.  For example, the wonderful tough sergeant played indelibly by Victor McLaglen, was Sgt. Festus Mulcahy in 1948's "Ft. Apache", but Top Sgt. Quincannon in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and Sgt. Major Timothy McCannon in "Rio Grande.  Wayne's characters were Captain Kirby York in Fort Apache, Captain Nathan Brittles in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Lt. Col. Kirby Yorke (note the rank and the `e') in "Rio Grande".  Still, each is a wonderful film and they make a great set.  Just don't think they make a continuous story.<br /><br />This movie is set, obviously, near the U.S. and Mexican border.  Yorke is there to defend the local settlers from the Apaches who raid from Mexico and dash back across the border because Yorke can't follow them into a foreign country.  The story takes on complications when Yorke's son, Jeff shows up as an enlisted man after failing out of West Point.  Yorke has not seen his son in 15 years, but knows he cannot show favoritism for his son.  To make matters even messier, Yorke's wife (Jeff's mother), Kathleen (Maureen O'Hara) shows up to buy her son out of the military.  Neither Yorke nor Jeff will hear of such a thing.  Part of the estrangement is that Yorke fought the Civil War for the Union and Kathleen is from an old Southern family.  As fate would have it, Yorke was ordered to burn down her plantation during the war.<br /><br />I don't want to go into any more of the plot, but the movie has some wonderful and famous scenes such as the Roman Riding done by Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Claude Jarman, Jr (playing Jeff).  The movie has a wonderful mix of action, emotional tension, a difficult romance between Yorke and Kathleen, and some wonderful singing throughout by the Sons of the Pioneers.  If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to enjoy it (even though it is in B&W - which I never mind).  If you haven't seen it in awhile, enjoy it again.<br /><br />The disk has two documentaries on the making of the film and the movie has an alternate sound track with Maureen O'Hara telling her memories of the scenes being shown.<br /><br />Very enjoyable.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI<br /><br />You may also want to see:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599NA">Fort Apache</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599NK">She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JMRD">The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition)</a>

 | product/productId: 080013799X | review/userId: ALSNEZBAYNHG2 | review/summary: AMAZING MOVIE | review/text: I ran this for my movie club. They loved it and found it extremely funny - both those who had seen it long ago and those seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />I thought I might find the movie religiously offensive - but it was not at all offensive.<br /><br />I know the Pythons wanted the movie to be completely absurd and nonsensical pointless.<br /><br />Maybe humans can never reach that without some of themselves showing through.<br /><br /> In fact I thought the movie had some warmth and affection towards King Arthur and the whole story. Also made some good points about society.<br /><br />I think the English have sought the Holy Grail for two thousand years - and still do not know what it exactly is(multiple theories), where it is (let's hope not in France) or even IF it is.<br /><br />So some frustation about it is warrented. SPOILER: I thought bringing modernday characters in showed the lack of progress since 600 AD in finding the Holy Grail.
 | product/productId: 6301008723 | review/userId: A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D | review/summary: an original of it's kind | review/text: What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Well, this is the extended version of the Exorcist and having seen this and the theatrical version I have to recommend going with this one. Though it only has ten mintues of extra footage, the additional scenes are worth it. The movie starts off slow as does the prequel(s) before it but it is not long before it picks up. The effects used for this movie were intense and even a bit frightning at some points and for a movie made during the 70's (before Star Wars anyway) this was probably rare. After having seen Exorcist Beginning, the opening seqeunce for this movie makes sense as does the piece of the demon statue along with the connection between the demon and Father Merrin though you don't see Merrin until the last third of the movie. I strongly recommend seeing Exorcist Beginning before watching this. As for the dvd, it lacks bonus features unlike the special edition dvd. However, the special edition dvd does not give you the option of viewing the extended version though the features on it are nice. I suppose a true exorcist fan would have both though I prefer the extra footage over the bonus features. If you find films about demonic possession entertaining, the Exorcist is recommended.
 | product/productId: 0790750627 | review/userId: A94348BG2Q6FW | review/summary: One of the most brilliant films ever made | review/text: I first learned of this film 20 some odd years ago in an undergrad film studies class.  Since then I have watched it repeatedly, and it only gets better with age.  Cary Grant is his usual suave, drop dead gorgeous self, but is almost playing a parody of the "Cary Grant" type.  The sexual innuendos, slightly lost to me then, are steamier than ever.  Today's filmmakers could learn so much from this masterpiece.  The greatest part of North by Northwest, however, is the trademark Hitchcockian suspense.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, it still brings me to the edge of my seat!

The animation is top of the line and this movie is so much better then Antz. The story begins with ants collecting food for an offering, and then our "hero" manages to trash this cermoney and then trouble begins. The story is well developed and well written and unlike "Antz" we are here spared pseudo political messages and this is good since the movie is after all made for children and not adults. One important message that is sent is to children is to tollerate different people and not to judge people. The music is splendid and the dialogue is right on the money. Highly recommended indeed.

 | product/productId: 6300163520 | review/userId: A2CE48QZ2DSZRH | review/summary: Magical, sublime, groundbreaking comedy!  See it! | review/text: I am moved with joy to the point of tears each time I watch this film.  This movie mark's Jerry Lewis' directing debut.  He was staying as a guest at the Fountainbleu (the setting of the movie) when, inspired by the bell boys there, he spontaneously decided to create this film.  This movie is so rich in comedy, inspiration, and meaning.  &quot;The Bell Boy&quot; is a keeper...it gains even more magic with each viewing.  It will upstage people looking for a traditional, formulaic, Hollywood-style comedy because it is an experimental, non-narrative based film.  He not only gives tribute to his hero Stan Laurel (of Laurel and Hardy), who makes an appearance in this film, but in an inspired and subtle way, to many great early comedies and shorts, like Eliot Porter's &quot;Fun in a Bakery Shop.&quot;  Here we also glimpse Lewis' great humanitarian and political side.  He plays a big-hearted, bumbling bell boy who gets treated like dirt but, with crazy devotion, tries to shine in every menial task he's asked to perform.  In a light-handed and funny way, he shows the unfair treatment and tedium that working-class people endure.  He mocks Hollywood's celebrity worship.  By playing a mute, he not only brings out the best and most outlandish of his physical comedy, but he also shows the unbowing spirit of the voiceless.  He weaves all these issues in so subtly and with so much joy that you hardly notice that he is making a statement.  Lewis' comedy and acting is brilliant,  and you'll be dazzled by all the inventive, wacky ways he brings out magic and laughs inside the hotel lobby.  &quot;The Bell Boy&quot; has the force and sweep of Disney's &quot;Fantasia 2000.&quot; A total gem of a movie!
 | product/productId: 0783227973 | review/userId: A1HS9F7J51E9CB | review/summary: Really Fine! | review/text: &quot;Primary Colors&quot; is a genuinely hard-luck movie.  Distributed when the real-life giant scandals of the Clinton presidency were at their height, customers were not in a mood for a cutting edge comedy on quasi-fictional smaller scandals concerning the same players. It's a shame! The movie has a superb cast, deft timing, packs a wallop, and teases the audience into some thoughtful moments.<p>John Travolta shines as the exuberant, larger-than-life, shrewd and sentimental presidential candidate, Jack Stanton.  He is a man with over-sized appetites whether it is chitlins or chicks, and rallies or righteousness.  Emma Thompson is properly steely in her resolve, but shows her aching vulnerability to Jack's massive infidelity. Billy Bob Thornton was made for the role a down-home vulgar cracker sidekick.  He can cry over his mama one minute and be ruthlessly savage the next.  Then there is Kathy Bates. I think it is an axiom of show biz to never co-star with a kid or a dog because they will upstage you every time.  To kids and dogs, add Kathy Bates.  When she blows into the movie as a wisecracking, politically savvy and highly neurotic idealist; everything else fades into the background.<p>This is one of the great movies of the decade.  Everything about it is first class from the brilliant direction of Mike Nichols ably assisted by his old sidekick Elaine Mayes to the carefully placed cameo roles of Larry Hagman and Rob Reiner.  Add this one to your DVD library.<br />-sweetmolly-

 | product/productId: 6302468140 | review/userId: A34IBXM7E8CPWE | review/summary: Above Average Creature Feature | review/text: If you are a fan of Godzilla or Gamera or any "kaiju"/giant monster movies, you have to add "Rodan" to your DVD collection. This is a fantastic little movie, with a pretty original story, and top notch special effects.<br /><br />The basic premise of "Rodan" is that a mining operation in Japan busts through a wall flooding the lowest tunnels of the mine. Two men are sent in to investigate, one of them turns up horribly mutilated and it's presumed he was murdered by the  second man who has gone missing. More death and destruction follow, and it's learned that the culprit is actually a group of giant caterpillars. While trying to stop the caterpillar menace, a new force is unleased....two giant, prehistoric birds that destroys everything in their path.<br /><br />For most of the film the Rodans are portrayed as little more than high flying vapor trails. The final half hour is wall-to-wall Rodan vs. Army mayhem and lots of fun, but that doesn't mean the first hour is lacking. The giant bugs, known here as Meganulon more than carry the film. There are some pretty suspense-filled scenes as miners walk in waist deep water searching for the hungry critters. I actually preferred the first half of this film before Rodan even makes an appearance.<br /><br />This is a fun movie that seems to have been relatively forgotten. If you are only familiar with Rodan as a nemesis/ally to Godzilla, give the big bird a chance to win you over with his own story.

 | product/productId: 0790743132 | review/userId: A3BSS2M2DPPV4T | review/summary: VICHY MOROCCO, 1941... | review/text: As time goes by, no film equals the popularity of this indisputable classic.  In quintessential roles, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are former lovers reunited in wartorn Casablanca... Rick's place is a rendezvous for every crook and refugee in Casablanca: Bogey is the cynical cafe owner who lives by his own moral code and sticks his neck out for &quot;no one&quot;.  Bergman, as the beautiful wife of Resistance leader Paul Henried, finds herself torn between two lovers when she reenters Bogey's life...The film's GREAT success lies in the inimitable pairing of its two stars, a thoroughly romantic story line, terrific humour and numerous moments of genuine suspence.  Of course, that great ending helps, too!  Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.  Nearly stealing the picture is Claude Rains as a &quot;poor, corrupt officer&quot; who as a Nazi puppet soon discovers &quot;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.
 | product/productId: 0790750414 | review/userId: A223V8OGDVIR81 | review/summary: A funny movie with many hard to catch jokes! A WINNER! | review/text: This movie was very entertaining. The very first time I saw it, I wasn't paying attention and missed most of the jokes. But then at a party, I watched it and paid very close attention to it (I had nothing better to do) and found it awesome! Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors and he has not let me down. Him and  Matthew Perry were a great team. The attractive Amanda Peet added well to the movie. And another one of my favorite actors, Michael Clarke Duncan, did a extrodiany job as a conman. He is usually in serious roles but this proved he is a great all around actor. HE IS AWESOME!! So I suggest you see the movie more than once because the funnier jokes are the ones you'll miss.
 | product/productId: 6301750705 | review/userId: A2RRGL958OV626 | review/summary: Not Zorro, but good enough | review/text: Lovely Linda Stirling, fresh from her starring role in Republic's &quot;Tiger Woman&quot; serial, got to play another athletic female. As noted in other reviews, this serial has nothing to do with Zorro, except mentioning the name in the title and the similarity of outfits for the masked rider. It's a traditional western with a masked hero known as the Black Whip, who is fatally wounded (!) in the first chapter, limps back to his secret cave, and dies -- only to have his sister take over his mission, combating outlaws who are trying to run the territory and keep out statehood. The undercover operative hero is competently played by George Lewis, usually seen as a bad guy (although he was Zorro's sidekick in the future Republic serial, &quot;Ghost of Zorro,&quot; and Zorro's father in the Disney TV series). He and Linda Stirling make a terrific team. In the last scene of the first chapter, they save each other's lives about three times in a two-minute wagon chase sequence.
 | product/productId: 0967124808 | review/userId: A379XJ1F9KX63Q | review/summary: All Around Excellence!!!! | review/text: The content of this video has been used for about three full weeks since I purchased it.  My team consists of 9 & 10 year old players.  The video contains  34 drills and runs about 32-35 minutes long.  Having purchased two other baseball instructional videos, I find "The 59 Minute Baseball Practice" to be of great value and organization and by far the best of the three.  It is obvious that most youth baseball coaches do not spend a career planning practices so most of us tend to do the two hour batting  at each practice and feel we have accomplished a lot.  What this video does is combine fun drills with baseball skills.  It makes for a very refreshing and creative item that youth coaches of players 7-13 (maybe 14) should receive the most benefit. If your team is like mine, they won't love every drill but the ones they do like, they will ask you about the second they get to practice.<br />A lot of the actual organization is excellent and safety seems to be properly taken into account.  The real brilliance of this video is it will open your own mind to be creative and invent your own drills from the ones shown. In fact, the narrator recommends to be creative and change the drills to fit your team's "likes and skill level". I have done this and was quite surprised at the positive feedback from my players.  This is a great item to purchase.  Buy it and get the remote ready while viewing.  Then write down 4-5 drills you want to use and go out with your team and do them and you'll be amazed at the happy faces you see.  Oh yea, a lot of the drills can be done in the backyard for a parent and child.  Will this video teach your team how to turn the perfect 6-4-3 double play?  Probably not. But it will give you exactly what the description says: a  very good alternate to the traditional boring practice with lots of great stuff.

 | product/productId: 0783225857 | review/userId: A3IKBHODOTYYHM | review/summary: A film that lives up to the book, and so much more | review/text: To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.<br /><br />The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern "inhospitality". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent "craziness", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.<br /><br />This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own.
 | product/productId: 0790732238 | review/userId: A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP | review/summary: Awesome movie,But Segal's Best ?....Not Really | review/text: If you ask any non Seagal fan..Or even some Die Hard Seagal fans, they might tell you that Under Siege is his best movie. and according to Amazon " Seagal can consider himself lucky if he ever makes a better movie than this one" Seagal has never been an academy award wining actor, and I don't think he will ever be; but you have to give him credit for making some bone crushing good flicks (at least his early ones)<br /><br />Under Siege is thought to be Seagal's best due to its similarity to Die Hard. Even at one point it was given a slogan of "Die Hard on A Battleship" Under siege is one of Seagal's best films, but I as a Segal fan don't think it's #1. I give #1 probably to Out for Justice, Hard To Kill or Marked For Death. The reason why I don't regard this as numero uno is because it feels as if they were actually working up on Die hard a bit. Also Seagal's fights are a bit short and at times in the dark; And not to mention the last fight with Tommy Lee Jones, it's too short and the violence is censored. But other than that the movie is a top notch action extravaganza, the action is great and the story too.<br /><br />In the movie Seagal plays Casey Rayback...he is a cook for battleship USS Missouri. Rayback has to prepare a meal for a special surprise party for The Captain (Patrick O'Neal) but the surprise is the new arrivals, which seem like musicians and caterers but in fact are invaders that are planning to overtake the ship to steal its arsenal of nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles. The overtaking went as planned, the people on board are taken as hostage.But...they didn't plan on the cook. Aside from being a cook he is an Ex petty officer/Navy seal who has been given medals many times and is an expert in martial arts and his specialty is counter-terrorism...oh boy..The bad guys chose the wrong ship to overtake. The movie is filled with great lines, and some quirky humor. This is Seagal while he still was the champ. Worth owning, for sure.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5
 | product/productId: 1569385882 | review/userId: A2Y739CRM15WDL | review/summary: Excellent Boxed Set | review/text: One of the things I have enjoyed about the release of so many television series on DVD is the opportunity to own so many British television series that I have missed for one reason or another over the years.<p>As a reader of Caroline Graham's mysteries, I was pleased to find this series based on her characters.  Well written and well acted-- John Nettles as Inspector Barnaby is particularly appealing-- these stories peer under the peaceful facade of Midsomer County where a whole bunch of worms are writhing.<p>One thing I really enjoyed about this series is the lack of prettification of the actors.  Many of the main characters are unabashedly middle aged and their faces show it, yet they are still attractive and vibrant.  I think it was Charlotte Armstrong who once wrote how some signs of experience in the face was more interesting than &quot;the bald brow of youth.&quot;  This show illustrates this.<p>Don't buy this series for the DVD bonus extras though.  They hardly exist.

This movie had some hysterical moments where only Sellers could pull it off. It's dry british humor set against a 60's backdrop in L.A. with Sellers playing the bumbling guest who tries to mingle in a group of relative strangers with his awkwardness and lovable innocence. Did I mention that he's an actor from India trying to make it in Hollywood. His appearance and accent blurs the line of character and actor. You'll recognize a few famous faces among the guests at the "party". My favorite lines are "birdy num num" and "howdy par-de-ner".

Allow me to throw a few of my own unique ones into the pot.<br /><br />Collapse of Western Civilization: I don't think its been done better. The screenwriters set it up with excellent reality making it entirely credible.<br /><br />Use of visuals: One of the beautiful aspects of the film is that it uses visuals and music instead of dialogue to tell the story in many scenes. That results in 100% brillance. So often today films have to overkill the dialogue. This is done with taste and quality. Its a lesson to modern filmakers.<br /><br />Tension: The music score is perfect augmenting the feeling in the scene that accompanies it. The editing is also flawless.<br /><br />Story: As a person who understands human nature the story is entirely believable. Western civilization falls, all hell breaks loose it becomes kill or be killed leading to anarchy. Thus, the "sane" world becomes rapidly devoured up by chaos.<br /><br />Acting: No weak performances. All the characters flesh out wonderfully.<br /><br />Many would consider this not a "chick" flick. (I can't believe I typed that cliche) It is a deeply intense drama that brutally represents of what the world would be like if anarchy ruled. It might turn off some for that dark protrayal. For me personally, I view this as a post apocalypse "Gladiator." Gladiator had many of the excellent film and story traits this film has.<br /><br />Simply put - Probably the best example of the post apocalypse genre in terms of story, film making and editing. If you don't have it you are missing an excellent piece.

The interview was interesting to watch though I would have  liked the featurette on the making of the movie to have been longer and  more in depth.  It's a keeper.
 | product/productId: 6301008723 | review/userId: AYMZTWBG0V53W | review/summary: A terrific treatment indeed... | review/text: Hmmm, my oh my, "The Exorcist" film version is a strange one. First off, and it might be trivial at this point to mention it, the film version is very loosely based upon the novel itself. Friedkin's film is an agnostic treatment of this subject matter, not a truly belief-based interpretation. Even though the director put back in some of the missing "carpentry" (as Blatty refers to) in the "Version You've Never Seen", there are still a great deal of unexplained questions. This movie is not really about the occult all that much; it is more of a family-in-crisis kind of drama, with a lot of religious overtones tossed in. The novel includes scenes that make the threat of the supernatural more understandable to the reader (in the film, Chris has no book on occult lore laying around the house, the medium who showed up at her party warning her to take the "toy" away from Regan, the sub-plot about Karl's daughter, etc. have all been stripped away for this abbreviated film interpretation). In the film, things happen in far too abrupt fashion, with scenes of blasphemy mixed in with scenes of spiritual faith, none of which ever gels completely. Also, as one reviewer on here stated before, Blatty has not really done his best to tell a cohesive story. It appears that there is a battle between good and evil going on, but the old Jesuit priest's conflict with the demon is perhaps one of the most mis-understood pyschological Western-type motifs ever committed to celluloid (everybody keeps referring to the entity as "the Devil," or "Satan", not the real character shown in statue form in the movie). Friedkin's film is far more empathetic to the plight of Chris, and this is no doubt a strong feminist movie (despite poor Linda's abusive scenes) in the director's hands. Therefore, we end up with a movie that is entirely humanist, but no less fascinating (and superbly entertaining, in my opinion, at least). This is not a detective movie, either, despite the brilliant Lee J. Cobb's thankless role. Finally, as for this being a horror film, I ultimately have to disagree with this conclusion...there is nothing here that has the INTENTION to frighten viewers as much as it does to make a viewers THINK, and therefore it is more dramatic (I admit quite intense at times) than scary. One reason this film will stand the test of time (so to speak) and keep fascinating viewers today who might be new to it is simply for the reason that, unlike most of today's scare pictures, this one is about age old ideas concerning themes that we all have some steak in (life and death, c'mon) and a set of terrific performances from every actor involved, despite the thin storyline that they were given to work with, they really bring these performances home in a unique fashion (Miller is intensely good here, but so are Von Sydow, Burstyn, sweet Linda, etc.) Anyway, this movie also has some funny moments that I believe to be intentional (the phone ringing while Karras is listening to the tape comes to mind).<br />As for this BluRay presentation, one could not ask for better. Every extra that any sane person could wish for is here, and the picture and sound are superlative. Earth-shakingly good effects, sound design, etc. After "The Exorcist", I think the horror film underwent a dramatic revision in terms of the use of sound effects and music, as the old "jump out of your seat" music that informed you that a scene would be terrifying (like in "Psycho") would no longer be so obviously, or so routinely, used ever again. I was fortunate enough to see the 2000 extended cut at a local theater a couple of years back on Halloween night, and the experience of watching a good classic movie like this one is always more rewarding than watching these simplistic newer movies that we have nowadays. I enjoy the expanded cut more so because to me it is, in a sense, the most complete version (despite some silly effects shots that really shouldn't have been added). This movie should be a lesson to all of those who wish to make films...effects are always important, but the major special effects are always the actors and the script itself, not the visuals.

 | product/productId: 5553601894 | review/userId: A13TO1ZFAH9SVN | review/summary: I enjoyed it | review/text: Selling your soul to the devil has been a theme in a couple of moives. This modern tale of it isn't that bad and is actually pretty good thanks to smart writing, a great director, and good casting.<p>Elliot Richards(Fraser) is the love desperate nerd that everybody hates. He is to nice and gets annoyinig from the simple fact that he trys to hard. He has the hots for a woman at work Allison(O'Connor) who barely even knows he's there. He wants her desperately so he says to God he'd do almost anything for her. The next thing you know The Devil(Hurley) is there offering Elliot a chance to get Allison.<p>The deal is simple. Elliot will get the Devil his soul in exchange for seven wishes. Elliot is reluctant at first to the proposition but after some clever temptations by the devil he buckles in and says yes to her. The next thing you know he is making wishes and the devil is fulfilling them with some nasty and quite devilish tricks. Now Elliot must decide if this is really the path he wants to take and if these wishes are all that they are cracked up to be.<p>Brendan Fraser is good in this movie. This guys movies are usually hit or miss and this one is a hit. I don't like it as much as say the Mummy series or Blast from the Past, but this is a good movie. Fraser is fantastic when he acts out the wishes. He's so funny when he's the Colombian drug lord speaking his Spanish. He's great in the movie and you can tell he really had some fun making this movie.<p>Elizabeth Hurley is breath taking in the film. This is one of the most gorgeous and flawless woman in the world and in ways she carries this movie. She is very tempting and I like how they casted her as the devil instead of some sweet talking con artist man. She's so hot in the film and she's just awesome. If you like Elizabeth Hurley you have to go and watch this film.<p>Harold Ramis has given himself another good film. This guy is a clever writer and it shows in the film. The movie was also clever in the way that he includes all of Elliots co-wokers from the beginning of the film in the wishes. He's a smart director and really is underrated in the business. He needs to make more movies because most of the ones he's made are great.<p>Bedazzled is a good movie and it's easy to find cheap. If your looking for a good pop corn movie this one is it. It has a good moral ending that I don't think will offend anybody. Go see Bedazzled and be prepared for a devilish good time.

 | product/productId: 0790741431 | review/userId: A3DDPQ9342UNMY | review/summary: Bleak western has dysfunctional family fearing a black panther... | review/text: A disturbingly dysfunctional family is at the heart of TRACK OF THE CAT, which tries to impose symbolic significance on the threat of the creature that is being stalked by the two oldest brothers. But the tale, filmed in muted color with Mitchum's red jacket dominating the screen, tends to be a somber and talky character-driven tale exploring deeper meanings but never quite connecting with them.<br /><br />The performances are standard except for Mitchum who does a believable job as the loutish oldest brother in an underwritten role. TERESA WRIGHT, DIANA LYNN and TAB HUNTER do fairly standard work, under William A. Wellman's slow-paced direction.<br /><br />It's a stark and brooding story of an isolated farm family living in a remote area and haunted by the symbolic "cat" of the title. Photographed in muted WarnerColor with effective background music by Roy Webb, its somber wintry atmosphere is well captured in the opening scene but becomes tedious before the story reaches a midway point because a real connection with the troubled characters is never really made.<br /><br />All the cast members have done better work elsewhere. It's hard to believe how matronly and severe TERESA WRIGHT became for this role. She's almost unrecognizable as the spinsterish sister, only a few years beyond her delicate work as a leading lady in many films of the '40s. WILLIAM HOPPER is effective as Mitchum's outspoken brother.<br /><br />All the interiors are filmed in a style that seems more like a filmed play than a film. BEULAH BONDI as the embittered mother manages to give some gravitas to the story. ROBERT MITCHUM gives his usual sturdy and colorful performance as the oldest son hellbent on tracking a killer cat. TAB HUNTER as the weakest younger brother has less to work with and plays the majority of his scenes with nothing more than a solemn gaze.<br /><br />A fairly interesting, harsh, character-driven tale that should have been much more effective with better dialog and family dynamics.

It wasn't quite up to Bonnie and Clyde but it was close. It also wasn't historically accurate in all occassions but it was still a good movie. The acting was aslo very good. Warren Oates shines as Dillinger and there are many familiar faces like Harry Dean Stanton and others that fill out the cast nicely. This movie is very violent but so is the subject matter so it might not be for everybody but I recommend it.
 | product/productId: 0792838343 | review/userId: A2RH7ARWQSUVQV | review/summary: Last Bogey in Burbank | review/text: Magnificently acted tale of a tormented man and his child/woman victim.<br /><br />Brando/Paul's soliloquy to the body of his wife dead by suicide is memorable, disturbing and informative all at the same time.  He starts out by insulting her using the most degrading words possible.  He displays his confusion, hopelessness and abandonment and ends with an outpouring of his own unspecified...guilt.  There is a moment when we fear that Paul might attempt an act of necrophilia on the dead woman.<br /><br />In his 'relationship' with Jeanne we perhaps learn something of the nature of Paul's guilt.  He's a sado-masachist and, Jeanne, despite her beautiful body, is a child.  Therefore, there is a strong pedophilic component of the diseased relationship.  Jeanne reacts, not as an abused woman, but as an abused child.<br /><br />Paul forces the girl to drink the deepest dregs of sexual humiliation, depravity and degradation.  Sex is not for love but for hate....and the more hateful the better.  Jeanne, reacting as a child, comes back for more and more and the ending is predictable.  The very sick Paul is a sexual psychopath and Jeanne will die, either by her own hand, or by Paul's hand following or during an act of sexual perversion and torture.<br /><br />If there is any question about it, there is the last tango.  Jeanne tries to break free but, showing her conflict, performs an act of oral humiliation.  She runs but Paul pursues like a cat toying with a helpless mouse.  She runs, he runs.  She slows, he slows.  She flees up an elevator, he keeps pace on the stairs.  She escapes into her mother's apartment and Paul breaks in.<br /><br />Now all that is left is for the delicate, beautiful, completely confused Jeanne to die terribly.  But noooooo....<br /><br />After watching the film, and appreciating the fine acting, I searched for a redeeming feature of this excruciating and difficult film.  I think it's there but am not sure whether the writers, directors and producers of this film realized it.  For certain, none of the reviewers here--most of whom seem to have been dazed by Brando's fine acting and the girl, Jeanne's, perfect body--caught it.<br /><br />This is the intimate portrait of a sexual psychopath.  Had Paul survived and extracted the last iota of pleasure from Jeanne's degraded corpse, there would have been momentary relief before his next victim...<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels of Spanish Conquest of America--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'

 | product/productId: 0800113047 | review/userId: A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX | review/summary: Pure Capra | review/text: Please note I saw this movie on TV so I can't speak to the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />This movie is pure Capra from beginning to end. Lionel Barrymore is superb as the nominal patriarch of a bunch of eccentric free souls, who, long before the 60s and its "tune in, turn on, drop out," message, basically had the same idea back in 40s era Manhattan in this very funny movie. It's interesting that Barrymore plays the anti-capitalist here when he played the wealthy and greedy Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life, again with Jimmy Stewart. The residents of this looney bin pursue various hobbies including dancing, playing the xylophone, writing plays, making scary rubber masks, and producing spectacular fireworks in the basement--which are always going off--lending various pops, bangs, and whooshes to the already pretty zany ambience of the place.<br /><br />When the son of a stuffy but very wealthy Wall St. financier (played by Edward Arnold who is perfect in this role) falls for Barrymore's granddaughter, the stage is set for a confrontation between the two families and their contrasting lifestyles--money and status vs. being true to yourself and doing your own thing. But despite the father and mother's disapproval, love wins out in the end. I note some of the reviewers here didn't like the movie and preferred the stage play. Well, I didn't see the play and can only say this is just another fun, warming, positive, and enjoyable Capra movie. The world could use another Capra and his uplifting message the way the world is going these days.

Becky didn't deserve Newton.  She turned his marriage proposal down because she did not see the value in his creativity and vision.  We get a real sense of what Gwen is feeling the first time she sees the house. Imagine this: You are walking thru a brand new house that was custom designed by someone you know.  No one has ever lived in it, and the person it was offered to has turned it down. Gwen thought the house was so beautiful that she sat out side of the house and stared at it in amazement! Although she initially didn't want Newton around because of her con, we know that she could see the value of the man.  This is the focus of the story: not the house but the story of a woman recognizing the quailites of Newton.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies!

Unfortunately they completely missed the point of the original and made their own movie. Instead of wasting your time with that pick up the original. Sure the special effects are not as good as modern CG but they still have a certain cool factor. The acting can be a bit cheesy at times but hey at least you can have a good laugh at that. The story is what is so good about this movie and, sadly, is what the remake completely failed to recreate. It is still relevant today and should not need updating!

 | product/productId: 1574925954 | review/userId: A1BA72K4VK1UN1 | review/summary: A solid rendering -- full-screen version | review/text: For fantasy movie fans this one is a big winner. It's Merlin's story, told in retrospect by the old necromancer himself.<br /><br />The casting is near perfect, the scenery and sets are superb, the cinematography is terrific, and the story continuity is quite coherent, (the latter of which is a big problem in the subsequent "Merlin's Apprentice").<br /><br />Merlin is "all good" in a time and place where nefarious scoundrels in leadership abound. He doesn't always immediately seize upon the right answers to various dillemmas as they arise but he's always first devoted to the wellness of mankind, frequently advising his "masters" to cease on the power-monging thing.<br /><br />The evil witch, a nemesis of Merlin and of mankind in general, does rake on one a bit with her whispery-gravelly voice (she has a LOT of speaking parts throughout the film) but other than that, I thought that this was a fine movie. Clearly, fans of "The Lord of the Rings" films will find this movie to be of near-equal quality, albeit it's not nearly so complex as that fine trilogy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had purchased a full-screen version of this film and the wide-screen one would clearly have been the superior choice. So, I'll pass this copy on to the neighborhood kids and then grab the widescreen one soon. At 182 minutes in length, this is a great film for rainy Saturday afternoons.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

The Motion Picture was an excellent way to "reboot" the franchise.  The Wrath of Khan continued the success.  The movie is amazing because everything comes together just right.  During the writing of the movie, Harve Bennett and Jack B. Sowards proposed important ideas.  Bennett wanted to make a movie dealing with Khan while Sowards wanted to make a movie based on the Genesis Device, the death of Spock, and the introduction of Saavik.  In the end, these ideas were put together to make one amazing movie.  In this movie, we are exposed to excellent external and internal conflicts.<br /><br />If you have never seen a Star Trek movie, this is the movie to watch.

 | product/productId: 0767823990 | review/userId: A3ECALIAYPXLCF | review/summary: MEKAGOJI: good, BABY: bad | review/text: I particularly like this film. It was originally intended to be the last of the Heisei series, with an American version scheduled for pre-production. However, we all know what happened with that, so Toho decided to have Godzilla survive until the situation with the American producers could be resolved. Scientists uncover two prehistoric eggs on Adona Island in the Bering Sea, of which one hatches into Rodan, who is somewhat disapointingly portrayed. Rodan acts as a protectorate of the other unhatched egg, which is attracting Godzilla to Adona Island. When G arrives, he engages Rodan, who is trying to protect what he thinks is his brother. In the meanwhile, the scientists narrowly escape, with the egg in tow. Godzilla is victorious, and Rodan is left for dead. When the scienists arrive back in Japan, they begin studying what they believe is a pteradon egg, in conjuntion with G-Force and Miki Saegusa, the psychic from the previous three films. They are very suprised when the egg hatches a godzillasaurus, the creature from which Godzilla was mutated. It is named Baby, and looks kind of like a green rubber ducky with sharp teeth. They are also surprised when they realize that Godzilla has a psychic attraction to the egg and has followed them to Tokyo. Godzilla destroys half of the city before he is confronted by Mchagodzilla, a new weapon created by the UNGCC as a countermeasure against G. It was developed using analysis of 23rd century cybertronics from the remains of Mecha-King Ghidorah. The fight sequence is cool, and G wins as a reult of the all-to-familiar "malfunction" on the part of Mechagodzilla. As Godzilla coninues his search for the egg, the scientists uncover a "second brain" located at the base of Baby's spine, and deduce that Godzilla must have the same anatomy, therefore, that is how they will defeat him. They begin repairs on MechaG, making it battle-worthy by combining it with Garuda, the first, failed, attempt at a weapon against Godzilla. They plan on luring G away from Tokyo, using Baby as bait, to an uninhabited island called Baas Island, where they will destroy his second brain. Unfortunately for them, Baby is scared and sends, somehow, for Rodan, who has survived an been mutated as a result of it's contact with Godzilla. Rodan kidnaps Baby, and Mechagodzilla, Godzilla, and Rodan engage in a "fight to the death" for fate of Japan, and Baby. Anyhow, all this is wrapped around a gratuitous drama involving a pteradactyl-loving G-force researcher, Miki Saegusa, and Baby's adpoted mother, a student named Gojo. The SFX are sometimes excellent, sometimes horrible, but they come off averaging out at pretty good, for a Heisei offering. I think Mechagodzilla looks great, despite the questionable "diamond coating." It didn't work on the SX2, why would it work now? Godzilla lokks very strong and fierce, even though they coninued to use the high-pitched "Godzilla vs. Mothra" roar instead of the deep, frightening, "Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" roar. The Ifukube Akira score is superb, tying in elements of some of his best work of the series, including the "Destroy All Monsters" score. This film is far superior to both it's predeccessor, "Godzilla vs. Mothra", and it's successor, "Godzilla vs. Spacegodzilla," which is absolutely awful. Overall, a must-have for any true Godzilla fan. Very entertaining.
 | product/productId: 6300274187 | review/userId: A3M2WW0PO34B94 | review/summary: Great In Each and Every Way | review/text: Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) don't want another strict, unfriendly nanny. Their father (David Tomlinson), a banker, believes that they need discipline and strict guidance. Their mother (Glynnis Johns), a leader of the Women's Suffragette movement, seems to agree with the children, but can't really say so. The next morning, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) arrives and takes the job, based on an advertisement the children wrote. Soon, she is leading the children in song, displaying her magical spells and clearly enchanting the children in each and every way. She introduces the children to Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a street performer who seems to have some history with Mary and they are off on a magical journey.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins", released in 1964, represented a magical blend of live action and animation that, at the time, was technologically very advanced. Disney just released a 40th Anniversary DVD, complete with a second disc of interesting extras.<br /><br />Watching the film again, I was struck by how rudimentary the special effects seemed. Then, remembering that this film was made in 1964, these same special effects became charming and wholly fitting for the story. The story is told through the eyes of the Banks children, and the use of these special effects helps to put us in their shoes. The story is set in Victorian England and it seems completely realistic that children in this era would see toy soldier marching into a toy box (stop motion), jump into a chalk drawing (2D animation) and watch their nanny sing to a bird (animatronics). The outdated look of these effects serves the point of view of the story beautifully and adds to the charm of it. We actually get a feeling that we are looking at a picture book as we watch the film. I can't even imagine how slick and uninviting the same film would be if it were made today, with CGI special effects coming out of the woodwork.<br /><br />Yes, the film is very saccharin at times, but this helps to define the viewpoint of the children as well. The story is told through their eyes. The struggles of their mother to win `the vote', their father's troubles at the bank, life in England at the turn of the 20th Century, are not going to be delved into too deeply. The children don't know about these problems. If the film started dealing with the mother's attempts to lead the suffragette movement, for instance, the viewpoint and the story would become off-balance.<br /><br />One of the most delightful things about "Mary Poppins" is the musical score containing many classic songs.  I've seen this film, or parts of it, dozens of times over the years. I think that even if you have seen it only once or twice, you probably remember many of the songs. "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "Step In Time", "Spoonful of Sugar", "Jolly Holiday" and "Perfect Nanny" are all songs that I remember, and I can even sing a couple of lines for most. The true mark of a good Broadway musical is that you leave the theater humming the tunes. The same holds true for a musical film. All of the best musicals remain classics because we remember the songs. The Sherman Brothers created a great score of music and songs all of which served to enhance and supplement the story.<br /><br />Watching the DVD, the second disc contains a making of documentary, a musical reminiscence with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and the surviving Sherman brother, a new animated short with Julie Andrews taking her grandchildren into a new chalk painting where they meet "The Cat That Looked Like A King" and more. There is also a brief featurette showing how the live action photography of Van Dyke and Andrews walking along the path for the "Jolly Holiday" number and the live action photography of "Step in Time" was superimposed with animation. While watching the making of documentary, I learned an interesting fact. Disney wanted the film to look like a Broadway play. All of the sets were fabricated on sound stages, adding to the idealized look of the entire film. "Chimpanzoo", a deleted song is also included. Sung by Richard Sherman and illustrated by story boards for the deleted sequence, presumably, it would have been part of the "Jolly Holiday" number. It is probably better that it was left out of the film.<br /><br />There are a lot more features on the second disc, too many to list. As is the case with the best Disney DVDs, it appears that they have included everything they could get their hands on. This makes the DVD a must-have for film scholars and collectors. Essentially, the best Disney DVDs are encyclopedias on the making of the films. Filmmakers, enthusiasts and scholars have the opportunity to learn so much from these DVDs, even if a lot of the material is sugar-coated.<br /><br />This is Julie Andrews's first film. Before this, she appeared on Broadway and in a television version of "Cinderella". It is a truly remarkable, accomplished performance, amazing for someone acting in their first film. Andrews brings just the right blend of friendship, guidance and stern leadership to the role. Hand in hand as she enchants the children, she appears slightly annoyed at various points. And what is the relationship between her and Bert? These are questions left unanswered by the film, thankfully. If they were to remake this film, the filmmakers would probably feel it necessary to make her a former barmaid or tarted up boozer, make her back-story more explicit.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke was a more established star at the time. His television show was in full swing and he had previously appeared in the Broadway and film versions of "Bye Bye Birdie". It might seem strange that a rising star would take what is essentially a supporting role, but I think he made a wise choice. He brings an unabashed enthusiasm to the role which is also very fitting. The entire film is meant to be seen through the eyes of Jane and Michael. Naturally, they would see a character like Bert as the neatest guy in the world. Van Dyke created a role that he will always be remembered for.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" is a classic. Every spoon full of sugar helps the film remain a classic in each and every way.

However, I kept forgetting this was supposed to be about queen Victoria. Young Victoria was short, chunky and homely as a mud fence. She was also said to have had a beautiful voice and a lovely laugh. If you were to put her in today's nondescript clothing and plunk her into a shopping mall she would be indistinguishable from all the other shoppers. The actresses that portray her are always very pretty, slim, and tallish. Victoria was one of the most photographed and recognizable women of her time. It's like making a movie about Eleanor Roosevelt and casting Elizabeth Taylor in the lead. The three cardinal sins of hollywood are to be fat, short,and homely. It is thought such people could not possibly have passionate fascinating personalities and movie makers believe that the public will not accept a feminine romantic lead who has such unfortunate dimensions. As a result, they are OK with an old fat Victoria but can't stomach a young chubby Victoria.<br />Victoria and her times are a fascinating study. Movies about Victoria should concentrate more on the historical backgroud and the complexity of her personality. She had noble and maddingly neurotic traits. Royals were the rock stars of their day. People wanted to dress and do as they did. For example: When anesthesia was discovered in the early 1800s doctors were reluctant to give it to women in childbirth because, according to the Bible, God wanted them to suffer the pains of childbirth due to the sins of Eve. Victoria was having none of that and when offered said GIVE ME DRUGS. Her use of anesthesia during labor made it permissible for women to bypass the bible and avoid hours of painful labor.<br />I'm still waiting for that 8 part series on Victoria and her times that realy does justice to the topic. When it comes it will be a knock-out!!!

I am thrilled to finally throw out the last of my VHS tapes as it was only sticking around for my Pirates tape, but if you were expecting the rare uncut version with Ruth's Act I pirate scene and Mabel' Sorry Her Lot, you will be disappointed, as I was.  I really thought since they were finally putting this together they would make it worth their while and include the full version that is only available via CD with Estelle Parsons plaing Ruth.  I guess I'm just annoyed they haven't released the complete version but otherwise still a favorite :)

All four of these movies are wonderfully happy and joyous to watch, always leaving me feeling good.<br /><br />The quality of the production in each movie is beyond reproach, with attention to detail evident at every turn.  Beautiful lighting, top notch sound, and oh that gorgeous Technicolor image.... just stunning in every scene.  And the DVD transfers live up to those high values, giving us every bit of detail, color, and sound to be had.  A+ all the way around.<br /><br />In fact, it's obvious that the versions included in this set are simply the number 1 disc from the Special Editions of each movie.  When I hit "Stop" on the remote control, a screen appears that says "Disc 1". So, the only things you aren't getting here are the special features included on Disc 2 of each of those Special Editions.<br /><br />I love old movies, and and now, thanks to this collection, I've gotten hooked on these old musicals as well.<br /><br />My highest recommendation for the high quality transfers of these wonderful old movies, and the tremendous value in this fabulous set from TCM!
 | product/productId: 0764004468 | review/userId: A2VG8F8TL6AYDR | review/summary: A mess | review/text: Julie Hagerty's finest hour will always be her doggedly literal-minded stewardess in &quot;Airplane&quot; (&quot;He's in the hospital.&quot;  &quot;The hospital?  What is it?&quot;  &quot;It's a big place with lots of sick people.  But that's not important right now.&quot;)  This film, on the other hand, which slunk onto my TV screen late one night as if the national television service were rightly ashamed of it, is not going to generate any joyful grins, except perhaps from the Israeli Tourist Board.<p>The premise is confused to begin with.  Hagerty discovers her alarmingly smooth-haired husband in bed with another woman and promptly jets off to Paris.  But by a less than hilarious series of circumstances, she ends up in Israel with no money and no luggage.  She goes to work on a kibbutz (you'll sit stony-faced as she not very amusingly grapples with bunches of bananas.)  More interested in painting her nails than working for the good of the homeland, she earns the disrespect of her flatmate (Aviva Ger, delectable but with the perplexed intensity of someone more used to playing Hedda Gabler in the national theatre than acting in a &quot;gentle comedy&quot;.)  She meets various men, all of whom turn out dodgy.  Eventually she sort-of gets together with this nice guy (Amos Kollek).<p>Kollek has a pleasant onscreen manner, dry and hangdog, like an even more Jewish Woody Allen without the worry lines.  But the script is a rambling mess, a string of anecdotes with no forward movement, and the direction is more daytime-soap-quality than movie standard.  When not being merely baffling in its inconsequentiality, it's confused as to whether it's a farce or a movie about How Julie Got Her Groove Back.  There are lots of nice shots of lakes and Jerusalem and that's about it.  Surely Israel can make better movies than this.
 | product/productId: 0764005189 | review/userId: A1U80UXWCKZTEI | review/summary: A deeply flawed presentation | review/text: I loved FANTASTIC PLANET when I first saw it in 1973 and have long wished to see a video or DVD that presented the film in good condition.<br /><br />I must confess that this version looks excellent, but the DVD itself just bugs me beyond belief.  "English WITH english sub-titles"?  Why do you need english subtitles if you're watching it in english?  Whoever came up with this idea should be sent back to the house.  The subtitles are intrusive and interfere with the picture.  While there are happily long stretches of the film without dialog, it is still annoying in the extreme.<br /><br />Anchor Bay should seriously reconsider this goofy idea and rerelease this film on DVD so that the english version can be watched without the ridiculously redundant subtitles.

 | product/productId: 6300268233 | review/userId: A35YWA2V4QHOJ3 | review/summary: Beauty contest of the soul | review/text: Dudley Moore plays a fellow by the name of George Webber.  Webber is a wealthy, accomplished & respected musician who has a great many friends and admirers.  There is one problem.  He is in his 40s and begins to experience his mid-life crisis.  He is restless & bored with life.  Although settling in to middle age, he finds that he is still attracted to women in their 20s (a "problem" that I myself experience).<br /><br />By chance, he spies a beautiful young woman (played by Bo Derek) who is on her way to her wedding.  She is the most gorgeous creature he has ever seen and he immediately becomes obsessed with her.  This obsession leads to a great many mis-adventures that lead the viewer through the balance of the film.<br /><br />While it is not apparent on the surface, I would characterize 10 as a dark comedy.  It is somewhat morose to think about getting older and no longer being young & vibrant.  The creative ways in which the film differentiates Moore's character from the young lover of Bo Derek's persona are almost creepy.<br /><br />Aside from the tragic loss of youth, the film is also a commentary on the issue of people's personalities not matching their exterior appearance.  While she is beautiful, Bo Derek's character is found to be quit wanting on the personality side of the ledger.  She is shallow and superficial.  Insofar as being a worthwhile person, she can hardly compete with George's girlfriend (portrayed by Julie Andrews).<br /><br />Of all of Blake Edward's films, this one is probably in the top 5.  It is insightful into what troubles we human beings as we grapple with your mortality and the decline of our bodies.  On the upside, there is also some gratuitous nudity, although they could have shown a LOT more of Bo Derek.  If Amazon had a 10 star rating, I would give this one a 9!

The movie within a movie theme is taken to an ad nauseum degree in a hallucinogenic rollercoaster of gore  and killings.  There's a mad killer tearing eyeballs out of people  watching a movie (&quot;The Lost World&quot;) in a movie theater which in  turn is being watched by an audience watching that movie in a movie theater  which in turn we are watching (unfortunately at home and not in a movie  theater)--what a mind trip that would have been!...and it doesn't even end  there!  It's a  unique thriller which takes a theme from  &quot;Demons&quot;, but increases it ten-fold.  This is a stunning  widescreen 2.35:1 transfer....the old P&amp;S VHS release really destroyed  the whole design of the film....you need the entire panavison frame to get  the complete effect that this is a film about film.  Bizarre, gory,  hypnotic....but most of all clever....check this one out...and stay for the  end credits!

 | product/productId: 630026999X | review/userId: A18THV8EAQF069 | review/summary: A Blu-Ray injustice to Creepshow fans! | review/text: First of all, let me explain that the TWO-STAR rating I've given this, the Blu-Ray DVD version of Creepshow, is only for the DVD itself.  The movie, which is one of my all-time favorite horror flicks is definately a FIVE-STAR piece of movie-making!<br /><br />This Blu-Ray disc, as others have found, is a great disappointment. The video transfer is fair at best.  I did an A/B comparision between this disc and the regular DVD on two Blu-Ray players with an HD 32" television and I see very little difference.<br /><br />But what's worse, the only extra is the trailer. Now here's the real injustice to Creepshow fans:  There is an excellent 2 Disc DVD Special Edition available from the United Kingdom. The first Disc contains the full-length film. But unlike the American DVD release, there's an audio commentary throughout the feature with George Romero and master make-up artist Tom Savini. And in addition to the 2.0 stereo sound, there's also a 5.1 surround soundtrack! The second disc is filled with a multitude of extras! First, there's a 90 minute feature "Just Desserts--The Making of Creepshow." It's loaded with interviews with George Romero, Tom Savini, and many other cast and crew  members.  Also included are deleted scenes, alternate takes and bloopers. Next, there's behind-the-scenes footage personally filmed by Tom Savini. Finally, there's a stills gallery and of course the trailer.<br /><br />The entire package comes in a clear standard keep case which is contained in an outer cardboard slipcase! Now, if you didn't already realize, here's the bad news:  Since this is a European release, it is in the PAL television format, Region 2.  It is also very unlikely that any of these extras will ever be available here in the U.S. because Universal Home Video owns the rights to everything in the U.K. not Warner Brothers; actually the 90 minute featurette appears to have been assembled by Universal and is introduced as Universal Presents...  I doubt Warner Brothers will ever strike up a deal with Universal to bring these features to us fans in America; they missed their chance for this Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />If you have a region code free DVD player and a PAL to NTSC television converter, go to Amazon.uk and order this package. It's well worth it!!

As you learn that violence and murder was no big deal to these people, it was the only way people stayed in line.<p>Robert De Niro, plays Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway. who acts as mentor to Ray Liotta's, Henry Hill, guiding him through the cheap steals and hijacks that fund their way of life. Along with Joe Pesci's psychotic portrayal of Tommy and the ever-looming, Paulie, as the boss; you cannot help but like them.<p>There is no real honour in family of gangsters, it is all about money and once Henry goes behind his boss' back to partake in cocaine dealing with his Pittsburgh connections, it sets off a chain of events that coincide with the end of the gangster era.<p>Joe Pesci delivers a superb performance, which he deservedly won an Oscar for. His temper and natural violence detracts attention from his diminutive size, who can only be controlled by De Niro, in a quiet but effective character role. I believe that Liotta does a good job as the lead character, his voice-over helping define scenes and situations.<p>Scorsese is the real master behind the film, through his camera work and plotting to tell a story about a group of people he both detests and admires.

Branagh's Henry V! | review/text: After seeing Henry V, my son wrote the following review:<p>Long before the English were crazy for Harry Potter, they were crazy for another Harry - Harry the King or, more formally, Henry V. Although he died nearly six hundred years ago, Harry and his "band of brothers" live on in William Shakespeare's play, Henry V.<p>My advice? Get to know Shakespeare (and Harry!) before an English teacher bores you with lectures and expressionless recitations from a textbook. That's no way to meet the famous playwright and the once king of England.<p>Rather, "bestow yourself with speed" to the nearest computer and order Kenneth Branagh's version of Henry V. (You may already know Branagh from his turn as the charming fraud Gilderoy Lockhart in the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.) Forget the Laurence Olivier version, which may be the Henry V your granddad knew, but --- skip it. Unlike Branagh's epic, Olivier's battle scenes seem phony, all of the best lines have been cut or delivered unconvincingly, and we never really get to know Harry the King. But Branagh's movie focuses on the king - his growth from a prince who drinks too much and runs with petty thieves to a fearless leader whose men are outnumbered five to one when they take the field at Agincourt, the scene of a brutal battle for the crown of France.<p>The movie begins a little slowly with Henry's priests advising him what claims he has to the French throne. But by the time the troops depart for the French shores, and Harry exposes three unlikely traitors, the movie picks up the pace, moving swiftly from the exciting scene at Harfleur to the battlefield of Agincourt.<p>Shakespeare penned Henry V nearly four hundred years ago, but his characters reach across the centuries to teach us about leadership and war. Henry V shows us the hardship, pain, and suffering of war, but it also shows us how courageous one must be to fight at all: "We are but warriors for the working day. Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd with rainy marching in the painful field. But by the mass, our hearts are in the trim...."<p>Shakespeare's language isn't easy to understand right away, but trust me: It's not all "thees" and "thous." And the action in this movie rivals that of The Lord of the Rings. Sword fights! Betrayal! Galloping steeds! Boastful Frenchmen! Brave soldiers! Some goofy humor! There's even a princess.<p>"This story shall the good man teach his son."

Her defiant humor and cavalier attitude at the same point in time makes one admire her ability all the more.<p>Lush and exciting, yet ultimately unfulfilling.<p>I still highly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to see Li in a departure from many of her other films - and I would have to say I enjoyed it very much.<p>I think Yimou made the mistake of relying on decoration in this film far too much, thereby undermining the expressive force of his actors. A sense that much was contrived, and clumsiness abounds - certainly not up to par with his earlier, more subtle works.<p>A movie worth every cent just for the entertainment value - with the added attraction of one of the most talented actresses the world shall probably ever know - intersting and enjoyable.

 | product/productId: 6302034485 | review/userId: A62G4QX6XQVLP | review/summary: Nothing but joy | review/text: This was the boys' second feature film, and I feel it's one of their best.  It kind of begins like their 1927 short 'Duck Soup,' only in the short the boys are trying to evade service with the forest rangers, who need help in putting out a fire, and in PUYT they're trying to get out of serving in WWI.  However, they can't get away with this for very long, and eventually are pressed into duty.  The scenes in the trenches and at the barracks are pure classic L&H, one constant laugh-riot all of the way through, particularly when they're capturing all of the Germans without even realising what they're doing!<br /><br />During their time as soldiers, they become buddies with a friendly young fellow named Eddie, whose wife is divorcing him.  Sadly, Eddie doesn't make it home from the war, but out of friendship, the boys determine to find Eddie's baby (who is being raised by Eddie's less than likeable in-laws) and take care of her until they can locate Eddie's parents and turn the little girl over to her.  This is the story that takes up most of the movie.  The scenes with the cute little girl are just great, and really sweet, showing how genuine their affection for children really was.  To support the child and themselves, the boys run a lunch wagon.  However, the authorities find out about what's going on, and from then on out the three of them have to stay one step ahead of the people who are after them, the people who want them to turn Eddie's baby back to her maternal grandparents.  While they are constantly trying to elude the authorities, they are also trying in earnest to find the girl's paternal grandparents, Eddie's parents.  However, Eddie's last name was Smith, which means that they're going to more than just a few houses in the area!<br /><br />This would be one of my top picks to recommend to someone who only knows L&H through their shorts.  They might not be as well-known for their feature-length films, but that doesn't mean that their features are any less perfect and side-splitting than their shorter films.
 | product/productId: 1572525436 | review/userId: A3T46X7M3AUDAB | review/summary: The Green Ray of Heavenly grace | review/text: "Magical" is a terribly overused word -- but it fits this luminous film to perfection. Once again Eric Rohmer demonstrates why his work is so justly praised. He has the gift of taking the simplest plotline, one that shouldn't be able to sustain itself for more than a few minutes, and weaving subtle beauty & depth out of it. There's never any sense of padding, of being self-consciously "artistic" ... and yet everything unfolds with such natural & unaffected grace.<br /><br />In this story of Delphine's summer vacation, he presents us with a charming, quietly assertive young woman who knows what she wants, and refuses to settle for less. Not that she comes across as ambitious, or self-centered, or narcissistic! No, she has some deeper connection to the world around her -- not a connection of mastery or snobbery, but an awareness, a respect for both it & herself. And her refusal to accept something less than what she (and everyone else) deserves is rewarded, as the blessing of the titular Green Ray touches her at last.<br /><br />The only thing wrong here is the so-so quality of the DVD, which I see has been discontinued. I can only hope that it's released once more in a form that does it justice. Criterion, are you listening? But even the shakiness & wavering quality of the image on this disc can't diminish the wonder of the film. Most highly recommended!
 | product/productId: 6301136527 | review/userId: A1EZMV5DSWU8TU | review/summary: "Ugly one-horned mule!" - Blix from 'Legend' | review/text: The enchanting story of a lone unicorn searching for the meaning of her existence, and any others of her kind, but comes to find out that the others are being kept prisoner in the waves of the ocean by a tyrant who lives in a black castle on a cliff's edge overlooking the raging ocean that is their keep, enforced by an enormous demonic red bull, forcing them back into the waves upon any attempt at escape.<br /><br />An amusing singing butterfly circles around her in the beginning, singing many fanciful songs but providing clues here and there for her journey.<br /><br />  Unicorn: "Say my name then. If you know my name, tell it to me."<br />  The Butterfly: [quoting Romeo & Juliet] "Your name is a golden bell hung in my heart. I would break my body to pieces to call you once by your name...!"<br />  Unicorn: "Say it, if you know."<br />  The Butterfly: "Rumpelstiltskin! Gotcha!"<br /><br />During her quest, she meets "Mama Fortuna", a witch-hag with a tree stump for a hat, who is accompanied by an ogre-like henchman and a bumbling wanna'-be "magician" named "Schmendrick" {which I have come to call occultniks}.<br /><br />  Schmendrick: "I am Schmendrick the magician, last of the red hot swamis."<br /><br />Fortuna runs a travelling carnival sideshow which features a satyr, harpie, and a manticor, among other creatures of legend for the awe and gawkings of villagers. She feels she hits bank when she discovers and captures the unicorn for display, who warns her that the harpie will one day take her due, and can see through the spell placed upon these others who amount to nothing more than an old toothless lion and a monkey.<br /><br />  Mommy Fortuna: "The harpy's as real as you are, and just as immortal. And she was just as easy to catch, if you want to know."<br />  Unicorn: "Do not boast, old woman. You death sits in that cage, and she hears you."<br />  Mommy Fortuna: "Oh, she'll kill me one day or another. But she will remember forever that I caught her, and I held her prisoner. So there's my immortality, eh?"<br />  Unicorn: "Let me go. And let her go to. I cannot bear to see her caged. We are two sides of the same magic... The harpy and me, we are not for you."<br /><br />Schmendrick decides to help the unicorn and eventually accompanies her in her escape and quest to the dark castle. A country wench 'Molly Grue' joins them, regretful that the unicorn did not visit her when she was "new", yet becomes her servant nonetheless.<br /><br />  Molly: "Where were you twenty years ago? Ten years ago? Where were you when I was new? When I was one of those innocent young maidens you always come to? How dare you! How dare you come to me now, when I am this!"<br /><br />At The Castle, the unicorn is transformed into 'Lady Amalthea' {Mia Farrow} and meets King Haggard {Christopher Lee}, Prince Lir {Jeff Bridges}, along with a talking pirate cat and an obnoxious though entertaining skeleton with a penchant for wine. Amalthea falls in love with Prince Lir, which keeps her from changing back into the unicorn for awhile. As the mortal Lady Amalthea, the transformed unicorn feels her magic diminishing, the longer she remains a woman, and can feel her new body "dying all around her".<br /><br />The group gather the clues and finally reach the other unicorns where both Schmendrick and Prince Lir battle The Red Bull.<br /><br />  The Skull: "To get to the Red Bull's chamber, you must go through time. A clock isn't time; it's only gears and springs. Pay it no mind."<br />  The Cat: "When the wine drinks itself, when the skull speaks, when the clock strikes the right time, only then will you find the funnel that leads to the Red Bull. There be a trick to it, of course."<br /><br />The Last Unicorn features an "all-star" cast, and the folkish music of 'America', which actually works quite well here.<br /><br />Overall, it seems the Last Unicorn is a "coming of age" tale, the journey of a girl into womanhood until finally finding her purpose in life.<br /><br />  Unicorn: [now a woman] "I am afraid of this mortal body... more afraid than I was of the Red Bull."<br />  Unicorn: "Once, I can't remember, I was long ago, someone strange. I was innocent and wise, and full of pain. Now that I'm a woman, everything has changed. Once, when I was searching, somewhere out of reach, far away, in a place I could not find, or heart obey. Now that I'm a woman, everything is strange."
 | product/productId: 079074483X | review/userId: A27UWBI2R985CM | review/summary: Lonesome polecats. | review/text: A fairly low-budget musical from MGM, "Seven Brides" is, above all, a dancing film. The barn-raising scene alone is worth the price, with the brothers performing Michael Kidd's athletic choreography brilliantly, albeit in pastel shirts that were probably never really seen in the Oregon wilderness. The musical score is basically good, although it will never give Rodgers and Hammerstein a run for their money.<br /><br />Another highlight is the 'Lonesome Polecats' number, in which the brothers sing of their "loneliness" out there in the snowy forest, whilst chopping wood and holding firm axes. The symbolism is subtle, and certainly does not threaten the film's family-friendly tone. Also notable is the "Sobbin' Women" number, with Howard Keel in fine voice.<br /><br />Indeed, Keel is outstanding in his role as the eldest brother, full of swagger and arrogance, while Russ Tamblyn and Tommy Rall stand out in their roles as two of the younger brothers, dancing up a storm and clearly having fun. Jane Powell shines in the rather thankless role of Keel's bride, her lovely soprano voice often better than the actual songs she is singing.<br /><br />Also be on the lookout for a young Julie Newmar as one of the future "brides".<br /><br />DVD transfer is good, considering the source (Ansco color is certainly not Technicolor), and the DVD includes the rarely-seen alternate filming in VistaVision, as well as some cast interviews.<br /><br />A great addition to any collection of classic movie musicals.
 | product/productId: 0767847105 | review/userId: A39IBJB2PBVC7I | review/summary: Mama Said There'd Be Gays Like This | review/text: Pedro Almodovar's masterpiece, All About My Mother, avoids wide, well-lit boulevards, choosing instead to shed light on its large, complex subject by trolling life's darkest and most unsettling alleys.  (Instead of June Cleaver you get Hermana Rosa, a knocked-up nun.)  The film is brilliantly crafted, visually spellbinding, full of lovely literary and film allusions, funny, poignant, and heartbreakingly real.  The irony here is that, by gleefully thrashing stereotypes and searching where nobody else would, Almodovar offers a portrait of motherhood so authentic it can even withstand crossing gender barriers.<br /><br />Trouble begins early.  The first of many mothers in the movie, Manuela - played with fierce conviction by the lovely Cecilia Roth - has an inappropriately close relationship with her teenage son Estaban.  Their life together is complete, in its way, though fatherless.  Estaban's death sets Manuela on a pilgrimage of sorts, from Madrid to Barcelona, to tell the boy's father what's happened.  But this connection is only one of many, to people from her past, to a theater troupe, to another Estaban not yet born.  Her fatalism, her sense of self-sacrifice, and her amazing endurance are uniquely maternal - one senses that Manuela would do whatever was required to discharge her obligations.<br /><br />Manuela's time in Barcelona is an orgy or people, mothers of all descriptions.  Almodovar mocks that most famous of all mothers, the Madonna, by casting Penelope Cruz as Hermana Rosa, a beautifully innocent, simple-minded nun dying of HIV-AIDS.  Not exactly exemplary.  Hermana's mom won't be getting many cards on Mother's Day either; she's too busy forging Cezannes to spend time with her daughter.  Likewise, the theater troupe is not exactly overrun with familiar mom types.  Marisa Peredes is amazing as Huma Rojo, the lesbian leading lady with a Bette Davis fixation.  She's smitten with co-star Nina, a narcissistic nymphet junkie.<br /><br />Fortunately, Manuela's old friend Agrado possesses many of the traditional maternal virtues; caring, compassion, and concern for the welfare of others.  Problem is, Agrado is not a mother at all but a transgender male prostitute well on the way into womanhood.  Oddly enough, this also describes Estaban's father, Lola.  (Lola is clearly played by a man but the part of Agrado is inhabited by Antonia San Juan, a woman playing a man who is "playing at" being a woman - a dazzling performance.)<br /><br />If all this sounds bizarre and confusing, it should.  But Almodovar loves these characters and never uses them as stereotypes or punchlines.  There's more to motherhood than bringing life into the world, and All About My Mother shows that what we think of as motherhood, that is, being the heart and soul of a family, comes in more forms than we are brave enough to imagine.  You will not forget this movie.
 | product/productId: 6300181405 | review/userId: A3LDUEO8JG37RP | review/summary: Eastwood's Time Capsule | review/text: First I'll tell that this is a very entertaining movie. Great plot, acting, suspense and so on. Jessica Walter's performance deserved an oscar. I still see her in my sleep - waving that knife around - just like she looks on the video jacket cover.<p>The reason I really enjoy this movie is it just wreaks of 1971. I just love looking at the hair, the clothes, the decore. Not to mention the music. From Roberta Flack's &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; to the cool jazz of the Monterey Jazz Festival. This film totally reflects what was up in Carmel, California in the early 70's. This film was very much overshadowed by another Eastwood film that also came out in 1971 called Dirty Harry. Maybe you've heard of it. In Dirty Harry, during the opening bank robbery scene, Clint walks in front of a movie theatre playing, you guessed it, &quot;Play Misty For Me.&quot;<p>This is a somewhat forgotten movie these days, so if your sitting home on some rainy Saturday night, just do me a favor and Play Misty For Me.
 | product/productId: 0783235488 | review/userId: A2B7BUH8834Y6M | review/summary: Awesome special effects | review/text: For pure entertainment value and eye-candy alone, I really enjoyed this film. The acting was good, even though the plot was full of holes and the script had some extremely cheesy lines. It was good to see Phil Hartman on screen, but his talent was wasted in this flick - his character was a minor one and he didn't get many lines.<p>The premise: a military defense contractor expands its boundaries by buying up a successful toy company, hoping to put surplus chips to use by remarketing them as toys.<p>Two races of action figures - soldiers (human) and Gorgonites (totally dissimilar to each other, from the planet Gorgon, both are programmed to be mortal enemies. The soldiers are programmed to win, the Gorgonites are programmed to either hide or lose.<p>Apparently no testing takes place before they hit the shelves and the soldiers are ruthless, ripping the Gorgonites limb from limb.<p>They decide that children who play with Gorgonites must also be destroyed, as they are perceived as being collaborators with the enemy. Needless to say, this is entertainmen for grownups, not for little ones.<p>The chips that are used in them give them artificial intelligence - the ability to  learn and to create new weapons using anything they find. Almost like &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; along with the passion and emotion.<p>Archer, protector of the Gorgonites, is the true heartwarming character of the film. He is homesick for Gorgon, and even though the planet only exists in the mind of the toymakers that marketed him, he longs to be home.<p>Alan, a boy trying to re-earn the trust from his parents, has a hard time proving that toys are the ones wreaking havoc until they are caught in the act.<p>In the end, it becomes a literal fight to the death between the small soldiers and the children and their parents.<p>The film falls short in that it doesn't know if it's a farce, a parody, a comedy, an action flick or a drama. They try to put in way too much, so most of it falls flat.<p>The scenes with the attacking Barbies is more creepy like &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; than it is funny, even though you get the jokes in what are supposed to be comic relief moments.<p>Still, this is well worth watching for the animitronics and for sci fi concepts.

 | product/productId: 6301861019 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: The Tree of Wooden Clogs | review/text: One of Olmi's greatest accomplishments, "Clogs" is a sensitive, verit&eacute;-style drama that unfolds at a leisurely pace, with indelible, naturalistic performances by the entire cast of nonprofessional actors. Olmi based the film on stories his grandmother recalled about growing up in Lombardy, and the subtle power of this film comes from the calm, unforced manner in which he portrays lives of drudgery and sacrifice. Some scenes stick in the mind, like an old-timer regaling villagers with a ghost story, or a honeymoon trip to Milan on an old barge. Give "The Tree of Wooden Clogs" time to blossom, and you'll reap the rewards.
 | product/productId: 1556587864 | review/userId: ABN5K7K1TM1QA | review/summary: Near the apex of the sex/slasher genre | review/text: We might call this trash, but if we do we'd have to call it very clever trash, the sort of trash one might find dumpster-diving in Beverly Hills.<p>It stars Michael Douglas (who, by the way, has eclipsed the Hollywood power, if not the screen presence, of his dad, Kurt Douglas) and Sharon Stone who, as usual, finds herself in a part that requires that she take off her clothes and spout hard-edged one-liners: she does both with a certain delight that makes us think she is having a good time.<p>He's a San Francisco homicide cop named Nick Curran with some questionable shootings hanging over his head, hence his nickname, "Shooter."  She's a rich best-selling trash novelist named Catherine Tramell (pen name Catherine Wolfe) who likes kinky sex and other deviancies.  It seems that her latest boyfriend (depicted in a blood-splattered opening scene) abruptly, shall we say, met his maker while in the arms of Venus, something predicted in Catherine's latest opus.  We are made to believe that she could very well have been that Venus, although of course keeping us in the dark is part of the seduction.<p>Jeanne Tripplehorn plays Beth Garner, police Internal Affairs shrink who just happens to be Nick's latest main squeeze.  It seems that Catherine and Beth had a one-time intimate liaison while undergrads at UC Berkeley.  We are led to believe that she too might have done the killings.<p>So Nick has a choice, whom to believe about who's responsible for all the dead bodies, the blonde Catherine or the brunette Beth?  Both seem a little wacko/sexy.  He tries them both out, and we see a lot of skin and hear a lot of fast breathing, and are kept on the edge of our whoopee cushions until the very end--and after, actually, as though the purveyors were already counting on the sequel.  I am reminded of a lyric from Elvis Costello's "Everyday I write the book": "Even in a world where everyone was equal/I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel."<p>In other words, what this film is about is money--money for the producers, director, actors, crew, etc.  It's an extreme sexploitation thriller diabolically done with absurd plot twists and plenty of dead bodies and some diverting chase scenes (did I mention sex?); indeed I suspect that Basic Instinct will be recognized by future film historians as one of the primo examples of the sex/slasher genre, that is, as soft porn with a sick edge.<p>But wait, why did I watch this?  Uh...Sharon Stone amuses me like a comedic actress, but she ain't exactly funny, is she?<p>Also it's interesting to notice that in these late eighties/early nineties sexploitation flicks it's the women who are the aggressors (I'm thinking also of Single White Female from the same year) while the men play a little tagalong.  Michael Douglas is particularly adept at playing the sort of male who seems natural being dominated by Sharon Stone.<p>Bottom line: mass mind trash, but worth seeing for its ability to define the Hollywood mentality circa 1992.
 | product/productId: 0783244517 | review/userId: AFPI330XSM8CH | review/summary: An insult to all intelligent people | review/text: This is the stupidest movie I have ever seen(or even thought of). As other reviewers said, the only bright side of this movie is that it has Denzel Washington(Lincoln Rhyme) in it. Regardless of the the performances, the  plot is very insane. If you are a guy with a brain you'll be finally find  yourself that you've been on the bad guys side alone the movie. It's an  insult to love and intelligence.<p>  Angelina Jolie stars as an officer,  Amelia Dinaghy, who works with kids. She got in the story since she  discovered a dead body buried near the railroad tracks. She took all the  photographed all the evidence very smartly and rightly. Rhyme's(Denzel  Washington) impressed with her doings and since he is crippled(because of  the accident in the beginning of the movie) he decides to abandand all his  old buddy coworders and forced Amelia to asist him on this case. They work  as a good pair, Rhyme gives commands and Amelia finishes them. Although  they work very hard but still the killer has his victims lined up. The cops  can't stop the killer, they can only follow the evidences which are  intentionally left by the killer. Finally there is only about 15 mins left  in the movie and the good guys still don't have any clue to capture the  killer so the director decided to let the killer turn himself in but not  tragically but stupidly.<p>  After the movie I really felt the killer was  the only smart one and the cops plus all the other officials including  Rhyme and Amelia were all pethetic. The crime was solved not by those who  tried to solve it but by the criminals themselves(because they suddenly  became insane as the director told them to).
 | product/productId: 079073320X | review/userId: A7KC2Y7KU4D46 | review/summary: My thoughts | review/text: I liked the movie overall.  The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect.  I think this movie is more "about" religion vs science, than anything else.  Even extra-terrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second.<br /><br />Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character (Dr. Ellie Arroway), who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself.  Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did -- if it wasn't for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information.<br /><br />I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world.  I'm not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it's author; not about me.<br /><br />This movie has a strong undertone -- A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director:  This undertone is all about the battle between (1) sound scientific reasoning and logic (and 2) the single-minded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves.<br /><br />The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason.  I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie (little spoiler):<br /><br />~~~~<br />Palmer Joss: Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody. And I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in God. Someone who honestly thinks the other ninety five percent of us suffer from some form of mass delusion.<br />Ellie Arroway: I told the truth up there. And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.<br />~~~~<br /><br />Who is right or wrong?  I guess it depends on your own worldview.  When I was younger (years ago), I remember watching this movie and definitely agreeing with one of them; and now that I'm older I re-watched this same movie agree with the opposing character.  I liked the movie equally well when each viewing (separated by years of course), since the movie does a pretty good job of raising both sides arguments without sounding like it's definitively rooting for either.<br /><br />****** Now, this next part has a bit of a spoiler so don't read it if you don't want to ruin the movie ******<br /><br />In the end, the movie portrays a sense of balance -- that neither side is necessarily 100% right or 100% wrong when (1) the main religious figure (Palmer Joss), does in fact exhibit the redeeming quality of being open to the possibility that Ellie Arroway is telling the truth, and (2) the main secular figure (Ellie Arroway) ironically shows "faith" in that she truly believes (despite no empirical evidence) that her personal experiences were real and not a delusion; and she also bequests her opponents to have faith in her as well.<br /><br />Finally, there is just one big plot hole in my mind (also a spoiler):<br /><br />If nobody believed her, then why didn't someone else just go in the machine again and verify it?  Perhaps not using a WIRELESS camera this time...
 | product/productId: 6301969294 | review/userId: A25QNOP1660MTY | review/summary: Good but frenzied | review/text: You can definitely tell that the screenplay was done by Ayn Rand.  She made sure the director followed her theme exactly which stifled the feel of the movie and the directors attempts of making the characters a little more human.  Most if not all the characters dialogue felt like they were delivering a speech and in such a frenzied pace.  It just didn't feel people would talk like that in real life.  It's nice to see a film in black and white which has been shot so well.  The lighting and shadows are used to good affect, but the acting is too stilted and often the dialogue is obviously one sided in trying to express the author's point to excessiveness.  It's too bad since I admire Gary Cooper as an actor and felt that the movie might have been more effective in getting it's message out had it not been for the heavy hand of Miss Rand.

I'm a big Bette Davis fan, but the script left me wanting.  The whole time I was watching this, I kept making comparisons to Gone with the Wind- just a old campier version.  I'm not crazy about films that lay the troubles of the world at the feet of women-especially when the biggest crime she committed was to wear a red dress to a ball-which in a B&W film the whole red dress thing loses it's impact.  Just when the film was getting real interesting, the credits roll and I'm looking around to see whether there was a second disc missing.  That's it? You're kidding me.  Again, I LOOOOVE Bette Davis and this was a decent performance by both her a Henry Fonda (the Ashley character) but I just didn't care for this script like I'd hoped I would.

The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the plot (though rather loosely based on the history behind the real Mata Hari) had a lot of potential to be interesting and gripping, and it has four big names heading the bill.  Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro are two of my favorites, and though I haven't seen him in a huge amount of films yet, I've also really enjoyed Lewis Stone in the films I have seen him in.  The other big star, Lionel Barrymore, overacts as usual, though he does pull off the role well.  (Though I know he was talented in spite of his tendency to overact, it's beyond me why he was once considered a better actor than his brother John.)<br /><br />However, in spite of the big names, the promising storyline, and the gorgeous costumes and sets, the picture ultimately seems to fall rather flat.  Perhaps part of it could be attributed to how this is after all an early talkie, made in 1931; it would take a little bit longer yet for films to lose this stagy feeling, with almost nonstop chatter, and go back to having more freedom of motion and a balance between dialogue and scenes and moments that didn't rely so heavily on constant talk.  Many of these lines themselves weren't very dramatic or original, more like empty words used to fill the time.  Additionally, it just didn't seem to have a whole lot of dramatic tension or to be a very compelling interesting story till it was well more than halfway over.  There's also the problem of how Ramon is supposed to be portraying a Russian aviator.  Given his Mexican accent and Mexican appearance, it's not really convincing, though he is as beautiful as always, and does manage to convey his talent and bring depth and emotion to the role in spite of the oftentimes rather lame script.  And as in all of her other roles, Garbo also really shines.  She always managed to elevate films that would otherwise be outright clunkers to something interesting and at a higher level due to her subtlety and her electric presence, not to mention how beautiful she was even when she had to wear some pretty ridiculous outfits, as she does here (particularly her hats).  Basically (in my opinion at least), it's one of those films that one watches just to see the stars of because they made it interesting by their mere presence, whereas, had the leads been lesser-talented and less-captivating actors, one might not be all that inclined to want to watch it.
 | product/productId: 0790741067 | review/userId: A39IY0JU5JI69G | review/summary: Brilliant! | review/text: I loved this film when I saw it when it first came out.  The combination of Beatty and Christie, who were an item at the time, assured its success with a lot of people.  I wondered how I'd react to it now, so many years later.  I was happy that, although it didn't have the huge emotional impact that it did on my first viewing, I still enjoyed every moment and was again genuinely moved by it.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple.  The enjoyment, I think, for me, is largely visual.  The cinematography is gorgeous; there's something magical about shooting in the snow. (Remember that other spectacular Julie Christie film, Dr. Zhivago.) The two stars, of course, are in their prime and both beautiful to watch. They both inhabit their roles perfectly. The secondary characters are well defined and well played;<br />Altmann keeps them from falling into stock types.<br /><br />The music, from Leonard Cohen's smash first album, which came out prior to the film, perfectly enhances the magical, bittersweet, terribly sad but beautiful mood of the film.  The combination of Cohen's voice and the snow falling on the rough wooden buildings makes a kind of poetry not often seen in film.<br /><br />The High Priestess of Film Reviewing, Pauline Kael, has called this film a classic and I totally agree.

 | product/productId: 6301115538 | review/userId: A1DNAX5ZDDFPF2 | review/summary: Christmas Eve Tradition | review/text: Since my son was little, for the past 15 years, one of our main Christmas Eve traditons is to watch this movie together (which I had recorded from TV on VHS tape when he was a baby).  It is a beautiful re-creation, in words and visual imagery, of Dylan Thomas' book by the same name.  It is told from the point of view of a ten year old boy living on the Welsh coast in the early 1900's and is both humorous and touching.  My son is now 17, and he purchased this for my birthday.  It is my favorite of all the Christmas movies (and believe me, I have them all).  If you are a fan of Dylan Thomas' writing, you will not be dissapointed in this movie.

 | product/productId: 0792846311 | review/userId: A2HII4U9WQ0XUV | review/summary: Club Werewolf: No Pain, No Gain | review/text: If John Landis's "American Werewolf in London" is the funniest werewolf film, and Mike Wadleigh's "Wolfen" is the grimmest, then Joe Dante's twisted and gruesome "The Howling" is by far the sleaziest---and when I say sleazy, I mean that in the nicest possible way.<br /><br />"The Howling" is about investigative news anchorwoman Karen White(played competently though underwhelmingly by Dee Wallace-Stone), who in the course of investigating a notoriously brutal serial killer (she arranges to meet him in a screening booth of a porn shop, no less!), nearly becomes one of her erstwhile subject's 'works of art'.<br /><br />The traumatized White follows the advice of celebrity Dr. Wagner(veteran actor Patrick Macnee, who brings aplomb and class to the proceedings), and takes a sabbatical to the Good Doctor's health-spa resort and retreat in the Northern California mountains with her husband Bill (played by real-life husband Christopher Stone).<br /><br />This seems a welcome reprieve from White's high-pressure career, particularly as the most troubling element of our heroine's recollections concern what she thinks she saw of the Killer in the dim and flickering light of the porno booth: a bestial, glittery eyed, fanged creature.<br /><br />White takes Dr. Wagner's advice, packs herself and husband Bill off to "The Colony", and begins a roaringly good excursion with all the amenities of a high-end health spa, such as mud baths, morning exercises, yoga, meditation, and of course---flesh-eating and howling at the full moon.<br /><br />In the process, you're treated to some pretty raucous bloodletting, a densely creepy and deliciously terrifying atmosphere, exquisite werewolf effects by Rob Bottin (a Rick Baker disciple who later produced the goopey effects for "The Thing"), and gratuitous Kevin McCarthy and Slim Pickens.<br /><br />Beneath its sleazy and nihilistic modernist elements, Joe Dante's "The Howling" is stoutly traditional, drawing on all the elements from the classic werewolf films: fog-shrouded forests, lycanthropic legendry, a lady in peril, and the voracious appetite of the transformed Beast. Dante has conjured real terror here.<br /><br />As for the Special Edition, "The Howling" has never looked better, and the 5.1 remastered soundtrack will have you glancing over your shoulder for red eyes in the darkness. The DVD is stuffed with special features, including mercifully deleted scenes, amusing outtakes, bloopers, and interesting commentary from Dante, Wallace-Stone, and John Sayles. You get a Making Of documentary, a promotional featurette, and much more---certainly enough to sate the hungriest Wolf-in-Man's-Clothing.<br /><br />Some have criticized the characters in "The Howling" for behaving unrealistically: standing rooted to the spot while the werewolves transform, rather than running for the hills. But for me, that simply adds to Dante's dream-like film. In the realm of Dream, of course, when the Dark Deadly Thing comes calling, out of your closet or beneath your bed or through the window, you can't run.<br /><br />You remain frozen with terror, scream stifled in your throat, while the Thing's teeth tear free from bleeding, ulcerated lips, as talons distend from its twisted, bloated fingers, as tufts of hair writhe across its body and its spine grows long and twisted. You stand transfixed as it hunches, and begins its low, throaty, rumbling growl. While it prepares to spring...<br /><br />JSG
 | product/productId: 6301232291 | review/userId: A2OD45RK9UM55F | review/summary: A gem!! They don't make 'em like this anymore, alas. | review/text: I saw this movie years ago and remembered it with affection as an unfailing pick-me-up. I've just seen it for the 2nd time on telly and wrote my review. In my enthusiasm I neglected to avoid spoilers, so for those who haven't seen this screwball masterpiece, please see the movie first and then read my review! Regardless of what you may think of me, you will not be disappointed by this movie. I dare you not to be charmed.<p>One of Preston Sturges four or five masterpieces, and IMHO his most masterly piece. The beautiful Geraldine (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are your (seemingly) normal everyday working-class married couple in financial straits; Tom  needs some cash to develop his invention, a suspension-airport-tennis-racket, but this being 1942 and venture capital more difficult to raise in those days, Geraldine helps her husband and does the next sensible thing, deciding to divorce Tom, marry someone rich, and then invest in Tom's project. She hies herself to Palm Beach, touted to her by a helpful cab driver as the second most popular divorce resort next to Reno, &quot;but for my money Palm Beach is your best bet for this time of year, you got your beaches, you got your hotels.&quot; Tom for some reason disagrees with her plan, valuing their marriage over his fortune, and hies himself Palm Beach-ward to fend off his divorce-minded wife. But Gerry, who's left her husband without taking any money, sells herself to a band of gun-toting ale-drinking millionaires in exchange for a train passage, meets another multimillionaire by repeatedly grinding his pince-nez into his face with her foot (it's all right, he carries an inexhaustible supply of them) and becomes adopted by her smitten mutlimillionaire and his sister the Duchess or Princess Centimellia (oh, it's Princess, she divorced the Duke two husbands ago, or was it three?). This becomes complicated when Tom shows in Palm Beach and is taken up by the Princess in the guise of Gerry's brother, one Captain McGlue (&quot;Captain of what? The Boy Scouts?&quot; Tom shrieks. &quot;And why is my name McGLUE?!&quot;) and the multimillionaire, who goes by the nickname Snooty, attempts to befriend him, all the while imprecating Gerry's dastardly soon-to-be-ex-husband.<p>The plot, as you can see, is another of Sturge's marvelously convoluted structures, and is rife throughout with much of his trademark one-liners (&quot;It is the tragedy of this world that the men most in need of a beating are always enormous&quot;; &quot;Nothing is forever, dear. Except Roosevelt.&quot;) and dazzling design. What makes this concoction the creamiest of Sturge's crop are the wonderful performances; McCrea's stolidness doesn't trip him up as it did in the coda of &quot;Sullivan's Travels,&quot; and actually gives his Tom Jeffers a warm growly dog quality I find endearing. Mary Astor perfects her chatterbox heiress performance in this film. Rude Vallee is a revelation as the persnickety Snooty, abandoning his teenybopper-crooner fame to play the role of a parsimonious googolplexaire falling disastrously in love.<p>And Claudette Colbert, wow. Barbara Stanwyck may be more sexy in &quot;The Lady Eve,&quot; Veronica Lake more mysterious and stylish in &quot;Sullivan's Travels,&quot; but Claudette Colbert.... wow.<p>That said, I took a star off because of the sequences of the drunken millionaire's gun club and the black railroad servicemen. I know that the film was made in 1942 and one should make allowances, but the scene where the millionaires are shooting randomly around the train, forcing the black bartender to dance around their bullets made me wince. It was funny, but too sadistic for our sensitivities 50 years later. This goes too for the extended scene where the only joke is that the (black) train attendant continously pronounces &quot;yacht&quot; as &quot;yachit.&quot;<p>The film's abrupt happy ending was an out-of-left-field delight, and of course made me watch the beginning credit sequence again. I'm not altogether sure what happens there in the beginning, does anyone out there have any ideas?
 | product/productId: 6300271560 | review/userId: A3NSM4M3ELZFJX | review/summary: Really the Right Stuff.... | review/text: This is one of those movies that provides such valuable prospective, that even 25, 30 years after the movie was released, it still stands as one those movies you not only remember, you find you reference and watch over and over again. Read the book first, and then watch the movie, as certain references make more sense, but if you love learning about America's entry into the space race, and still more the Mercury Program, this is for you. It should be noted here that it is not just about the space program, but also about the Air Force, and Chuck Yeager, who broke multiple records while flying for the Air Force. There is SO much more I could say, but seeing the movie (and reading the book by Tom Wolfe) are the biggest things I could say. The cast is beyond anything you could create today: Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Barbara Hershey, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Shepard, Lance Henriksen, I could go on. Watch it, but plan on buying it. Enjoy!!

 | product/productId: 0767842693 | review/userId: A2NIALLM48GRVR | review/summary: You Can Smell The Dry Dusty Texas Air | review/text: The Last Picture Show examines life in the small rural town of Anarene, Texas circa 1951. With such meticulous attention to detail, you would almost swear you can smell the dry dusty air, as tumble-weed blows down Main Street and Tony Bennett sings &quot;Your Cold Cold Heart&quot; on the juke box. With the oil boom behind them, Anarene clings to life until finally even their beloved movie house flickers for the last time. Appropriately enough, it's Howard Hawk's &quot;Red River&quot; that marks the end of the line as the lights go up and the doors shut for good.<p>Peter Bogdanovich's brilliant direction earned him an Oscar nomination and he should have won it. Working with a cast of virtual new-commers, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybil Shepred and Randy Quaide, Bogdanovich catches lightening in a jar and creates such in-depth character studies you truly feel like these are people you grew up with. <p>So turn out the lights set up the projector and let this one roll one last time. Thank you Peter Bogdanovich for one hell of a movie!
 | product/productId: 0767802489 | review/userId: A2HKYKBWL55WCX | review/summary: Better than you remember | review/text: When I tried to watch Das Boot many-many years ago, it took way too long to get going and the only way for an English speaker to enjoy it was with subtitles. So I could never get passed the first 20 minutes. This DIRECTOR'S CUT with English dubbing is really great. I love WWII history and this moving has the real feel of the period. It highlights the disappointment of lack of support, and the difficulties of tight conditions on a sub with a bunch of young men (that could be German or Allies: all of these WWII boys went through the same miseries). The depth-charge scenes are cringing. And what an ending. One of those movies that you keep thinking about. So very glad I decided to give it another try.
 | product/productId: 6300181723 | review/userId: A1DC1O4VX6AHPP | review/summary: excellent movie, subpar DVD | review/text: I saw this movie on television several times on a cable movie network, always presented in widescreen format.  It's a terrific movie with solid performances and many wonderful character actors.  It has a mature pace, meaning slower than one would expect an action film, but done deliberately to build tension and heighten anxiety.<br /><br />When I saw this had been released on DVD, I cheered out loud and snapped up a copy, only to be extremely disappointed to find that it is pan and scan. I should have checked the box first, but I never in my wildest dreams would have expected this film to be released in anything other than widescreen.<br /><br />Pan and scan is a problem because you are missing important chunks of the film.  In one scene, a bad guy is seen laying defeated in the background; in the pan and scan, you can't see him clearly, and the impact of that shot is completely ruined.  You might even miss the bad guy in the background, meaning you wouldn't even understand the ending.  There is another scene in a farm pasture with John Vernon that looks downright silly cropped to the 1.33:1 ratio.  This particular pan and scan print seems to be a network television transfer, and since this was shown in widescreen on cable television in the 1990s, I am at a complete loss as to why Universal screwed up so badly and sold us this print instead of the good one.<br /><br />It's a small film that very few people know about, so I am not holding my breath that Universal will correct this.

Smart, sexy and filled with twists and dark humor.  If you liked Pritzi's Honor, you'll love this one.  One of the first feature films  w/Terri Hatcher and Brian Brown is wonderful as a lawyer who tries to  commit the &quot;perfect crime.&quot;  The crime isn't, but the movie is.

 | product/productId: 0792840917 | review/userId: A3MLO4GAD2O9DL | review/summary: Not a typical political thriller | review/text: This is a tough film to review because on one hand it doesn't take a linear approach to plot/storytelling, which means that the viewer has to fit a lot of the pieces together. But the thing is, there are different approaches to making a film in which the viewer has to fit pieces together.<br /><br />For example, in "Fear X", with John Turturro, the method used in which the pieces have to be fit together is an intriguing one because, principally, we are given some extremely interesting characters who pull us into the story and make us WANT to put the pieces together. The difference between "Fear X" and "Defense of the Realm" is instructive. In the latter, the primary focus in NOT on the characters but instead on the plot machinations that beg the viewer to fill in the gaps. This plot-driven approach--with basically flat characters--does very little to really attract the viewer enough to want to put the pieces together.<br /><br />Instead, we are taken from point A to point B, almost willy-nilly, with the filmmakers (writer and director) expecting us to do what has to be done to make sense of the film without providing characters we really care about. This makes the filmgoing experience a relatively dreary one. Briefly, reporter gets top story on political scandal, repercussions ensue, reporter digs up more information, the plot thickens (with emphasis on the word "thick"), revelations emerge, tragedy develops--and  headlines, headlines, headlines.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne does a competent job in his first starring role as the reporter Nick Mullen, but the real heart of the film is Denholm Elliot who turns in a smashing performance. If only he had been given more time on screen! He's really the soul of "Defense of the Realm", the one who we DO care about, because he's a fully fleshed out character--in fact, the only one. He's a real pleasure to watch and perfectly conveys the tremendous anxiety that high-level political secrets carry with them.<br /><br />Also on hand turning in competent performances are Greta Scacchi and Ian Bannen. But as is true of Nick Mullen, they are mostly undeveloped and only exist to move the plot along, such as it is.<br /><br />With more substantial writing in which characters were more fully developed, this would have been a much more gripping film. As it is, with its plot-heavy emphasis, it's a burden.

His acting was excellent in this movie.  His portrayal of a mental patient had me a believer.  The mention of a virus infecting everyone is even more relevant today ie. swine flu, avian virus etc..

This is the war room!" | review/text: Dr. Strangelove<br /><br />Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb<br /><br />I knew I would love this 1964 film from the beginning. As the opening Addams Family-esque credits by Pablo Ferro rolled over blatant love scenes between planes and phallic missiles and meadow lark love scene music trickled to my ears, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />General Jack D. Ripper (seriously) informs his British-Exchange officer Mandrake (the great Peter Sellers of Insp. Jacques Clousea fame, who plays several roles) that we will be going to "Plan R" in a shooting war against the Russians in order to preserve their precious bodily fluids... A cowboy hat-clad bomber pilot and his crew (which includes a young James Earl Jones' screen debut) set off to bomb the hell out of the russkies while the American government tries desperately to stop them.<br /><br />It is chock full of strange and funny details such as a binder with the title "World Targets in Megadeaths" or the bombers' survival kits including lipstick and nylons or the Russia Premier being named Kiss-off. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the conversations between Kissoff and President Muffley- where Peter Sellers really has a chance to shine.<br /><br />Kubrick did a lot of research before beginning to adapt Peter George's 1958 novel "Red Alert". Originally he intended it to be a serious film on nuclear devastation called "Edge of Doom", but later changed it to a satire to better voice his concerns. The result is the black and white classic full of stellar performances and quirky moments that rules the cult film section.<br /><br />I really recommend watching the special features on the DVD.<br /><br />The "interviews" with Scott and Sellers give a great look at Seller's remarkable ability to slide into different regional accents.<br /><br />The "Making of" featurette is also very informative and provides a great look at the cast.<br /><br />"You just start your countdown and old Bucky will be back before you can say Blast-Off!"

 | product/productId: 6302236266 | review/userId: A1JEFESGLIS076 | review/summary: At Best, Only Mildly Engaging, With Humourous Moments Overwhelmed By An Abundance Of Triteness. | review/text: This not unexpectedly little-known film is fabricated in quite the wrong way, with efforts by its co-leads to make something special of its flabby script being murdered by tepid direction, bringing a result that its occasional bright moments are halted soon after they appear, an especial shame as its romantically connected co-principals are fundamentally quite highly skilled players.  Chris Murdoch (Timothy Daly) and his business partner Jeff Simon (Michael Garin), having left successful employment with a commercial real estate firm in order to found their own company, are soon financially stiffened, and nearing bankruptcy.  When an opportunity arises for them to bid for the construction of a new facility for housing a large corporation, Reed and Reed, they enthusiastically prepare a contract proposal, and the corporation's C.E.O., William Reed (Kevin McCarthy), offers them encouragement; however, their status becomes muddled after Chris falls in love with Jennifer (Haviland Morris), who happens to be William's daughter, upon whom he dotes.  Additionally, William's brother Arthur (David Doyle), the other of the two corporate titular Reeds, is identifying reasons to offer the pending lucrative contract to more seasoned individuals who are representing Chris and Jeff's former employer.  A possible ray of hope for the young partners is enjoyed when Chris and Jennifer become lovers.  Unfortunately, Jennifer, who works at a nearby Long Island marine research center, is soon disenchanted with Chris after he outlines his plan to construct condominiums near the site of the research center.  During this same period that Chris and Jennifer are frolicking, Jeff has begun an affair with LuAnn (Shelley Fabares), William Reed's wife, highly inconvenient as this liaison of the loins is known to Arthur and also to the principal competitors who are vying with Chris and Jeff for the sought-after contract.  Further, the young entrepreneurs may have their chance of prosperity stopped by all of these romantic shenanigans, and their very existence reduced to a state of penury.  In quaint fashion, the scenario has the entire imbroglio being clarified by a tennis match between the Reeds held at their private club!  Essentially a romantic melodrama, the film's foremost acting contributions are turned in by Daly and Morris, who diligently work at creating their roles; as well as from veterans McCarthy and Fabares, who do their best with feebly written dialogue.  Clich&eacute;s abound, and the soundtrack's selected musical recordings are generally obtrusive, while the film's direction is by the numbers.<br />In sum, there is precious little of merit to be seen here, although whenever the camera's eye focusses upon Daly the action becomes a bit more interesting.

The sound track is incredible, and the photography will blow you away. I saw it in original IMAX format at the premier in Seattle and it was awesome. My favorite part is the U.S. Coast Guard sequence at Cape D (mainly because i'm in it-the guy on the left). That 2 minutes you see was 40 hours in the surf of pounding the crap out of everyone, director included. Just a great movie all the way around.

 | product/productId: 1404955119 | review/userId: AFJCOP0GKZH6C | review/summary: A clever rom-com with real heart | review/text: I watched this movie on a whim in a hotel room a while back, and it turned out to be a nice little romantic comedy. It tries a bit too hard to feel like Jerry Maguire (there is even a scene where one of the characters is watching the famous "You complete me" scene), but Will Smith is admirable in the lead as a "date doctor" who encounters a little trouble when trying to find love himself. A movie like this does not require much analysis, except to say that it is well-crafted and there are a few funny moments, especially in some of the scenes with co-star Kevin James. One thing it excels at is defying most of the cliches of your standard Hollywood rom-com. The ending is a little hackneyed, but by that time the film had endeared itself to me so much that I didn't care.

As for the DVD itself all you get is scene access,trailer and behind the camrea(which  basically tells everyone the whole movie! ) I wish Paramount would start  puttinf extras like commentey, pan/sca &amp;widescreen,production notes  etc.. that Universal,New Line and Warner Bros does to name a few ! My  advice is if want this DVD is rent it first before you buy it! Other than  that it's &quot;The Fugitive 3&quot; with Tommy Lee Jones in his same old  role from that movie and Ashley Judd as the fugitive! If you live in the  state of Washington, this movie shows us some very beautiful areas of that  wonderful state!
 | product/productId: 6301016874 | review/userId: A2Q97PJN7DB3ZS | review/summary: gorgeous to watch | review/text: I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out, then again when the DVD first came out, then again last year.  The first time I saw it I loved this movie as I did the second time.  The third time I was wishing it could be edited abit more.  Some scenes seemed endless.  I watched it with my brother a few yrs ago and about came to blows over it.  He made some very anti-Catholic remarks that hit me the wrong way.  So I guess those with other eyes will each reach a different conclusion.  We will be watching it soon with a friend who is an indigenous person from Bolivia.  I will be very interested to see his reaction.  I also watched the movie with someone from India.  They knew nothing of this history.<br /><br />The story is touching and to me asks the question "Is pacifism or violence the answer to evil"?  And it doesn't give you the answer.  The scenery is truly breathtaking.<br /><br />I would recommend the movie but you probably need to be in the right mood to watch.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching the extra disc with how they made the movie.  Found it as interesting as the movie.

On top of this, you get excellent bonuses: excellent documentaries, comments, still galleries,... What more can I say? Paramount is doing its best with their classics!...<p>Top performances by the very attractive two leads' (Kelly and Grant)....in fact Kelly never looked so ravishing and gorgeous than here, only perhaps in "The Swan" (1956)....being one the most sensual, elegant and beautiful women of all time....a Real Goddess-come-to-earth.....How can someone so perfect did ever exist!And besides talented!Grant his usual man-of-the-world, excellent timing, top actor and comedian.<p>Great support by the wonderful character actor John Williams and by everybody's favorite sophisticated mother: Jessie Royce Landis (although here she plays a woman of humble origins who became rich because of Oil being found in her Oklahoma Ranch-anyway she looks and behaves like a Queen) and by French grand actor Charles Vanel.<p>And what about those great landscapes of the South of France (Cannes, Monaco, Cte D'Azr,...), breathtaking!!<p>Vintage Hollywood Classic.

Never has an animal performed with such emotion as Comet does in this tear-jerker, yet satisfying movie.  The human stars take back seats to both Fluke and Rombo (wonderfully voiced by the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson).  Nancy Travis had the glowing warmth and beauty needed to convey the hopelessness Fluke must feel in realizing he can't have his life back.  Based on a novel by spook writer James Herbert, the script pulls a real doozy on you at the end, and it's finale in the cemetery is poignantly touching.  Without using the techniques in BABE (Which were fine for that movie), FLUKE captures your heart by showing you the love a dog can bring into a life, especially when it's been reincarnated.  A wonderful film, let your kids watch it, and discuss it with them.  It's life to have loss.  But the gain is always around the corner.  Well done, guys!

 | product/productId: 555407734X | review/userId: A1TP3ZYYNA6KNE | review/summary: How bad is it....................... | review/text: I have to tell you a true story; the poster art was so cool I had to see this picture, yet what I got was the biggest disappointment next to The Avengers. The film starts off with a great idea and the opening scenes show good promise when the crew of a nuclear-armed space station has to react to World War 3. A few months later they have to bail out when an earth-based hacker discovers they might have a load of nukes onboard. Once on ground one of their party falls prey to an unknown predator while the other two have to contend with a gang run by a teenager.  The rest of the movie is a bore as it turns into a cheap Mad Max/Road Warrior knock-off.<p>Like many of these films, they all lack the one element that made Mad Max so great, non-stop action. This movie is boring and looks cheap. The only cool thing is the opening scenes and the super cool poster.  I wonder why this would even be released on DVD, as I can't remember a single actor I would recognize.

How often does one enjoy a re-make as well as the original?  Jack Benny and Carol Lombard are wonderful in the 1942 original, a must-see, but I love this version just as much - Jos&eacute; Ferrer steals the show along with a host of great modern character actors.  This is a more refined, less raw Mel Brooks comedy, with a wonderful homage to the original.  Charles Durning is fabulous as well as the entire well-cast cast.  I have been patiently waiting to replace my VHS with a DVD version.  Hello?  How much longer do I have to wait?

 | product/productId: 1896306292 | review/userId: A26UW8DNN74AGK | review/summary: A Late, Great Performance from Trevor Howard | review/text: Catholics begins as a rather melodramatic film presenting a group of fanatical monks on an island off Ireland - an island off an island - who refuse to follow the Vatican's orders to give up the Latin mass in favor of  a liturgy in English.  Martin Sheen arrives on the island, with strict  orders in hand that the monks obey the Vatican, no questions asked.  How  the monks dramatize their grievances against the Holy See is not, however,  the true climax of the film.  Trevor Howard, the Father Superior of the  sect, confesses to Martin Sheen that he's been unable to pray because of a  crisis of faith he suffered at Lourdes several years prior.  Sheen wonders  why he hasn't requested a transfer or retirement.  Howard tells him how  important he and the other monks are to the islanders, and that their  community work is more important than his inability to pray.  By the close  of the film, with Sheen exiting in his Helicopter as all the monks are  gathered below, buffetted by the wake of the propeller blades, the very  real and moving drama of one man's crisis of faith, made all the more  moving by Trevor Howard, becomes painfully real for us.

 | product/productId: 1573471046 | review/userId: A3MSQL0L4DM98Q | review/summary: A Little Blood, A Few Scares, Lots of Fun | review/text: TOURIST TRAP is a film for the horror afficionado, not the casual horror fan. If you like shock, gore and nail-biting, screaming scare scenes, this may bore you. If you've spent hundreds of hours watching all-night camp fright flicks and have a soft spot in your heart for good (not great) and slightly goofy films a la MOTEL HELL, you'll fall in love with TOURIST TRAP.<p>The set-up is the same you've seen a thousand times. Three gals and two guys break down in the woods, go skinny dipping and then die one by one. You know by the second murder who the killer &quot;really&quot; is and also which heroine will survive the carnage (this one plays by all the standard rules). Still, you've got a great cornball factor with Chuck &quot;Rifleman&quot; Connors in the Jim Siedow-esque role of helpful country bumpkin and a bona fide Scream Queen in Jocelyn Jones (easily the best performer in the film, her eyes convey true terror - it's a pity she didn't make a career of this).<p>The film fails in the pacing department and we have too many escapes and recaptures and escapes again after the killer's identity is revealed two-thirds of the way through the film. Still, there is a genuine creep factor in the apearance and manipulation of the mannequins (and Ms. Jones' mental breakdown at the film's end has the viewer wondering if they're really alive as well), though it's almost cancelled out by the notion of the lunatic slasher wielding psychokinetic powers as well. Coming five years after TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the vision of the hulking killer in a woman's mask surrounded by an artifical family of mannequins doesn't seems as original and eerie as it should.<p>All in all, though, TOURIST TRAP is fun viewing - and actually appropriate for the young horror fan (no nudity, cursing and very little blood) as well. This DVD, from Koch Vision Entertainment, looks great and boasts a nice selection of extra features, all at an incredibly reasonable price. Not the best by far, but this will undoubtedly warm the heart of anyone who enjoys films such as Tobe Hooper's FUNHOUSE, ALICE SWEET ALICE, MOTEL HELL, HELL NIGHT, and PHANTASM. Grab WAXWORK and make it a double feature!

 | product/productId: 0790740281 | review/userId: A2MMDV260HV1PZ | review/summary: Judgment City | review/text: This film is about a man named Daniel Miller who is hit by a bus. He dies and goes to a place where he can be judged so it can be determined where he should go from there. He meets a woman named Julia there whom he befriends. Daniel is directed to a courtroom where scenes from his life are replayed and the people in charge of his case defend and accuse his right and wrong actions.<br /><br />This film shows creativeness about what could happen after one dies, what it could be like in the afterlife before a person is given instructions on where to go next. It opens ones eyes to pay attention to how they treat others and how they react and respond to their lives in the present. There is a small amount of bad language in the film, which is the only reason why I gave it a 4 stars, although to some it could be considered light bad language. I viewed this film on my Kindle Fire and was happy with the quality.

Controversial, censored, re-censored, and re-released.<p>The film itself is quite impressive for the time it was released. The film was also heavily cut for it's theatrical release the &quot;snails and oysters&quot; scene is probably the most famous of the cut scenes. This scene was cut for its sly reference to bisexuality where Crassus attempts to seduce one of his servants by telling him that he likes eating both snails and oysters (which can be compared as being attracted to both men and women.) The audio of this scene was damaged so Anthony Hopkins read Lawrence Olivier's dialog.<p>The story follows Spartacus, a Roman gladiator who leads a slave revolt against Rome. He later gains a major following and the senate argues as to how to stop him.<p>Spartacus is portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the film and looks remarkably like his son Michael Douglas.<p>The DVD is loaded with special features <p>There are two audio commentaries one with an alternate musical soundtrack.<br />There is a restoration demonstration, theatrical trailer, sketches by director Stanley Kubrick, storyboards, hundreds of publicity photos, lobby cards, production photos and other ephemera.<p>There are also numerous interviews and behind the scenes footage. The interviews are with Peter Ustinov which were made in 1960 and 1992, There is also an interview with Jean Simons made in 1960 There is also newsreel footage of the filmmakers attending various funtions. Finally there is an extended scene and surviving audio of a deleted scene. There is also a showing of the script from a deleted scene that has been lost.<p>This is a release that should not be missed.

Although not completely "by the book", the dashing Anthony Andrews manages to capture the essence of Percy. From his fop-headed Sir Percy to his debonaire Pimpernel, the portrayal of his character is expertly matched. Not to be undone, Jane Seymour's impression of the most beautiful woman in French revolution-era England and France is wonderful. The passion/chemistry between the two is perfect. And the trickery of the Pimpernel's escape plans to save some French aristocracy from the citizens of France adds just the right amount of mystery and intrigue to interest even the male gender. Exquisite for a made-for-tv movie.

 | product/productId: 0780629450 | review/userId: A5TZXWU8AALIC | review/summary: DVD or not DVD? | review/text: Wow, I would've really thought this film would've been on DVD by now.<br /><br />I saw it in a theatre and loved it.  Everyone's going to have their favorites as Hamlet but I actually enjoy most of the ones I've seen.<br />I have Richard Burton's filmed performance but I've always enjoyed Burton (See him in BECKET with Peter O'Toole).  Olivier's take is a classic.  I just bought Kevin Kline's DVD and liked it.  The first real connection I had to the play was Mel Gibson's in 1990 and that one is still my favorite: I like Hamlet more when I really think he's cracking up.<br /><br />So I was thrilled with Kenneth Brannagh's "complete" film of the play, although I wish it had been presented as a mini-series.  There are several scenes and speeches that feel rushed to keep the momentum moving.  The modern viewer is used to having entertainment last an hour and a half--or just a couple of minutes!  In Shakespeare's time, there were no other channels and people had all day.<br /><br />I liked the casting for the most part, but Jack Lemmon as a palace guard and other choices were odd, almost jarring.<br /><br />Charlton Heston should have been at least nominated for a Best Supporting Actor for his brief but compelling role as the Player King.  Now THAT'S a Shakespearean performance!<br /><br />Brannagh was nominated for screenplay adaption (!) at the Oscars that year but his passion for the role and his determination to film it on a epic scale deserved much more.<br /><br />Definitely on the Must Buy for my collection.

When we last saw Jason the killer, he had an ax right through his hockey mask and into his face.<br />  On this VHS, we are treated to a 2 and a half minute montage of the first Friday the 13th (1980), Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) and Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D (1982), to catch us up on what is going on.<br />  Only Terry Ballad returns from Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D (1982) as a State Trooper in this film.<br />  The film begins only moments after where the third film ended.  The ambulence and the police are there at the barn.  Jason's body (Ted White) is loaded in the ambulence and taken to the hospital morgue.  While morgue attendent, Axel (Bruce Mahler) and nurse Morgan (Lisa Freeman) are making-out, Jason awakes and ultimatly kills both.<br />  Six young adults (Lawrence Monoson, Crispin Glover, Barbara Howard, Jodie Aronson, Alan Hayes, Peter Barton) rent a abin across from the Jarvis family.

I was appalled to discover two first rate actors, Richard Burton and Lee Marvin, as the protagonists. I've seen "disaster zone" movies before and I must say that the Klansman makes the top five! The only reason to watch this movie is to see Burton-Marvin "acting" as part of a sentimental journey into the past... There's nothing else to recommend this complete failure.

 | product/productId: 0767849981 | review/userId: A25SD2CCR99DFW | review/summary: Nice trip down memory lane! | review/text: I saw this movie back when I was a teen and thought it was hilarious. When I saw it was available on DVD, I had to buy it immediately.  I have bought some flicks that I liked as a kid, and after watching them as an adult thought "How could I have ever liked that"?  That is not the case with this movie. It does seem a bit disjointed, watching the different story lines play out, but the movie is just as funny to me now as it was 25 years ago. Don't expect to have your life changed by  watching this movie, but if you grew up in the 60's, 70's, or even the 80's, I think you'll get a kick out of this one!
 | product/productId: 1558801596 | review/userId: AUM3YMZ0YRJE0 | review/summary: 20 years later, still hits home | review/text: When I first saw this film, I was utterly mesmerized by the lively, tumultuous tableau that Lee so masterfully painted.  The dazzling array of characters, the tensions (racial or otherwise) that needed release in the heat, the sense of a fractious community - Lee really held it together.  Then the climax of violence that came, from the spark of a needless killing, and threatened to engulf everyone.  I loved it then and loved it now, 20 years after I first saw it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the film had aged considerably for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, race relations have evolved decisively.  We have a black president, in spite of all our persistent problems of poverty, under-achievement, and drugs.  But I also found some of the acting a bit stilted, even from two great actors, Aiello and Samuel Jackson; even Ossie Davis and Turturro seemed locked in rather two-dimensional characters.  Moreover, the complete absence of the drug culture makes the picture incomplete.  Lastly, I found the climax, and particularly Mookie's unexpected action, harder to believe than I did when younger.  As such, I find that there are new productions, such as the incomparable The Wire, have succeeded far better in exploring through art the issues that underlie America's ongoing urban crisis.<br /><br />That being said, many of the performances are still fresh, both hilarious and affecting.  The trio of men (with Sweet Dick WIllie) in ongoing dialogue, the wonderful anger of Rosie Perez, and the simmering rage of Ruby Dee are worth the price of admission.  Moreover, the internal dialogue that the film is designed to provoke - similar to Bertold Brecht - is as effective and relevant as ever.  This is a pioneering work that is well worth viewing again.  It may even become a classic.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

I've watched it every year for years.  I agree that it should be released on DVD; the prices for VHS are too high for a medium that tears up easily.  The storyline, about a singing star who escapes back to the area she came from to get away from showbiz, is cute but it's Dolly who makes the part.  The kids are adorable and I personally think that John Ritter has the best small part he ever played.  He just shines (and amuses you) as a judge.  I'd watch the show for that alone.  The witch is good, too, in a corny sort of way.  When she eats the pie and Dolly says, "Goodnight, Irene" I always laugh.  The songs are pretty good, too.  Give it a try!
 | product/productId: 1594351554 | review/userId: A2R1HAXRNU0QX7 | review/summary: Crisp, solid, amusing and WELL-ACTED!! | review/text: I reluctantly rented this on one of those days when you go to the store, and everything you think you want to see is already out. I had read a few good reviews of SHATTERED GLASS, but just didn't find the subject matter all that compelling.  But I went ahead and got it, and I'm VERY glad I did.<p>It tells the story of young Stephen Glass, a reporter for The New Republic (and others) and details  how eventually one of his stories (and much later, lots of others) slowly unraveled to be revealed as a complete falsehood.<p>There isn't much action in the movie...lots of talking.  But the pacing is brisk, clean and never wastes a moment. The acting is thorougly committed and the writing is superb.  We are sucked in to the story almost instantly, and it is kept nice and easy for us to follow...with relish!<p>Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker in Parts II &amp; III) is really good as Glass.  We see how he totally ingratiates himself with everyone, so that they are willing to stand up for him.  And when he's caught in little &quot;inaccuracies,&quot; he apologizes so thoroughly and genuinely, people always cut him slack.  We never really get an idea of WHY he does it...we have to guess.  And this isn't really a vacuum for the viewer...it makes us believe that Glass is just...simply...EMPTY.<p>Peter Sarsgard plays his editor, a nerdy, serious guy, not very popular with his staff, who slowly begins to see the scope of what's happened to his beloved magazine.  He discovers that they've been dupped, and he's willing to put himself right at the top of the list of who has been duped.  He is a hero without many heroic qualities...and this makes him sympathetic and believable.  It's the best performance in a film full of great performances.<p>Hank Azaria, Stephen Zahn (a favorite of mine), Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson are the other &quot;names&quot; involved.  All are good in small roles.<p>The movie just feels so clean and compact.  No wasted time.  You don't get drawn in like you would in something REALLY heavy like a MYSTIC RIVER or HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG.  The movie is to cynical and amusing for that.  But it is still an engrossing story...one you can share with teenagers.<p>Also, on the DVD, we get the complete 60 Minutes story about Glass.  Watch it right after the movie...it's 12 minutes well spent!!

 | product/productId: 6300268012 | review/userId: A2Q457CES5ZUZ | review/summary: Political Realism Presented Entertainingly | review/text: &quot;The Candidate&quot; was released in the appropriate year of 1972, when Richard Nixon was reelected, using the media to present himself as a solid, trusted leader who was being challenged by liberal elitists operating in concert with the Eastern media establishment.  When the full force of Watergate buried Nixon in scandal shortly thereafter, resulting in his resignation in 1974, the messages presented in &quot;The Candidate&quot; became all the clearer as Nixon's hollow facade lay fully exposed.<p>Jeremy Larner, a former speechwriter for presidential candidate Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968, used his political savvy to craft a script based on the realism of campaigning in the television age, in which, to use Marshall McLuhan's apt phrase, &quot;the medium is the message.&quot;  Larner copped a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for his effort.  Robert Redford plays Bill McKay, who runs a poverty law center and has no ambitions to seek political office.  He is urged to do so as the Democrats in California seek an opponent for a solidly entrenched incumbent U.S. Senator played by Don Porter.  Redford, whose father, played by Melvyn Douglas, is a former California governor, agrees to run after being told that he can address topics on his own terms.  The idea is that he is expected to make a decent run but is not expected to win.  Redford articulates ideas near and dear to him that are not embraced by the broad spectrum of California voters.  When he runs poorly in the primary, however, he is informed that he needs to make changes or risk being humiliated in the general election by Porter, a prospect he does not relish.<p>Redford's ensuing frequent turnabouts on major issues make him anything but the refreshingly candid candidate he sought to become.  As the polls close and there is possible light at the end of the long campaign tunnel, Redford becomes more of a blurry media creation and loses the old image of refreshingly solid commitment he had previously displayed.<p>Eventually Redford upsets Porter.  By the time the long race ends he is immersed in a total blur.  The film's closing line is a gem.  After winning the race Redford, seated in his hotel room with his campaign staff, asks, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;<p>&quot;The Candidate&quot; was one of director Michael Ritchie's finest efforts.  The pacing becomes gradually stepped up as the campaign moves into its important stretch run.  By the end the viewer is immersed in the same kind of non-stop, frenzied blur as are the candidates and their staffs, providing a graphic display of political realism via the camera's all-seeing eye.
 | product/productId: 6302447704 | review/userId: AJLW1DZSHOVGW | review/summary: A SPECIAL FILM!! | review/text: This film is deeply touching, extremely humorous at times, and beautifully executed by the cast and adept director, Ida Lupino.  It's about two newly enrolled juveniles whose greatest joy in life is pulling pranks on the unsuspecting.  And Mother Superior's attempts to achieve some order.  <p>Roz Russell carries the film with her intelligence and strength. She is fascinating in the role of Mother Superior. Hayley Mills is saying goodby to her childhood, both on and off screen. And it is a wonderful goodby. June Harding, who plays her best friend, is perfectly supporting. Everyone adds to the film. The convent and its grounds are beautifully caught by the cinematographer, and the surprise ending is very satisfying.<p>If you have children, this movie will be a delight for them. If you are a child at heart, the movie will speak to you. This is also a film about women, and there is something soft and tender feelingwise and thinkingwise in the film's ambience. <p>I loved it. And I am not young. At least not in years.

In an era where white producers were rolling black films through an assmebly line like process, every blue moon, one would transend it's stereotypical script and give birth to a true star.  Pam Grier takes the paper thin plot (a slightly twisted woman who goes on a vigilante crusade against drug dealers)and turns in a what would become the prototype female hero.  Well worth seeing because of Ms. Grier's excellent ability to make us believe in her cause.
 | product/productId: 6301942647 | review/userId: A3RZ6FC0Z5AUEL | review/summary: One of the 10 best films of all time | review/text: This is perhaps a tough film to review because it is highly personal in nature, being composed of the dreams of its author; however, being highly personal does not mean it lacks universality, in fact quite the contrary. Akira Kurosawa is widely recognised as one of the greatest film makers of the twentieth century, i.e. in film-making history. He himself described this film - and I paraphrase from memory - as the film he had always wanted to make, his ultimate and best film. I do not believe that this is because the particular story-lines in the film were so important but because using the medium of dreams, Kurosawa was able to delve into a level of storytelling far deeper than much of his previous work and explore further subtleties of texture, nuance, psychology, colour, mood and so on. That said, the themes and stories on the surface are of interest because they evoke quintessentially Japanese pre and post war issues, also the perceptions of childhood, of adulthood, of facing death, of nostalgia. However, using the medium of a dream, Kurosawa can penetrate deep into the heart of each vignette to give us unsurpassably lovely and profound entries into the heart of particular moods, for ultimately this is what each story is: a very profound, almost sub-consciously- inhabited mood piece. Both in esoteric buddhism and Shinto, with both of which Kurosawa was culturally familiar to say the least, moods can be regarded as the gateway into the central channel of enlightenment; in other words, rather than avoid feelings and passions in order to engender peace or purity, instead you dive into their turbulent waves to thereby enter the deeper, silent ocean of awareness beneath. This he does beautifully with each piece, and in fact once you connect with this dynamic, many of the stories lay open to fuller enjoyment, like a main course served up at a banquet. In nearly every piece there is an encounter with a world beyond the immediately perceived one, and yet linked in feeling, in mood, in terms of season, colour, surrounding, context and so on. And then the 'deity' of that particular landscape or situation emerges, either as the gods and goddesses of the peach tree orchard, the foxes in the forest, van Gogh, the ice storm deities or whatever, the deity being the quintessential expression of the mood freed from any burdens of being bound to everyday normalcy, function or timeframe - a pure expression. In essence, this film is a study - or teaching -  in the union of awareness and emotion; as such it is incredibly precise, playful, artistic and profound. I urge anyone who has not seen it to do so. It is unquestionably one of the greatest masterpieces of cinematic art in history and will remain so for centuries, I suspect, long after many others have faded from memory.
 | product/productId: 0767832485 | review/userId: A3RWR50VUII07D | review/summary: A Glacial look at English Blitz love | review/text: I purposely avoided this film when it was theatrically released.The opinions were too varied for me to care enough to see for myself.So, now that I own the DVD it was time. BURRRRRRR!!!! What a cold and repressed piece of film.It's hard to put into words exactly what was so disconnecting for me about "The End of the Affair";was it the detached performances of Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes who are supposed to be passionately and irretrievably in passionate lust for each other during the Blitz of London?;was it the terribly disjointed way in which the script unfolded never allowing me to feel enough sympathy/empathy for any character? was it the terribly cliched dialog that tried to make this film seem as though Bogart and Bergman should be playing the roles? Or was it the immensely disturbing soundtrack of Michael Hyman who insisted on replaying the same infernal "lone theme" throughout this incredibly tedious and cold ,repressed piece of clap?<br />There are more than enough reasons to look elsewhere for a romantic WW2 tragic romance.This was just a tragic film.PASS!
 | product/productId: 0790729687 | review/userId: AAPSSWZN1E4DF | review/summary: Enthralling and enticing. | review/text: The characters in "Interview with the Vampire" are a bit overplayed, but the lives and the world portrayed by them are dark, beautiful, and enticing. The characters are quite charismatic and memorable, from the supremely evil Lestat (Tom Cruise), to the melancholy foil of Lestat, Louis (Brad Pitt), a two-hundred year old vampire torn by guilt and remorse. Perhaps the most charismatic and best portrayed character, was Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She was "born into darkness" at eight years of age, fed on by Louis and turned to darkness by Lestat. Beautiful, dark, intelligent, and sophisticated, Claudia feels none of the regret that Louis does. Indeed, her blood lust is equal to or greater than Lestat's. The lives led by vampires are highly romanticized in "Interview..." They are enticing, their world unbelievably intriguing, yet they are children of darkness, knowing no light, no release from their eternal lonliness, except when they kill. This perhaps, is the ultimate irony. Though not terribly subtle or complex, this movie was extremely well done, and I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for gothic romance or vampire movies.

 | product/productId: 1572523700 | review/userId: A2CW9IQAPFEYLM | review/summary: No "dog" here: this movie is terrific | review/text: This is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy (Anton Glanzelius) who tries to make sense of his mother's terminal illness, death in general, and a world full of change. He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous. A real gem of a movie.

Although I've never really liked Debra Winger in her movie roles, she brought a refreshing sense of realism to her role of Joy in this film.  The tour de force, however, belongs to Anthony Hopkins.  We understand all his detachments and his eventual great emotional entanglements that allow him to finally live a life that had been held at arms length before.<br /><br />One of the last scenes in which C.S. Lewis sits upstairs with his step-son trying to piece together the effects of Joy's death cuts me to the heart every time I see it.  Anthony Hopkins is so genuine and finally lets that emotional dam break in a most believable while still subtle way.  I treasure this movie and only wish it had received more acclaim in theaters.  It is a jewel to add to your home collection.  I highly recommend it.

Forget the silly story and just watch him dance and dance and dance.  He does more with a turn of a shoulder than most dancers can do with their whole body.  This movie also introduced the lithe and lovely Leslie Caron as the object of Kelly's affection.  The film builds to its dramatic hallucinatory conclusion as Kelly dances his way across a Paris dreamscape, that brings all the elements of modern dance together in a tour-de-force that was unprecedented in musicals of that time.  You can't help getting swept away in the feel-good spirit of this movie.  It was another time and place.

 | product/productId: 6302383455 | review/userId: A2ITY3O2UPJLN8 | review/summary: This is going to sound like an echo. | review/text: I have to concur with the other reviewers here who not only want to see this version on DVD.  They want to see it in its original theatrical format (16:9 vs. 4:3).  I'm assuming this set is 4:3 because, while I own it, I've not watched it yet (no VCR).  However, I'd seen the tapes before via rental and seem to recall them being 4:3.<br /><br />When the DVDs came out, I bought them, too.  And while I liked Part I, I hated Part II because of all the bouncing around between events prior to Part I and Part II events.  And even though I liked the Part 1 DVD version, it lacked the historical background that can only be found in this chronological VHS version.  The one glaring example I point out to friends is that, in the VHS epic version, you get to see a young Hyman Roth being introduced to a young Vito Corleone ... with Vito semi-adopting him into his family.  Later in the Part II DVD version, viewers are not aware of this connection.  Roth is not just betraying Michael, he's betraying the "family" that adopted him ... making his betrayal MORE than a betrayal ... an "infamnia" (the worst kind of betrayal).<br /><br />Incidentally, while brand new VCRs are hard to come by, there are a number of DVD/VCR combos for sale here at Amazon (and cheaply).  Heck, Amazon still sells blank VHS tapes (grin).  But Amazon also sells "PVR" devices by Hauppauge that will "capture" the VHS output from a VCR, ignore the copy-protection, and allow the captured program to be saved to a computer (via USB) in real-time as an MPEG2 file (easily authored for DVD burning).  So, before too long, I'll buy a DVD/VCR combo, a Hauppauge PVR, capture this version, and burn it to DVD - before the tapes deteriorate any further.  That is, UNLESS it comes out on DVD (probably not likely).<br /><br />Bottom line?  This version is, by far, the BEST version of events that transpire in what we know now as Part I and Part II.  Frankly, the content blows those "parts" right out of the water.

 | product/productId: 6301969588 | review/userId: A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO | review/summary: A curiosity in the history of filmaking-no more,no less | review/text: Freaks,released in February 1932,was and is a title that says as much about itself as it does about its' subject matter.It was a curiosity then and remains so to this day.Judged on its' merits as a film,and all that that implies,it comes up far short of its'intended goals.<br />Browning had previously worked with Lon Chaney who was THE master of grotesquery in his characterizations.He also had directed the horror hit Dracula the year previously.Mix this with the so called "Great Depression" and the studios desperation to keep their heads above water and looking for new ideas to intice patrons into the theatres,and you have the movie Freaks.<br />The movies' centrepiece is two midgets,Hans and Frieda(Harry and Daisy Earles-real life brother and sister).Both are part of the "freak" section of the circus performers and are engaged to be married.Enter trapeze artist Cleopatra(Olga Baclanova)who catches the eye of little Hans.She humours and eggs him on by flirting openly with him,much to Frieda's chagrin and embarrassement.Cleopatra however goes for the circus strongman Hercules(Henry Victor) and they both take great delight in humiliating Hans and the other "freaks" frequently.<br />When Cleopatra learns that Hans has alot of money she talks him into marrying her.Frieda tries to tell Hans it's a sham,but he won't listen and goes ahead with the marriage.During a reception it becomes apparent to Hans things aren't what they should be when Hercules kisses Cleopatra openly.And when the "freaks" in attendance chant that they "accept her"(Cleopatra),she becomes enraged at the thought and tells them to take a hike.During the reception she had slipped a poison into Hans drink-starting early to get rid of him and collect on his money.She carries him back to the wagon and a doctor is summoned,as she feigns innocence.She convinces the doctor but the spurned"freaks" are getting wise to the situation and keep a close watch.Sure enough when Cleopatra is alone she slips poison into Hans medicine.Hans however has gotten wise himself and spits out each dose when Cleo isn't looking.Hans has had it and decides,along with his friends,to take care of cheating/murdering Cleopatra and Hercules.When Hercules goes after his ex girlfriend Venus,who threatened to take what she knew about the two of them to the police,the "freaks" are right there.On a rain soaked,mud filled ground Hercules tries to crawl away with a knife in his side from the approaching threat,but he is eventually overtaken.At the same time Cleopatra runs screaming into the night from her wagon only to be followed by more "freaks",who get their woman.The movie ends as it had begun,with people standing around a large square enclosure,inside which is the former Cleopatra,now a "freak" and a much deformed "duck woman".<br />This slight tale of revenge was banned in a few countries around the world due to its' graphic and exploitative subject matter.It was released ,pulled,re-released again and again(parred down),but it still received terrible reviews and bombed at the box office.Actual circus performers("freaks") as you can see were "used" heavily in the movie for authenticity.You have pinheads,a half woman-half man,more than one armless woman,siamese twins,the living torso,bird girl,a dwarf,a legless dwarf,and several others.What brings the movie down isn't so much the obviously contrived script of righting a wrong but the poor acting involved.Most of the "freaks" did fairly well all things considered,but Olga Baclanova as Cleo and her brutish boyfriend Hercules played by Henry Victor,troll for new depths in bad acting.Olga plays it way,way over the top and Victor comes along to push down them both down the slippery slope on the other side.You actually wonder what took them so long to do them in! On the other side of the coin is Venus(Leila Hyams) and Phroso(Wallace Ford),who save the film from total oblivion.Rose Dione as Madame Tetrallini also manages to make the most of her on screen time.<br />Sure one feels an empathy towards these men and women,the underbelly of the circus world,but it is an empathy that Browning unnecessarily pounds home.Not only does he show fellow "normal" circus perfomers shunning them(not generally the case in real life)just to achieve a modicum of a plot,the re-issue prologue REALLY pounds home the sympathy message by its' sermonization.At the end of the day however there just is not enough good to overcome the bad in this film.It was a brave experiment on Browning's and MGM's parts,but it didn't come off.<br />As you know the film we see today is a cut down version of the original.Unless some archive somewhere turns up a longer copy,this is the film posterity will be left with.Having said that though,I do not believe this film would have been helped by the extra footage.I think it would just have prolonged the agony and possibly made it even worse than what we have today.The film was revived some 30 years or more ago by a film enthusiast and caught on with other film devotees due to its' unsual subject matter,which caused MGM to eventually rustle through its' holdings,dig it out and dust off its' copies.It was re-released On VHS in 1990 and now it is on DVD.<br />The DVD's print here is of good quality and sound.The sound in fact has been improved since its' 1990 release on tape.You can now understand most of the dialogue,though some spoken by the circus performers are still a little hard to catch.This release contains three alternate endings to the film,a re-issue prologue,a commentary and two featurettes,one on Tod Browning and one on the movie itself.<br />In conclusion Freaks,an interesting curiosity-yes;an experiment not fulfilled or succesful-yes.An example of good film making?....definitely not.

This movie is definitely worth renting if not buying.  Original, unpredictable story line, a bit convoluted here and there, but it never lets you down.  The CGI effects are kinda dated as of this writing, but the comedic acting is right on target.<br /><p><br />Though the film has elements of Beetlejuice, Ghost, The 6th Sense, and Ghostbusters, it's still original in its own right.  It may take you a little time to appreciate the director's vision, but when you do you'll have a good time.<br /><p><br />...
 | product/productId: 1569311765 | review/userId: A2G5OF42TD84W9 | review/summary: One of my favorite ever... | review/text: No, this is not a bladerunner/armitage story about the ethical deal of robot/humans coexisting. Nonetheless, this is an amazing anime that combines tech and supernatural together, along with an extremely powerful story.<p>This story's is about key's &quot;human&quot; experiences in Tokyo. It focuses on her relationship with her closest friend Sakura (and you'll find out their real relation in I think ep 13 or 14); a religious guy who wants her to use her power to keep the faith of his followers; a celebrity producer who is quite strange up there; and the ambitious, rich, insane villain (man are they good at making him so...hateable) who is the source of all of Key's misfortunes.<p>Also...if you think Cowboy Bebop's directing is gorgeous, you should also take a look at this. The opening starts out with a pretty good and mysterious song, along with beautifully animated sequences. What I like best is how they end each episode, thought it's extremely hard to describe because you have to see it for yourself to believe me. Near the end, the ending song starts blending in, and then you get these sudden shifts of views which basically makes me want to watch the next episode right away. This whole series is a piece of art.

 | product/productId: 6301661745 | review/userId: A23Q1T4MXZHFM7 | review/summary: Can You Tell Which Are More &quot;Human&quot;? | review/text: This film in 1971, the third episode of Planet Of The Apes series, is very comic at first but it belies the ultimate catastrophe human beings will or will not be avoided in distant future. Previous two films are about 40th century Earth where apes with extraordinary intelligece rule the planet while men there are degraded into slave status despised by apes. It just reminds me of that of humans called &quot;yahoo&quot; similarly despised by horses in &quot;The Gullver's Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. Third of the series suddenly bring us back to present world to 1973. It might be the sort of Hollywood ploy we have seen in Jurassic Park II Lost World that made the bio-bred dinosaur to land in American soil. <p>Three ape scientists escaped from warring 40th century Earth landed somewhere off the American coast captured by the U.S. forces. They were first sent to the zoo but after Zira spoke &quot;Because I loath bananas&quot; they are suddenly welcomed as guests becoming sort of celebrity. The ape couple Zira and Cornelius are really comical and I can't help laughing at their witty remarks such as the ironical usage of &quot;human&quot; and &quot;beastly&quot;. But after government committee finds out about gloomy future awaiting us mankind, they orders to have their new-born baby killed. The couple escapes with the aid of their kind animal behaviorist and circus owner who might have devised a remarkable trick we will find out at the end of the film. <p>Overall it is enjoyable and entertaining film.

 | product/productId: 6300216748 | review/userId: A22RY8N8CNDF3A | review/summary: 1975 CIA Conspiracy Thriller | review/text: Joe Turner (Robert Redford) works in New York at the  "Historical Society", which is the front for a CIA operation that reviews all literature, books, magazines, etc. from all over the world for possible plots and schemes.  All ideas are fed into a computer that compares with CIA plots and international issues and threats.  Joe is just a researcher, not a CIA Agent, but learns a lot about espionage, just reading books and other materials through his job.<br /><br />Joe is late to work one rainy day in December and his boss corners him to let him know that a letter he sent the Langley CIA office was dismissed.  Joe folds up the letter and puts it in his pants pocket to deal with later.  His letter noted a realization that strong relationships were developing between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil producing countries and thought it was worth the CIA's effort to look into it.<br /><br />We meet all of Joe's co-workers - 6 of them besides Joe.  He starts his work and feeds pertinent information into the computer.  Around 11:30 he is the designated person to do the lunch run to the Deli a block away. He ducks out a back entrance to avoid much of the rainy areas.  While he is gone, the mailman is rung in the front door security.  Other men come with him as they tear up the security tapes.  Everyone in the office is killed within minutes and the killers leave.  When Joe returns he finds the front door open and his co-workers shot.  He soon realizes this is a hit and takes the receptionist's gun to protect himself as he runs to a phone booth to call the main CIA office.<br /><br />His CIA code name is Condor - and he calls to give his section chief the information of the hit.  He is told not to hang up the phone and to call again in two hours.  The CIA "clean-up" team arrives within minutes to clear the carnage.  They verify the killings to the main office.  The New York section chief is stunned and wants to know why a research office would be gunned down.  He calls his supervisor at CIA Headquarters.<br /><br />Joe in the meantime is totally paranoid and dodges and hides until he is to be brought "in from the cold" - but realizes a set up in a back alley is meant to kill him.  The agents he was to meet are an old friend (he trusts) and another CIA department head.  He realizes his own department head is trying to kill him and shoots him with the gun he picked up.  The Department head then shoots the other unknowing agent (a friend that Joe trusted). Now Joe feels he can trust no one.  He is desperate and kidnaps a woman that he saw in a clothing store, Kathy (Faye Dunaway).  They drive to her apartment and she lets him hide there, although he uses the gun to scare her.  He just needs time to figure out what to do next.<br /><br />The plot thickens and the action escalates.  There are exciting twists and turns.  Eventually Joe has his revenge.  A very rewarding spy movie!<br /><br />The other interesting notes on this movie is the technology 35 years ago.  The computers and phone systems are archaic, but did not detract from the plot.  Also the world issues on oil needs of the U.S. seem to always be in the news.
 | product/productId: 6301661737 | review/userId: A376UHS8GODI8W | review/summary: Why not 7 stars? | review/text: Now this is CINEMA!<br /><br />The Criterion Collection DVD is filled with extras, from original Japanese documentaries and interviews of the departed Kurosawa (with English subtitles, if needed) and a booklet containing scene sketches<br /><br />by the Master himself, which help you to understand why his movies are so poetic and his photography so masterful.<br /><br />The movie is presented uncut and in its full splendor. The sound is just a conventional Stereo, which is probably the original soundtrack.<br /><br />Pity, because if there had been a Surround division of the channels, some very spectacular battle scenes would have been more involving.<br /><br />But perhaps, Akira Kurosawa wanted precisely that, to avoid the viewer to be distracted by the fluff, and rather concentrate on the story he is trying to tell.<br /><br />Also known in the Western hemisphere as "The Shadow Warrior", this is truly an Epic picture with a very beautiful and touching storyline.<br /><br />This picture is the true and natural tie to other Kurosawa movies like "Seven Samurai", "Yojimbo", "Sanjuro" and "The Hidden Fortress".<br /><br />Unlike "Throne of Blood" (adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth) and "Ran" (adaptation of King Lear), both also masterpieces, "Kagemusha" is an original Japanese story and gives a thorough insight of Japan in the 17th Century.<br /><br />I always tought that Criterion was just out to steal our hard-earned money just for its name, but after having now bought Akira Kurosawa's "Ran", the present "Kagemusha", as well as Luchino Visconti's "The Leopard", I will stick to Criterion like CA Glue.<br /><br />Although pricey, it is through and through, money totally well-spent, for the quality in DVD rendition (very clean and sharp transfers), very acceptable sound, although some more work on this would be nicer, especially with more recent movies.<br /><br />Criterion has really proven that quality has its own price and believe me, I have never seen "Kagemusha" and "Ran" the way I have watched them on my flatscreen LCD HD TV.<br /><br />Going to the movies nowadays, with a technology like High Definition TVs, has totally become obsolete.<br /><br />DVDs, when properly treated and produced can knock out any movie theater in the world.<br /><br />Thank you Criterion for the work of love you put in remastering and transferring such classics on DVD, not to mention the tons of extras you include with them.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well worth its price.
 | product/productId: 0767849493 | review/userId: A2VG8F8TL6AYDR | review/summary: God bless Kevin Smith | review/text: I've never had such a struggle about awarding stars as I've had about this movie.  Just to throw my cards on the table here, my dad was a Lutheran preacher and I've had my own personal, er, Issues with The Whole God Question.  In the end I had to give it 4 stars because what Kevin Smith has  had a notably worthy crack at doing is to try and reinvent the idea of  faith for a generation of people who generally wouldn't be inclined to go  for it.  And any film that thanks Howard Stern, John Milton and Martin  Scorsese in the final credits has to have _something_ going on.<p>My  personal take on this movie is that, somewhere between screenplay and final  cut, it got semi-seriously mutilated.  Smith's published screenplay is more  or less what you see on screen, but there are episodes - such as Jay and  Silent Bob's muse-inspired outburst in a bar (all I'll say is that Silent  Bob raps) - that are cut from the film, leaving gaping holes in the plot.  That was the point where I began to wonder whether the film was falling to  bits.<p>But in the end it's an amazing, sui generis mixture of cheesy  jokes and theological adventure.  I wish that somebody had had the courage  to make the film that Smith originally wrote, because it could have been  one of the bizarrest classics Hollywood has ever seen.  As it is, it's a  cheap-but-brilliant movie which overcomes narrative incoherence and a  crippled FX budget to be a genuinely imaginative story about the virtue of  faith as against the human distortions of organised religion.<p>Linda  Fiorentino is great as the permanently harrassed  great-great-several-more-levels-of-great-niece of Jesus, who finds herself  on a quest to prevent the unmaking of existence; she has this air  throughout much of the movie of not quite believing what she's got herself  into, which is thoroughly appropriate.  Alan Rickman is splendidly louche  and drawly as Metatron, the voice of God; Jason Mewes as Jay is even more  hilariously annoying than usual, and Smith himself is proving with each of  his films to be a great silent comedian as the ridiculously taciturn Silent  Bob.  <p>The rest of the cast are on flying form.  It was inspired casting  to have golden boys Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as a pair of vengeful  slacker-ish angels; Affleck in particular, with the benefit of some  severely aristocratic cheekbones, works up an impressively lordly contempt  for human frailty.  Jason Lee is also excellently sleazy as the  white-suited demon Azrael.  There are crackling cameos by Guinevere Turner  (as a sarky bus station attendant) and Janeane Garofalo (as Fiorentino's  co-worker in the abortion clinic), and Alanis Morrissette as YHWH is,  frankly, perfect, in the same way that Sinead O'Connor was ideal casting as  the Virgin in Neil Jordan's &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;.<p>There's no doubt  that Kevin Smith is a brilliant and intelligent storyteller; I've loved his  previous films and I gobble up his comics.  His talent as a director is  maybe no more than adequate to the stories he wants to tell, but at least  it's adequate.  He probably ought to be writing epic poems, but then nobody  would read them.  This is a weirdly moving and provocative film; all the  fart gags and insistently low tone are of a piece with the central idea  that nothing of God's creation deserves to be denied.  In that sense, it's  one of the few genuinely faith-ful movies since Pasolini's &quot;Il Vangelo  Secondo Matteo&quot;.  The church should be handing out copies after mass,  not protesting against it.  The only people in the film who are presented  in a  relentlessly negative way are anti-choice protestors, and whether or  not you approve of that is between you and your conscience.  I know where I  stand.

 | product/productId: 0767828054 | review/userId: A1HCU8WAGUY5EY | review/summary: Who's Kidding Whom? | review/text: Having seen "Five Easy Pieces" when it first came out and again on video long ago when VHS was the rage, I was surprised at how well I remembered it. Not only was the famous whole wheat toast punch line fresh in my mind, but so was the Lesbian hitch-hiker's, "I don't even want to talk about it."  What most reviewers seem to have missed is all the other hilariously funny bits: the ping-pong game with brother Carl - every scene with Carl in it is hilarious; the mannered, typically goofy performance of Lois Smith; the fact that the brothers' middle names are Eroica and Fidelio; the hopelessly out-of-tune  piano in the obsessively musical family's home; and, of course, the bizarre affair between Partita - there's another name for you classical music buffs -  and the patriarch's nurse, a Mr Spicer  -  I guess he was added to liven things up. Almost as good as the humor are the wonderful performances of Ralph Waite as Carl, and Karen Black and Susan Anspach. Best of all are the spectacularly beautiful Puget Sound ferry scenes  -  the film is worth seeing for those alone.  Sure it's depressing, but you'll get over it.

He's not some aged megalomaniacal, larger than life villain like Dr. No, Goldfinger, Samedi or Cananga, he is an equal of Bond's, someone Bond once called his friend. And this makes him the worst kind of adversary Bond could face. He knows Bond, knows his instincts, knows all his moves, and it's fantastic to see Bond matched against a villain who could take him down with words rather than fantastic gadgetry.

Tolstoi would be proud ! | review/text: This is the best DVD edition of Voina i Mir (War and Peace) available. It contains the 'long lost' widescreen footage. It is directed by Sergi Bondarchuk who is the father of Natalya Bondarchuk best known for her role in the original and better version of Solaris.<p>This film was originally released as a serial. Each part made seperately.(kind of like the star wars film but these were made in order) It took a total of 3 years to make. Said to be closer to the book than almost all movies based on books.<p>The pacing may be slow to some due to the length of the film. I consider this to be one of the chronicles of Russian Cinema. I have been interested in Russian culture for a very long time and this is the kind of film that makes me wish I was Russian. <p>On a rainy weekend I could invite my Russian friends over, bring out a samovar filled with Russian Caravan tea, also blini and kvas will go well with it too.<p>It also has subtitles in almost a dozen languages!<p>more like this available from the Russian Cinema Council (Ruscico)<p>If you don't like this kind of film you can still buy it to cure your insomnia.

 | product/productId: 6302281857 | review/userId: A3BSS2M2DPPV4T | review/summary: UNDERRATED | review/text: Ben Hecht wrote, produced and with the excellent cinematographer Lee Garmes, directed this night-life story about a poor clerk (John Qualen) who is going to kill himself if he can't get $3,000, and and a drunken playwright (Thomas Mitchell) who takes him in charge. The playwright thinks that since sharp gamblers always let you win at poker before they trim you & the trick is to leave the game early............ Two young lovers complicated the playwright's plan. Offbeat and ahead of its time, this Hecht production is surely one of the most unheralded fine films ever to come out of Hollywood (I suspect because 1939 was THE greatest year the movies ever knew and there was too much compitition). Columbia mogul Harry Cohn hand-picked the lovely Hayworth (as a call girl!) and the performances by Mitchell (as a marvelous lush) and Fairbanks are captivating ; Hecht's dialogue sparkles with poetic irony. It's an unpredictable Broadway saga on the screen, filmed with a fast pace and panache. Hecht's character's talk too much, but Hecht was a compulsive gambler himself, and there's a genial, original spirit to this movie.

I am an English teacher and in the spring I teach Julius Caesar at least four or five times a day, and have done so for the past eleven years.  I've had two or three copies of the movie because the video wore out with all the rewinding, etc... from when we watched the scenes after reading them.  Now with a DVD I don't have to worry about the tape wearing out, and I can enjoy the movie for years to come!  Thank you!

The word of God is always alive, reading it, play-acting it, is always beneficial.  My only comment is, who came Luke did not heal the girl Jesus way, I am sure as an inspired writer and disciple, he too has the gift of healing.(or is the writer and director saying, that the gifts past away with the apostles?)  Anyway the boat trip is not in ACTS, it only provided the background of the location of Luke. Using the Jesus of the "Matthew" movie is good, it provides continuity to ACTS.  The movie as contained in ACTS is super.<br /><br />Jehu C. Sebastian

Even with the international shipping it is still much, much cheaper on Amazon UK.

But it doesn't seem like it when watching. Every element that made Punisher so unique on the comic book pages is gone. The character has  simply been turned into just another maniac with a big gun. Although filled  with good action scenes, comic book fans are advised to skip this one.

An excellent film! | review/text: Having read the reviews but never having heard of this film I expected another over-rated B-grade throwaway but was astounded to find that the five star reviews are spot-on.  Excellent in every respect.  The only way this film could have been better was if it had gotten all the permissions necessary to make a more faithful and accurate docu-drama.  Given that the names have been changed, this film is an astounding accomplishment.  The best that can be said is that my wife, who doesn't swim and who only likes sailing when the engine is running, there's no wind, and the water is perfectly flat, loved this movie, not only for the romance story but for the excitement of the sailing action as well.

You get to see some raw footage inside the studio and watch the songs on the album come to life. Being able to see the songs in their infancy and see all the discussion, arguing, trial and error, and hard work that goes into the finsihed product was amazing. It gives you a new respect for the talent and creativity of all the band members. If you do not consider yourself a serious Aerosmith fan, this is not a video for you. It is not a concert, compilation of music videos, or history of the band. It is simply the making of pump, and something a true Aerosmith fan will enjoy.

The story line is absolutely ridiculous.  When the movie finally reaches it's climax, you pray it's over, yet the movie still gives  you 1 1/2 hours of boredom.  The ending was terrible and the movie really  didn't give you anyone you could relate to or care for.  The only bright  spot was the lovable antics of Bill the Mule.  Unfortunately, Bill the Mule  gets ousted relatively early leaving the rest of the movie in a downward  spiral. Forget this movie!

Mike Judge is the master of stereotypes, and exhibits this skill throughout the BNB days.  The "No Laughing" segment is hilarious with the in-your-face teaching style of Mr. Buzzcut, and "Manners Suck" is phenomenal when the always mellow hippy Mr. Van Driessen attacks classroom guest Mr. Manners when Beavis accuses him of abuse.  "You touch my students and I'll touch you!"  The fun continues when the boys go to prison to be "Scared Straight" and have a blast rocking out Iron Maiden with two thugs they think are cool.  And of course the potential  for moronity is boundless when Beavis assumes his Cornholio persona and disrupts the school day at Highland High.  Buy this now or you have no bunghole!

 | product/productId: 5554465056 | review/userId: A3VEQL1MQ0KNRJ | review/summary: Et Tu, Liz? | review/text: ATTENTION! If you love Liz Taylor, just because you love her, or whatever, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. The same applies if you love 60's genre movies that you regard as "Classics".<br /><br />My "reviews" are tongue in cheek.......I think Elizabeth Taylor was once one the most beautiful women in the world. She did not deserve the Oscar for "Butterfield 8" (she said so HERSELF), but she did derserve it for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and a few other movies, too. She's NOT a "terrible actress". That would be J.LO. Liz is a legend, it's a fact, so please, take this HUMOR (albiet dark humor) review with a grain of salt, OK? And please, I am a PUBLISHED HUMOR WRITER! I "wrote" this review after sending it in e mail form to several friends. They ALL said I should post it on Amazon. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NASTY MINDED PEOPLE WHO THINK I AM MEAN, and took every word I wrote LITERALLY! People, PLEASE!!!!!I'm not mean! And by the by, who-EVER thought this movie deserves FIVE STARS does (and I am not kidding) belongs in a loony bin. It's really pretty bad, and that's no joke!<br /><br />Look at the HBO series "ROME" if you want to see what it was REALLY LIKE, and note to a certain OTHER "REVIEWER", read your HISTORY. CLEOPATRA NEVER SET FOOT IN ROME. EVER. And Octavian (later Augustus Caesar, the FIRST Ruler of Rome) ruled Rome for over FOUR DECADES, and he wasn't a silly swishy mealy mouthed jerk as he is portrayed in this movie. He was clever, wise, and he was a FINE RULER OF ROME, and he took NO PLEASURE in the fact that Marc Antony choose to fight him. And he NEVER GOT SEASICK and said "Wah", I don't like to fight SEA BATTLES". That part of this movie DID make me angry, as it was COMPLETELY HISTORICALLY INACCURATE. ELIZABETH TAYLOR WAS TOO OLD TO PLAY CLEOPATRA. Cleopatra was a YOUNG, GREEK TEENAGER who wasn't that pretty. OK? OK!<br />Well, if you want to know ANYTHING about Roman History, Egyptian History, Greek History, do NOT watch this movie. Actually, there are MANY reasons not to watch this movie, the first reason being, it's TERRIBLE.<br /><br />Made in the early sixties, this movie created SUCH a buzz!<br />I don't remember what I thought about it then. (I was pretty young..like, too young to be watching this movie)....<br /><br />So, when Turner Movie Classics decided to show this movie in UNCUT form, (it was three hours, uncut, it was four and a half hours, two hours would have been sufficient with this cast and script).......my husband and I were caught unaware that we were about to watch ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVIES EVER MADE.<br />And we watched the WHOLE THING<br /><br />The cast is stellar, but they are almost ALL miscast!<br /><br />Eddie Fisher, one of Liz's many husbands, was promised a role as a Palm Tree, and he took it. He did a GREAT JOB!<br /><br />So, filming began in London, directors were hired and fired, and here's a thought, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO FILM A MOVIE ABOUT ROME OR EGYPT, which is SUNNY AND DRY, in LONDON?<br />Um, isn't it RAINY there? Yes! So production was shut down, Liz got Pneumonia and almost died, held up production, they decided to start again in Rome, and here we go.<br /><br />Richard Burton was cast as the dashingly handsome Marc Antony, beloved General and most trusted friend of Julius Caesar, played by "My Fair Lady's" Rex Harrison, who, after reading the script, pronounced "I can read sh**ty dialog with the best of them," plus, he needed the dough.<br /><br />Not to sound like an idiot, but duh, ELIZABETH TAYLOR, who was thirty-six years old, was cast as the nubile young temptress, Cleopatra. OK. That's just wrong right there. Liz was too old, I don't care how "pretty her face was". Thirty-six is NOT old, it was just WAY too old to play Cleopatra, who was about 14 years old. Cleopatra was Greek actually, olive skinned, and not particularly beautiful, but quite wily and smart and had a way with sexual things that I wish she had passed down!<br /><br />So, Caesar is in Egypt, because, he has fought a seven year civil war against Pompey Magnus, and also, Caesar needs Egyptian stuff, like all their gold, and wheat, and gildings and marble and granite, and all their stuff, and I mean, ALL of it!!! Every bit! Cleopatra had already had her brother killed, but in the movie, it makes it seem like her snotty brother is still around and trying to kill Cleopatra. He is played by some guy who I am sure is residing on the "where are they now list", and all he said was, "I don't LIKE my sister! I want to be King. Give me the Kingdom, I want to be King. Hmmph!" Really. He said that. While wearing a giant Egypt type headpiece that had a golden snake that went almost in between his eyes that made him look like a cross eyed idiot. Which I think he was.<br /><br />So, taking a bit from history and a bit from Shakespeare and a bit from various Villiage Idiots, the Script has that puffed up booze addled Elizabeth Taylor, who was weighing in at about a buck fifty-five then, (you know how Liz has "battled the buldge)" brought to Caesar, while he is staying in the Egyptian Palace, and she has herself wrapped up in an Oriental Rug.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want the job of carrying that tub of lard in a HEAVY Oriental Carpet, and apparently, no one else did either, because it's clear when the man walks in, ELIZABETH TAYLOR is not in that carpet. If she HAD been it would be like an Anaconda after it eats a sheep or something. YOU'D HAVE SEEN HER.<br /><br />So, fiction continues, and out rolls Liz, and rolls and rolls, with her Cleopatra wig on and a DRESS THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FOR THE 1961 PROM, because correct me if I am WRONG, but didn't women back then wear robes and gowns that were gauzy and flowing, and had empire waists, or one shouldered outfits? Look at the history books! They didn't WEAR GIRDLES, and nipped in the waist gowns, but then again, they WEREN'T Elizabeth Taylor, who needed a GIRDLE really BADLY!<br /><br />Her fat white arms distracted me as much as her NASAL and IRRITATING VOICE, and she never SHUT HER MOUTH. Elizabeth Taylor is NOT a great actress. She COULD be good, but not in this movie. The end. Richard Burton always said that about her, and he was right.<br /><br />So, Rex Harrison, as Caesar, looks at Cleopatra, and exclaims how BEAUTIFUL she is (that was written in Liz's contract, she HAD to be called beautiful at least seventeen times OR ELSE)......and HOW YOUNG she is. OK. At WHOM is he looking? The ONLY person I think would be qualified to play Cleopatra now would be a young "Prince," but not be funky. Really. Cleopatra was tiny and dark and kind of average looking but had kinky sex tricks that just made men weak in the knees, and all that.<br /><br />In one bit of hilarious dialogue, Rex Harrison is talking about the great Alexander (the one played by Colin Farrell in that GOD AWFUL MOVIE), and saying "Alexander was YOUNG when he started his campaigns, and you are even younger! You are but a girl!"<br />No she's not! She's a thirty-six year old somewhat tubby temptress who peaked at age thirty-two and has rolls of flab on her belly. THAT would be like telling Phyllis Diller she looked like Britney Spears!<br /><br />Anyway, Cleopatra's Brother is killed, Cleo gets to be queen, she has sex with Caesar, as Caesar is married to the barren and ugly Calpernia, who is back in Rome, and SO IT'S SAID that Cleo bore him a "MALE CHILD," which, as we all know, is WAY better than a "FEMALE CHILD."<br /><br />Caesar returns to Rome, but not before fighting for TWO YEARS in various places and conquering pesky people who do NOT want to be part of Rome, and when he comes back, he declares he wants to be Emperor of Rome, and Brutus and Cassius and the gang at the Senate don't like that, so they stab him to death in the Senate Halls, and scurry away, because people of Rome DO NOT like that they did that.<br /><br />So, Marc Antony starts to hunt them all down, and meanders around Cleopatra's way, and BOOM! He falls for her RIGHT AWAY! He ALSO needed Egypt's money and Ports and grain and you name it, but he was REALLY SMITTEN with Cleo!<br /><br />Back home in Rome, Octavian (Julius Caesar's great Nephew, and later, his ADOPTED SON) is appointed as part of the Triumvirate of Rome, which includes Marc Antony, Octavian (later to become Augustus Caesar, one of the BEST and GREATEST Rulers of Rome) who is played by, get this, RODDY MCDOWELL, of "Lassie Come Home" and "National Velvet" fame. PROBABLY the worst bit of casting, as they make Octavian to be a simpy, girlish, mean spirited know-nothing. WRONG.  Carroll O'Conner was cast as a ROMAN SENATOR (I think I heard him mutter "meathead" as he stabbed Julius Caesar).............and Martin Landau as a Centurion, which, I guess I can KIND OF imagine, MAYBE, and HUME CRONYN as an EGYPTIAN GUY who is close to Cleopatra. HUME CRONYN? EGYPTIAN? WHAT?<br /><br />So, when Antony sees Cleopatra again, after he had returned from Rome to marry Octavian's sister, Octavia, for Political reasons, Richard Burton has to look at Elizabeth Taylor and say "Eet has bean three YEAHS, how is it possible that you are even MORE beauteeful than BEFOH"?<br />Point: It isn't.<br /><br />Great scene: Marc Antony walks up when Cleopatra is taking a bath in a giant tub, with CHLORINE in it to hide her FLAB, and she has TOY ships in the tub (think Francis in "Pee Wee's Big Adventure)....and remarks on her incredible beauty once again, because it's in the script, and he wants to say his lines really fast because he needs a drink.<br /><br />My husband said that Richard Burton spoke in Staccato bursts....how can I write this? Like this perhaps: Burton:"YOUhaveNOTgivenmeREAsonTOSTAYHENCEImustgo." Like that.<br />IN the giant scene where Cleopatra enters Rome with her son, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED she has a fine show............she arrives on a mini-Pyramid with her son at her side, and the only black people in this whole movie were "fine Nubian Warriors and Dancing Maidens", who kind of looked like they were doing the Funky Chicken in the wrong time period costumes........and strictly for the white people's amazement and entertainment.<br /><br />They had one or two pathetic "battle" scenes, and I swear, we were laughing SO HARD as that drunken stick armed Richard Burton tried to pretend he could SWORD FIGHT, it was like he grabbed a play sword and was going "Wheeeeeeeeeeahhhhhhh!" Ummph" "Weeeyahhhhhh!".....like a little kid pretending he could do something, and of course, great big guys had to throw themSELVES backwards as if the great Marc Antony had actually HIT them................<br /><br />As we grew giddier, every time Richard Burton walked in the room, all we said was "I need a drink," or, "Perhaps we should settle this over a drink," or "I had too much to drink last night, perhaps another drink would help."<br /><br />As he CRAWLED over a fake boat side, (the crew of the movie had lifted a STUNT GUY, I am SURE, seen only from the back, on this trapeze like thing, to get him from one boat to the other, as Richard Burton, had he done it himself, would surely have lost his grip and fallen and broken his NECK.)  Then, they would pan to Richard Burton climbing on board, and the lack of MUSCLE TONE and his HIDEOUS WHITE SKIN were hilarious.<br />We were DYING from giddy laughter by then.<br /><br />Plus, after her Cleopatra wig scenes, Elizabeth Taylor wore her hair in a SIXTIES STYLE for a while, which was, IMPOSSIBLE, because Romans AND Greeks and Egyptians either shaved their heads and wore wigs, or wore a cap over their hair and wore wigs.<br />Her VOICE! It was so annoying I don't wonder why the man took to drink even more!<br /><br />Some of her "Handmaidens" were NATURAL BLONDS with BEEHIVE hairdos, and we all know how COMMON that look was in EGYPT.<br /><br />And blah blah blah, as history DOES tell us, Marc Antony DID ally himself with Alexandria in Egypt, and Octavian had NO choice but to go and KICK MARC ANTONY'S ASS, which he did, but Antony was so ashamed he fell on his sword, as she should have, but in the movie, he falls on his sword in CLEOPATRA'S PALACE, which he wasn't IN, during the BATTLE ON THE SEA, and we both said (my husband and I) "OH THANK GOD he is DEAD and will NOW SHUT THE HELL UP". Oh, but he wasn't dead! He "fell on his sword" in a place on his body where I guess there are HARDLY ANY ORGANS OR BLOOD VESSELS, so he could CONTINUE to blather to Cleopatra about I FU**ING DO NOT KNOW WHAT, and if you had a GUN to my head I would not be able to tell you. It was DRIVEL! And we were like...............you know, "The English Patient"...........we were screaming "JUST DIE! DIE ALREADY! SHUT UP AND DIE!!!!!!!!!" And fifteen minutes more of blathering and he did die, and then SHE got to die, along with her sixties hairdo handmaidens, when she picked up a snake in a bowl of figs (I'm SURE while doing the scene she managed to eat about ten figs because she was always starving and wanting chicken or something).............and blathered and blathered and then, THANK GOD for that ASP (it looked like a harmless GARTER SNAKE, which I am sure it was), when it slithered away, but MERCIFULLY FOR US, it killed her quite quickly. In truth, it would have taken about FIFTY deadly ASPS to kill that loud mouthed overrated chunky woman with a pretty face who was pushing forty.<br />If Time Travelers from the past came back and saw that movie, they would slaughter the human race.<br />Oh, and the cost of the movie, while IT DID WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE GOD KNOWS WHY, didn't recoup what it actually cost to make the movie, SUNK the Production Company, and signaled the end, of the "Sand and Sandals" movies for another thirty-eight years, until "Gladiator" reclaimed the genre.<br />And then, other studios had to make "TROY" which sucked, and "Alexander" which sucked more, and "Kingdom of Heaven" which really sucked, so maybe, we won't be seeing epics like "Cleopatra" for a good long time. And I think that might be a GOOD THING..............and wait!<br />ELIZABETH TAYLOR LIVES ON YET! Richard Burton is dead, Rex Harrison is dead, Hume Cronyn is dead, Roddy McDowell is dead, Martin Landau is dead, Carroll O'Conner is dead....................hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm? A DEAL perhaps? We'll never know! People, READ YOUR HISTORY! They got a lot RIGHT in this movie, regarding time periods and names. The portrayals of famous people in history were horrible, and they took WAY TOO much artistic (if you want to call it that) liscence here. Trust me.

I loved 2001 which was a work of genius!  This is in no way connected to the original.  Whoever wrote this should be put to death.  I initially read a comment stating that this was a continuation and was "a thinkers movie".. nope.  If you like to think this will only make you mad.  If you even remotely have an accurate opinion of the meaning behind the first, you'll recognize that there is no connection.. Sorry for the rambling, but I'm pissed!  I only hope I can forget this movie so it doesn't ruin one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />As I did, I'm sure you'll watch anyway.  When you do, please come back and agree. Others need to be saved and no royalty checks need to go out for this abomination.
 | product/productId: 0790742675 | review/userId: A84Z6XUMGRMJ1 | review/summary: "Bewitched" Meets "The Exorcist" | review/text: Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) and sister Gillian (Nicole Kidman) are modern day witches, with real magical powers. Sally is shy and conventional, only wanting to ignore her power, fit into the everyday world and live a normal life. Gillian is the wild child who runs away from home to live life in the fast lane - sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll - until her psycho boyfriend turns mean and she calls on Sally for help.<p>I have to register one major gripe with this film. I mean, it truly drove me nuts. In the opening scene, when the girls' ancestor, witch Maria Owens, is about to be hanged, the noose around her neck isn't even pulled tight. It's about two feet across and, if she'd actually taken the big fall, would've slipped right off her head. Amazing sloppiness on the filmmakers' part. It's hard to get caught up in a movie when, during the very first scene, you're shaking your head and muttering, "What were they THINKING?"<p>The Owens women, thanks to a curse laid by Maria, are doomed to have any man they love die. Sally as a little girl has the perfect solution: she casts a spell wishing for a man with an impossible list of attributes. "He will hear my call a mile away. He will whistle my favorite song. He can ride a pony backwards. He can flip pancakes in the air. He'll be marveously kind. And his favorite shape will be a star." Since such a man can't possibly exist, she'll never be in love, thus never suffer a broken heart. Years later Sally falls in love, not with her dream man but a normal guy, they marry and have two beautiful daughters - then he's run over in the street. Sally, recognizing the curse, concludes she'll never love again. Then one day, up shows Aidan Quinn....<p>Trailers for this film were really misleading. If all you knew about Practical Magic came from them, you'd think it was a bright, happy romantic comedy. While there are certainly elements of that in here, it's actually a weird and not entirely successful blend of comedy, romance and violent, creeped-out horror story.<p>Scenes like Sally kissing her future husband for the first time to the bouncy strains of Faith Hill's "This Kiss" or an entire family of witches, dressed in black Halloween finery, opening their umbrellas on top of a tall house, then jumping off and drifting to the ground Mary Poppins-style, are charming. They make a strange mix, however, with things like Sally bludgeoning a man to death with a frying pan, or Nicole Kidman, possessed by the spirit of that self-same dead man (who happens to be a serial woman killer) running her tongue slooooowly along one of Sandra Bullock's incredible cheekbones and hissing, "I'm feeling VERY into sisters right now." (Got to hand it to Nicole Kidman, she does "possessed" very well. Linda Blair has nothing on this woman. Personally, I'm holding out for a movie where Nicole Kidman plays a vampire. She's already got that pale, bloodless, languid look about her; she only needs a pair of sexy needle point fangs to really rock.)<p>But....I digress.<p>In later scenes, the witch-phobic wives of the town, after decades of despising the Owens women, when called upon by Sally to help in Gillian's exorcism, instantly and cheerfully pitch in. This stretches the suspension of disbelief, to say the least.<p>There are good things here, mostly Sandra Bullock, owner of one of the most beautiful, expressive faces and solid set of acting skills in Hollywood. It's just awfully hard not to like Sally Owens. She's so achingly decent (and looks just like Sandra Bullock, always a positive thing). Sally's been hard used by life, but still tries to hold it all together, be a good mother to her daughters, help Gillian in her time of need, she's ALMOST given up hope she'll ever again find love and happiness. You can't help but root for Sally. She's irresistible.<p>Let's not forget Nicole Kidman, who obviously had a blast making this movie. No one, no matter how good an actress, could sport the evil little grin Gillian has in the "being turned around by two girls while bound to a chair" scene without the actress in question having the time of her life. Gillian is the dark to Sally's light, and for all their differences the bond between the sisters, their very real love, is well presented and quite believable.<p>Practical Magic can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an upbeat, life affirming romantic comedy or a grim, frightening horror movie. By trying to be both at once, it ultimately fails at both. At the same time, though the pieces of the movie don't fit very well, some of the individual pieces are fascinating. This is certainly an interesting failure, compelling in its way. If Practical Magic doesn't totally succeed, it fails while trying to pull off something quite unusual. I'm glad I saw it.

An action packed and well crafted episode.<p>&quot;The  Derelict&quot; takes up where &quot;Stowaway&quot; leaves off and concerns  the Robinson's first encounter with alien life.  Naturally, Dr. Smith has a  hand in making First Contact anything but smoothe.  Well written and nicely  restored to its first broadcast glory.  It also contains incidental music  never used again for the rest of the series.<p>&quot;Island In The  Sky&quot; chronicles the Robinsons Family's crash landing on Preplanis and  shows their pioneer spirit as they adapt to their strange new surroundings.  Complications set in thanks to Dr. Smith.  Here again, Smith is the total  villain and programs the Robot to &quot;eliminate&quot; any unessential  member of the Robinsons should they be found alone.  And guess who's out on  his own trying to repair the Chariot while the Robot is scouting  around...An excellent episode.
 | product/productId: 0784011796 | review/userId: A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q | review/summary: The Calculus of Disbelief | review/text: It is a remarkable surprise that, in a time of science fiction and fantasy films which continually strive do outdo each other in pyrotechnics, one of the best science fiction films I've seen is a little black & white masterpiece that was shot with a $60,000 budget.  Darren Aronofsky, writer and director of 'PI', has created a film that is every bit as engaging as its 'big' brothers - in reality, even more so.<p>Mathematician Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is on a quest.  He is convinced that underlying the chaos of the stock market is a pristine order, a mathematical rule with which he can prove that everything can be reduced to numbers.  His mentor and teacher is Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who was forced to give up his own investigations into PI when he suffered a mysterious stroke.  <p>Cohen's investigation takes him far beyond the gyrations of the stock market into the mystical Kaballah and an intense questioning of the basic nature of reality.  His tool for this journey is the silent, inanimate computer, Euclid, who seems to deconstruct Cohen's universe further with each strike of the return key.  Even when Robeson urges Cohen to take a break from a quest which is clearly destroying the mathematician, torturing him with horrific headaches and hallucinations, Max is unable to stop.  He is drawn step by step into the irrevocable gap between the sacred and the mundane.<p>Made with reversal film which heightens the contrast between light and dark, the film provides a continuous flow of symbolic content which plays in harmony with the world of ideas from with it is drawn.  Ants and electric drills, computer chips and the swirls of cream in a cup of coffee all seem to have otherworldly referents.  Aronofsky and Gullette, by some strange archaic alchemy have managed to create the seeming of layer after layer of possible meaning.  To me the film itself becomes a non-repeating pattern where chaos mimics reality.<p>This film satisfies on many levels, starting with a question, finding an answer, and then discovering the next question.  It is visually brilliant.  Film director Matthew Libatique proves himself a genius, and Matthew Maraffi's production design is amazing.  Euclid is created out of scrap and loose parts, but manages to take on a full life of its own.  The acting is simply perfect.  This is a film for late night coffee house conversations, appealing to both the paranoid and the believer.<p>Notable additional contents of the DVD are two full length commentaries on the film one by Aronofsky and the other by Gullette.  There is a section of outtakes, the film trailers and some other miscellany.  Much recommended.

 | product/productId: 1567301495 | review/userId: A3NGH3DOKQFCWD | review/summary: Read the book for the plot, watch this for beautiful women! | review/text: A young Buddhist scholar rejects the teachings of his master, who advocates complete abstinence from all physical pleasure in order to attain enlightenment, and goes in search of a good time, and soon discovers that  in order to get the girls he desires, he's going to need bigger equipment.  Much bigger equipment in fact. Something that a horse would have. But too  much of a good thing can only lead to trouble, and he eventually finds that  the old monk may not have been full of wind after all. Shallow,  directionless, soft-core, and stupid. A very twisted and just plain daft  interpretation of The Carnal Prayer Mat, the famously-banned `Yellow' novel  by Li Yu. It isn't a yellow novel really; most of those critics entirely  missed the point. But this HK adaption is indeed gratuitous, and really  does seem to be just an excuse to see a lot of very beautiful women gyrate  and moan in revealing clothing, or indeed, no clothing whatsoever. The  moral Buddhist message about animal pleasures fails to make the transition  to the audio/visual medium, along with every other point Li Yu was trying  to make. However, I am a bloke, and I won't pretend that I wasn't  entertained by those beautiful women I mentioned, and when I'm in the mood  I can enjoy the crude and silly humour (and it really is very funny in a  silly way) that characterises this and other such HK films. Just don't go  into this with any expectations of depth. If well-choreographed soft-core  sex is your thing (and let's face it, who doesn't like that?), as portayed  by Chinese goddesses of HK cinema, then what are you waiting for? Sex &amp;  Zen beckons you!
 | product/productId: 6300198286 | review/userId: A2SFZR9WKGJWEU | review/summary: grateful for the superb audio quality on this one | review/text: If you want a great look into the early-mid seventies era of the Dead, you Neeeeed this dvd.  The sound is great. The footage is classic and awesomely typical of the times.  Many consider this period of the dead as somewhat of a pinacle. Their playing was tight and had sincere feeling behind it. The Wake of the Flood ('73) and Mars Hotel ('74) albums were somewhat of a change in their sound, but a good one i'd say.  And, as always, their set stretched back years, to their first albums, and always included great extended jams.<br /><br />This DVD set is all that you hoped it would be. The theatrical relase (disc 1) is an 'enlightening' view into the scene surrounding the dead, with great performances intertwined.  The bonus material (disc 2) contains over and hour and a half of awesome footage of ONLY songs.  And while you can see in some places why this footage was left out (guitars slightly out of tune, and other flubs) it pretty much made the movie for me.  There are very minimal crowd shots and all the great solos are closely documented.<br /><br />You won't even need any outside 'influences' to feel happy watching this one.<br /><br />As it was said earlier, "Get if for Disc 2", if nothing else.
 | product/productId: 0783232063 | review/userId: A37S3ACL57LN62 | review/summary: Great Satire! | review/text: Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is a great spoof on old film noirs. Having Steve Martin in the lead was not enough, though, for Carl Reiner. The very clever idea of using real clips from film noir classics was used. This adds a whole new level of comedy to the film, and the fact that it works makes the film all the more great.<br /><br />Martin is great here as a wise detective (with dark hair!) who always knows what even the silliest of clues means. He finds himself falling in love with the beautiful woman who hired him, a staple in every great thriller. Some of the jokes between the two are immaturely sexual, but the beauty of most of them is that they are discreet enough to pass over a child's head, making this movie suitable for family viewing. Martin's strange behavior and the witty script make for a great combination of old and new styles.<br /><br />Look for cameos from some of the brightest stars of classic Hollywood including Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Veronica Lake, Bette Davis, Lana Turner, Fred MacMurray, James Cagney, Joan Crawford, Charles Laughton, Vincent Price, and many more.
 | product/productId: 1572524448 | review/userId: A25JBPU5G0C29H | review/summary: A classic, heartfelt coming of age story | review/text: In Francois Truffaut's debut, award winning film, he paints visually the pain and joy of childhood, through a semi-autobiographical account of a 13 year old boy living in France. Antoine, lives with his mother and father in an apartment, on minimum finance. He gets into trouble at school, time after time, and at home his parents punish him, but at heart, he is a good kid. He decides to run away, but his parents find him, and they begin to treat him nicer. But when he gets suspended from school, he runs away for good. He begins stealing, and he gets caught. After he stays at a special home for juvenile delinquents, he escapes and his spirit prevails. This story is very moving, and entertaining. You get pulled into the young boy's life, and can relate with him. After you see how he keeps hope and prevails, it creates a warm feeling, and inspires you. The direction is perfect, and the director won the Best Director at Cannes Film Festival. I highly recommend those who wish to watch a fun, entertaining tale of hope and faith in the face of seemingly endless problems. 5 stars.
 | product/productId: 6302158176 | review/userId: AV5G37VFE5NVD | review/summary: An unnecessary conclusion to the GODFATHER saga, but not a bad film | review/text: At the end of the 1980s, Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios was nearly bankrupt.  Zoetrope needed money, and it didn't take a genius to figure out how to get it.  They would make another GODFATHER movie.  And that is how, sixteen years after THE GODFATHER: PART II, we were given THE GODFATHER: PART III.<br /><br />The film begins in 1979.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has finally given up his life of crime and is building a reputation as a respectable philanthropist.  When Victor Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate son of Michael's deceased brother Sonny, asks Michael for work, Michael finds himself drawn in once more to a life of crime.  Cocky gangster Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) starts a gang war while Victor falls in love with Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), deepening Michael's troubles.  As an enraged Michael says, "Just when I thought that I was out, they PULL me back in!"<br /><br />That was the mood of many audiences as well.<br /><br />In defense of the film, THE GODFATHER: PART III is far from a bad movie.  In fact, it's a very good movie.  However, when compared to the first two GODFATHER films - arguably the greatest movies ever made - PART III looks very, very weak.  For the most part, the acting is excellent.  Pacino is very moving.  His performance as Michael in this film closer resembles the younger Michael from THE GODFATHER than the ruthless fiend from THE GODFATHER: PART II.  Andy Garcia as Victor, Michael's young protege, is excellent.  Returning cast members Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are great.  George Hamilton's character is a substitute for Robert Duvall, who couldn't agree to the low paycheck for the film.  Bridget Fonda has a brief, but enjoyable, appearance.  The big flaw in the cast is Sofia Coppola.  Sofia, Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, is now best-known for directing films such as THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION.  As a director, she is very talented; as an actor, she is not so talented.  Sofia is woefully miscast as Michael Corleone's daughter, though Winona Ryder - the original choice for Mary Corleone, who had to pull out at the last minute to perform in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS - would have been miscast as well.<br /><br />Coppola's directing and his script, co-written by GODFATHER author Mario Puzo, is great, but it lacks the power and feeling that it had in the original GODFATHER movies.  Gordon Willis' cinematography, which was magnificent in the original films, isn't half as impressive here, though it has its moments.  The real problem with THE GODFATHER: PART III is that it shouldn't exist.  Though it is an interesting addition to the saga, it was made for money, not because it needed to be made, and to say it pales in comparison to parts I and II is an understatement.  Still, I would recommend seeing it, if only to quell your curiousity, and for the film's ending, which is truly stellar.

 | product/productId: 079284632X | review/userId: AKGFJ3UV4QSM6 | review/summary: It's not as bad as people make it out to be | review/text: The movie is disturbing. I guess thats what it's meant to be because it is in no way shape or form scary. The special effects aren't that great cause it was made in 71, but I Imagine they were decent for the time. I think the abbrupt ending and bad films cuts add to the messed up feel of this movie and make it better, cause the movie is so strange to begin with. I didn't find the killing or rape shocking, just the idea that the 4 criminals did it for the hell of it is kinda sick. and another thing that makes the movie kinda good, is that the parents don't act bloodthirsty or crazy, and all the victims are dead within a 10 or fifteen minute time span, and the parents are so ametuer about trying to kill the people, they barely are able to kill them because they are scared themselves or just not smart. but anyhow, if you bought this to see phenomonal acting and awesome special effect, you bought it for the wrong reason. It is a classic because this was the first movie to do this type of stuff, but I will say this, it's a heck of a lot better than most prissly teen slasher flicks you see today, and I liked this movie better than scream.

 | product/productId: 0792841859 | review/userId: A1NFKE0TNZUGGC | review/summary: A great movie. My favorite film for use of character actors. | review/text: This is a powerful movie. Movies of this genre are bound to receive various political perspectives. But that doesn't lessen the impact of this movie. In many ways you feel Mississippi during the era involved. Not just in the politics and bigotry, but in the countryside presented itself. There are some subtle allusions that assist in creating a feel for the town this movie takes place in. Gene Hackman and William DaFoe are fabulous in their lead roles, as is Frances McDormand. But to me, the real reason to watch this movie is the incomparable collection of character actors, my favorite movie in that category. it's a treasure trove. You can debate the angle of many of the most popular civil rights movies, their message, be it explicit or implied. But the performances by this ensemble cast and the backdrop of Mississippi make this one of the most watchable movies of the genre. From R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt. in "Full Metal Jacket") and Stephen Tobolowski (Needle Nose Ned in "Groundhog Day") - 2 of the most renowned character actors playing the mayor and Clayton Townley, head of the Klan, respectively- to Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker, Gailard Sartain, Pruitt Taylor Vince- all playing loathsome bigots. Tobin Bell will be a familiar face as well in his small role as an FBI agent in the latter part of the film. Even James F. Moore who plays a simple barber with a pittance for dialogue is essential to the feel of this moving film. It's the character actors who steal this show. it's an outstanding film with crystal clear DVD remastering in sound and quality, There are several memorable scenes integral to the story (Hackman's encounter with Frank Bailey at "the club") and naturally the scenes that accompany such a film that stir the audience into righteous outrage. For the purposes of this movie, everything and everybody clicks. There are some gripping behind the scene stories as to the extent actors like the great Stephen Tobolowski went to dig into their roles, making their performances all the more effective and proven on the final print. When I started buying DVDs, this was on the top of my list. It's a steal at the often found bargain price.

It was painful to watch the horrible quality of the added footage. If I am going to deal with flipping sides of a LD, the film better be in perfect shape! At least the DVD is completely crisp and clear with glorious sound and anamorphic picture.

 | product/productId: 0790736233 | review/userId: AMCVSQE2ED78X | review/summary: No. 1 DVD - it doesn't get better than this | review/text: Excellent acting, outstanding directing and a thrilling story combine to produce an absolute masterpice of the science-fiction genre. SF - yes - but they make you believe it could happen exactly like this (and who knows - it  might...). One of the most interesting facets of this movie is the fact  that it has something that is rarely seen in Hollywood: a female heroine!  Jodie foster brilliantly portrais a woman who is strong, intelligent,  driven, courageous but also sensitive and emotional. Easily the strongest  female character since Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Alien&quot;. The DVD is a  showcase in itself: the 5.1 digital sound is clearly the best in over 100  DVDs I've seen, extremely dynamic (if you have a subwoofer: tie it to the  floor for the &quot;liftoff&quot; and journey parts of the movie or else it  will bounce all across your living room), there are wonderful directional  effects aplenty, the dialogues are crisp and easy to understand and the  score is a beauty, too. For me the highlight are the full-length  commentaries of Jodie Foster and director Zemeckis. They offer interesting  and often humorous first hand insight into the making of this great movie.  You learn a great deal about filmmaking (much more than through any  &quot;making-of&quot; featurette), share toughts, feelings, even doubts of  the people who brought this masterpiece to you and even learn about some  memorable human episodes that happened during the shoot. Last but not least  the image quality is very good, the contrast is high, the tonal balance is  beautiful and the sharpness is way above what VHS could ever offer. This  DVD is a true gem - I recommend it to everybody!

This is a great story with some great actors, a kinda hokey-for-today script & definitely dated special effects. Tony Randall is great- losing himself in the characters even if obviously-himself in the various disguises. His Dr Lao is deliberately part offensive-caricature and part perhaps-saint/angel/god.<br /><br />Amazon's pairing of this with SOMETHING WICKED is genius.

Enterprise answers a distress call from a small planet, the landing party is captured by a group of agents from the Kelvan empire, located in the distant Andromeda galaxy. The Kelvans' purpose is to find planets suitable for colonization. However, their own ship was destroyed and now they need the Enterprise to make the 300-year journey home. To utilize the starship, the Kelvans " huge, tentacled creatures " take on human form. After several attempts at escape, Kirk accepts his fate and agrees to let the aliens take over his ship. The Kelvans use their technology to transform all but essential Enterprise personnel into small &quot;cubes&quot; which, unless broken or damaged, can be restored to human beings. <p>Recognizing that the Kelvans, in their new human bodies, are discovering human sensation and emotion, the remaining crew attempts to foster dissent amongst the aliens: Scotty succeeds in gettting one of them drunk, McCoy injects an irritant into another, and Kirk makes romantic overtures to the Kelvan leader's woman. With the Kelvans thus distracted, Kirk and the crew are able to regain control of the ship. <p>Kirk points out to Rojan, the Kelvan leader, that the Kelvans are already becoming less like they were before by encountering the humans. In 300 years, their descendants will be so human-like that they won't be able to live among their people on Kelva. Rojan sees the logic in his argument and sends a robot probe to Kelva, reporting what has happened. Pledging to restore the Enterprise crew, Rojan accepts Kirk's offer that the Enterprise find the Kelvans a Class-M planet to colonize.

Whenever it was on television I was there watching it and never got tired of doing so. James Cagney is brilliant, Joan Leslie lovely and the rest of the cast stellar. It's one of those movies that belong in a time capsule to provide future generations with glimpse of a enthusastic, optismistic America that didn't let anything stand in their way.<br /><br />I hadn't watched this film for possbily 20 years or more until recently seeing it with my daughter. It's still a classic, make no mistake about that but it does seem a bit dated. I couldn't help but wonder what the current generation of young people think of this film? I would imagine a vast number of them just wouldn't "get it'" I hope there's enough out there that do, I don't want to believe we've changed that much.

I am a person very easily moved by human experiences, fictional or real.  This movie did nothing for me.  I couldn't lose myself in their lives.

 | product/productId: 079289975X | review/userId: A2FSHOTV0RNW7Q | review/summary: Heartbreaking! Such is the fate of the poet. | review/text: This film is a poem to the enduring pulse of true love and the complex nature of beauty - at once a flickering flame that draws the eyes and then a source of warmth that melts the heart. Cyrano, the poet extraordinaire who's sword is as sharp and fast as his wit, has carried a torch for the beautiful Roxanne as long as can be remembered, the brightness of which has been hiding in the shadow of a grotesque deformity: a large misshapen nose. "I can never be loved even by the ugliest. My nose precedes me by 15 minutes." Like Cyrano, Roxanne is a Romantic where words are windows into the soul, but she's fallen in love with the handsome young musketeer, Christian, who unbeknownst to her, has not the gift for poetry. And so Cyrano becomes the voice of Christian, thus expressing in letterform the depth of his love for her. Roxanne becomes intoxicated, but is blinded by the external beauty of Christian, and remains ignorant of the fact that as her love has grown, Cyrano is really the object of that love. Such is the fate of the poet! Depardieu as Cyrano gives a moving portrayal that is both heartbreaking and heroic.

I have nearly 50 exercise videos I've purchased over the past 20 years and The Power Step Workout is one of the top 5 I reach for over and over again when I want to feel as though I've had a good workout.  If you don't want a 45 minute workout you can do the warmup and the first or second workouts.  Or mix and match different segments on different days. It's segmented to fit your fitness needs but each segment gradually increases the pace. You don't even need the step although using one provides greater cardiovascular benefit.  The cueing is excellent and the routines easy to learn.  The music is great without being distracting.  I think you'll really feel energized with the small group while you work out.  I think you also will return to this video again and again. Your heart and body will thank you.  Kathy Smith knows how to make a great video.  This video proves why she's one the best in the exercise video business.

When I heard about the uncut version, I decided to check it out see if it was any better. After watching the bloody and brutal uncut version, Return of the Joker had been made all the more entertaining. The Joker's earlier demise was a lot more fitting and appropriate in the uncut version, and the final battle between Bruce Wayne and the Joker was a million times more entertaining than the edited version. Simply put, this is Batman Beyond at its finest. The removal of the cuts make Return of the Joker ... a lot more enjoyable than before and all the more entertaining. <p>This is by far the best incarnation of Batman Beyond and the most throroughly enjoyable movie to date. It greatly surpasses the live action films, the animated series and all the other animated films, INCLUDING the awesome Mask of the Phantasm! <p>Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker is simply awesome. In my opinion it's the finest Batman story ever told. It will please any die-hard Batman fan. Anyone who doesn't like this doesn't deserve to worship the caped crusader! It's just simply fantastic. If you're going to buy this, it HAS to be the uncut version!<p>There's no contest.

It doesn't get any better than Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  If this one doesn't knock your socks off, nothing will.  Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are wonderful and give excellent performances, too.  Once you have seen this movie, you will never forget it.
 | product/productId: 5555391390 | review/userId: AIFNOZKR9WTYI | review/summary: deeply damaging | review/text: I tried to watch this stinker as a means to relax after a long day.  After ten minutes I realized the movie was making me very tense as I was forced to grit my mind against it.  The movie takes obviousness to new levels.  There are developments which are completely implausible, characters which are completely unlikeable... I could go on, but why?  The movie comes off as a bunch of actors trying to seem like mobsters.  And Rene Russo trying to seem hardboiled, saying things like, "I know whatta vig is." and scowling like she's from the bad part of Beverly Hills.  The movie insults your intelligence at every turn, causing you to become cretinized by the act of colluding in it by watching.  This is how a movie like this damages your mind: just to keep watching, you have to relinquish so much discernment that you end up a basket case.  For example, one of the first scenes, which was supposed to be in Miami, is CLEARLY filmed in Santa Monica, with the Esplanade as background.  I guess we should thank the filmmakers for cutting corners... only somehow all this money saved didn't affect the ticket prices.  Strange.

There's the beautiful, young victim (Gwyneth Paltrow), her idiot, clueless husband (Jonathon Schaech), and his insane, psychotic mum (Jessica Lange). Unfortunately, things get a bit too bogged down in the wimpy, soppy, pouty-faced Gwyneth vs. Lange (doing her best southern-fried maniac) snit. I kept waiting for things to spiral out of control, or at least for a murder or two, only to see the story slooowly grind along, up until the "Gotcha!" climax. It was OK, but I can't imagine watching it again...

Owned the VHS tape but never purchased the DVD until now. I think it's a great movie with a great cast. So many good actors in this one and Tom Hanks is first rate with his acting as always. And Ron Howard does great directing and just gets better and better over time. This is true history that I never knew happened even when I was a teenager at the time. I never saw or heard anything about this incident until this movie. It is amazing everything that happened to them and that they made it home at all.<br /><br />Well done movie and story telling. Loved the extras with this. This is a movie well worth purchasing and to have in your collection for viewing in the future. As well as being an historical event. I am so glad I now have the DVD of this wonderful movie. I highly recommend getting this movie.
 | product/productId: 6300184196 | review/userId: AYYOPF6RG019D | review/summary: 400 dollars for lunch??? | review/text: My fellow devotees, what else can be said?  I saw this movie in the theater in 1985 (as a teenager) and have seen it over 100(!) times since then (no exaggeration!).  Needless to say, I know it so well, I don't have to watch it anymore.  It's become part of my consciousness.  Of all the movies with lotsa one liners, THIS IS #1--As another reviewer remarked, no matter how far apart my brother and I drift from one another, and it's become quite far these days, we always have 'Fletch'.  It's practically its own language, and for those of us who 'know it', you can converse with someone else in 'Fletch' without anyone else having a clue about what you're talking about.  My mom is always lost whenever my brother and I 'get into it'...  What's funny is that she laughs at some of it even though she has no clue what the hell we're talking about.  For those who haven't seen it or don't like it, this is the role Chevy Chase was born to play.  Nothing before (no, Caddyshack has its moments, but nothing like this) or after 'Fletch' even comes close (no, not even SNL).  This is the BIBLE for Chevy Chase.  In any genre, in any time period, this is both a masterpiece and a classic.  This is Mt. Everest-----By the way, the sequel sucked, and if Kevin Smith (and Jason Lee) make their own, I hope they're ready to scale some lofty heights...
 | product/productId: 6301977742 | review/userId: A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5 | review/summary: Fare beware! | review/text: 2022 and the future is bleak.  40 million people live in New York City and everything's scarce. A new vegetable based food, Soylent Green, seems to be the solution to the problem.<br /><br />Detective Thorn (Heston) shares his squalid digs with Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson), an old college professor who insists on telling him (in no small part to remind himself as well) how good the world used to be.<br /><br />When Thorn is called out on the murder of a VIP, Simonson, (Cotten) we get quite a different view of life at the top.  Simonson's roommate is an attractive young woman, Shirl (Taylor-Young) who is more or less part of the furnishings of the apartment should the new tenant desire it so.  As Thorn continues to investigate, he realizes that something is very wrong at the Soylent Corporation, where Simonson and many of the top officials were affiliated.<br /><br />The idea for this future dystopic originally came from a sci-fi detective novel by Harry Harrison, which was originally titled "Make Room, Make Room!" Harrison's story was one of the initial genre-benders that newer films like "Blade Runner" sprang from.<br /><br />"Soylent Green" was Edward G. Robinson's last film and his performance as a dying old man was by far the best. While the film is one of the great sci-fi classics, many of the effects are outdated.  The 'hot pink' blood literally jarred me out of the story momentarily.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2009
 | product/productId: 0790740907 | review/userId: AXMVY1CH5125B | review/summary: Rating the disc, not the movie. | review/text: I of course love the first two "Vacation" movies and I always will. So I was excited to see this come out on Blu-Ray. Sadly, this is yet another "cas grab" Blu-Ray that is nothing more than an upconverted DVD in disguise - grainy picture, mediocre sound. You're better off saving a few dollars and getting the DVD instead, as you'll get the exact same home theater experience.

This DVD includes two parts, one on Clara Bow and one on John Gilbert.  Both of these great silent stars didn't make it into the sound era.  I am fascinated with John Gilbert's story, so I wanted to see this.  I've actually seen the entire Hollywood story
 | product/productId: 6302142296 | review/userId: A2E0TJ49NACDBA | review/summary: The movies and extra are fine but... | review/text: This is very tough to rate fairly.<br /><br />The movies are exactly what any BTTF fan expects them to be.  My hubby was thrilled with the extras and seeing it in blu-ray meant he was noticing little details he'd missed before (and he's such a huge fan that we headed off to the "Twin Pines Mall" parking lot before we opened this up, so that's saying something).<br /><br />That said the whole BD Live thing is beyond frustrating.  It was taking forever to load the discs even when our net was at its best, so we turned off BD Live - which improved nothing, then it just whined at us - how dare we turn it off.  I'd love to give this 5 stars given how much this series of movies means to the hubby, but with all of this glitches, I can't.  If you love the series, yes -- you will love the blu-ray quality and the extras, but the BD Live is a pain even if you turn it off it seems to keep trying to worm its way back into your attention and freezes everything up, pause the movie a few seconds too long and it will freeze up,  it's basically a very glitchy set up and was actually the first thing I've had to return to Amazon in the decade or so I've been using them... The second copy was a bit better, but it has also frozen multiple times.  The stars it does get are for the movies, extras, and behind the scenes stuff (5 stars there)... if I were rating it solely on their BD live set up, it'd be 1 star as that was implemented very poorly.

 | product/productId: 0782009972 | review/userId: A1K94LXX833JTT | review/summary: New High Noon 2-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition due out June 10th, 2008! | review/text: Lionsgate has announced a new DVD release of High Noon with new special features.  There is what appears to be a reliable report, though unconfirmed, that it will include a new transfer of the film, restored by Paramount.  The current and older DVDs are only of average video and audio quality.<br /><br />This a true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors.<br /><br />Town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is caught between his new pacifist Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) and a felt duty to face down evil men coming on the noon train to take revenge on him (and presumably cause whatever other trouble they please).  Most of the drama takes place in the lead-up to a climactic battle, as the townspeople choose whether to support Kane with action or to let him stand alone.  Amy too must choose between her spouse and her own moral beliefs.  The tension builds relentlessly as we see clocks ticking towards noon.  The innovative black and white cinematography emphasizes the dramatic points, while the internal drama is captured in Cooper's face.<br /><br />The new DVD features are these:<br /><br />-- "Inside High Noon," a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (see below for more on this)<br />-- "Tex Ritter: A Visit to Carthage, Texas," on the Tex Ritter Museum<br />-- the full performance of "Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'" from the Jimmy Dean TV Show<br /><br />The features carried over from the current release are:<br /><br />-- commentary with Gary Cooper's daughter Maria Cooper Janis, screenwriter Carl Foreman's son Jonathan Foreman, director Fred Zinneman's son Tim Zinnemann and Tex Ritter's son John Ritter<br />-- "The Making of High Noon" featurette<br />-- "Behind High Noon" featurette<br />-- radio broadcast with Tex Ritter<br /><br />Whether the new features will warrant an upgrade is a matter of personal preference, of course.  A 50-minute documentary could be quite interesting, if it's well done.<br /><br />It does sound interesting.  The "new" documentary, actually made a couple years ago but shelved until now, is by film and Gary Cooper expert John Mulholland.  It's expected to cover, among other things, the conflict between Cooper and John Wayne over the participation of the blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman.  Given that the film is intended in part as an allegory of the public's acquiescence in the Red Scare, this will have more than the usual gossipy behind-the-scenes relevance.  It includes interviews with three of the children of the principles who participated in the DVD audio commentary: Cooper's daughter Maria, director Zinneman's son Tim, and Foreman's son Jonathan.  There are also interviews with Grace Kelly's son Prince Albert of Monaco, Western and film historians Brian Garfield, Lee Clark Mitchell, Stephen Prince and Meir Ribalow, and High Noon fan President Bill Clinton.  The narration is by actor Frank Langella.<br /><br />Lack of agreement between Paramount and Lionsgate prevented the earlier release of a restored transfer and the documentary, in case you're wondering why this didn't come out before.<br /><br />(Amazon has a habit of removing or not even accepting outside links, but if you want to read more about this, some of the more interesting tidbits are from a discussion at hometheaterforum.  Just do a web search for "high noon" plus "ultimate collector's edition" or "inside high noon" and such keywords to find the links--easy to find.)<br /><br />A parting note on the ethical side of the film.  While everyone can appreciate the strength of Cooper's character and the contrast to the weakness of others, which is no doubt the intended moral focus, we can wonder why the seemingly parallel choices facing Will and Amy are treated differently, with one portrayed heroically for choosing perceived broader duty over duty to spouse, while the other is seemingly approved in doing the opposite (those who have seen the movie will be able to see how that is).  I'm not sure writer Foreman saw that parallel as I put it here, and maybe there are good reasons to argue they aren't really parallel.  It could be a statement about the limits of pacifism, or it could be a reflection of other cultural mores that Foreman didn't question.  Or it could be largely motivated by the need for a certain kind of ending.  I'm not a film historian, so maybe these questions have already been addressed.  If so, feel free to leave a comment about it.
 | product/productId: 6301640586 | review/userId: A3OQ2BR2G9262C | review/summary: Never laughed so hard | review/text: This movie is, quite frankly, absolutely appalling. It is also, however, possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Like most of the other reviewers, I watched it simply because I'm a Dylan fan, and it's only because of the fact that I enjoyed it as much as I did. Dylan's ludicrous performance is so breathtakingly bad that it achieves a rare kind of...genius? perfection? I'm not sure how to describe it. But no matter how bad Dylan is, he is nevertheless by far the best part of this stupefyingly bad film (apart from Rupert Everett's terrifying mullet, that is). Skinny-dipping with Fiona, taunting an audience in England, punching out 'handsome' Rupert (in what is the best/worst ever punch in cinematic history - I must have rewound it 20 times) and languidly trashing a hotel room, Dylan is all over the shop, seemingly so bored he doesn't know where to look. Then, right at the end, after the blind girl pulls a gun on Rupert (don't ask) and Fiona 'rocks' her hometown (joined onstage, of course, by Dylan, who throws a cigarette at her), Bob performs a fragment of an incredibly obscure little gem, something I've never heard or heard of before and which alone justified sitting through the rest of this turgid movie. All in all, 'Hearts of Fire' is worthwhile if you're a Dylan fan, if only to see your idol brought down so low. And to have a good laugh.

 | product/productId: 6301590740 | review/userId: A2VP7JOT3K7PFM | review/summary: Take a chance on being there with...Chance | review/text: +++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the 1970 novel "Being There" by Jerzy Kosinski (who also wrote the screenplay for this movie).  It's a movie that probably will not appeal to everyone's taste.<br /><br />The comedy-drama is about a man named Chance (Peter Sellers), the gardener of a small estate that he has lived and worked on all his life.  (In fact, he has never left the estate because all his needs, even meals, were provided for.)  When the owner (the "old man") of the estate dies, the truthful, well groomed, well dressed but illiterate Chance is evicted.<br /><br />Chance knows only about three things: gardening, watching television, and the environment of the estate where he lived and worked.  That's it!!<br /><br />By chance, he becomes involved with a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley MacLaine).  The billionaire is also an economic advisor to the US president (Jack Warden).  Everything that Chance says is misinterpreted as profound and "sage wisdom."  (Even his name is misinterpreted as "Chauncey Gardiner.")  The billionaire's wife becomes interested in him romantically.  By the end of the story, Chance is considered to be the next president.<br /><br />To get an understanding of how Chance or Chauncey is misinterpreted, consider this dialogue between him and a worker at a publishing house.  (Notice that Chance is absolutely truthful in this conversation):<br /><br />WORKER: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you would consider writing a book for us, something about your political philosophy.  What do you say?<br />CHANCE: I can't write.<br />WORKER: Heh, heh, of course not, who can nowadays?  Listen, I have trouble writing a postcard to my children.  Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.  I'll provide you with the very best ghost-writer, proof readers...<br />CHANCE: I can't read.<br />WORKER: Of course you can't!  No one has the time!  We glance at things, we watch television...<br />CHANCE: I like watching TV.<br />WORKER: Oh, sure you do.  No one reads!<br /><br />The very ending of this movie has Chance walking on water.  Actually, he's walking on the surface of a lake and he reveals to us that the lake has depth not just a surface.  This ending is open to many interpretations but for me it summarized the entire movie beautifully.<br /><br />Sellers gives a superb, subtle comic performance.  This was truly the last great movie Sellers made.  All supporting actors (especially MacLaine and Douglas who won an Oscar for his performance) do terrific jobs.<br /><br />The music is said to be by Johnny Mandel.  I think this means he's just performing it because the main music seems to be that of composer Eric Satie, who wrote beautiful, non-complex music.  The music in this movie adds to each scene.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this movie was when the end credits rolled.  Comical outtakes are shown.  These are hilarious but I feel that these broke the mood of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.  Unfortunately, it has minimal extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great movie that will probably not appeal to everyone's taste.  In my opinion, this movie serves as a tribute to the comic genius of Peter Sellers!!<br /><br />(1979;  2 hr 10 min:  widescreen;  36 scenes)<br /><br />+++++
 | product/productId: 0790731231 | review/userId: A22IE18GWB5A7O | review/summary: The Quintessential Gangster Film | review/text: Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a long movie that feels short, thanks to memorable characters, a blazing soundtrack, and expert pacing that only the director is capable of pulling off. The screenplay is so good, that watching episodes of the Sopranos evoke great memories of this film. In fact, any Italian mafia flick that came out after Goodfellas borrows (or steals) at least a little bit from Scorsese and Pileggi. Ray Liotta's narration is perfect. It is as good as Dreyfuss' wonderul narration in &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and is peppered with comedy, poignant emotion, and heart. <p>&quot;Goodfellas&quot; practically made Pesci's career with his explosive performance as Tommy DeVito. Here, Pesci forever silences the theory that short, little guys can't be tough. Robert DeNiro shines equally as the Irishman Jimmy Conway with his famous &quot;Little Bit&quot; scene. <p>The supporting cast of characters is top notch in the tradition of Scorsese with Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Frank Vincent creating memorable performances. If you haven't seen Goodfellas, buy it! It changed the way Gangster films were made, as it added a little comedy to the gritty criminal subject matter.

 | product/productId: 1572526416 | review/userId: A3R324C4OITNR7 | review/summary: A ROAD TRIP TO THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE BLUES | review/text: I've been a big fan of the work of the late great blues historian/folklorist, Robert Palmer, for sometime now. His book, DEEP BLUES, is generally regarded as the definitive reference on the Delta  tradition... and rightly so (needless to say, if you don't have it... get  it). What a treat to finally get a chance to meet the guy... albeit, on my  TV screen.<p>In this eponymous documentary, Palmer assumes the role of the  proverbial veteran &quot;tour guide,&quot; casually offering us expert  commentary, laced with entertaining anecdotes and served up with dry  Southern wit. While we do hear and see a great deal of Palmer, the film  never loses its main focus-- the blues and the musicians who keep this  important element of American musical heritage alive and kicking. Each of  the featured artists performs one or two songs in their entirety-- in sharp  contrast to so many other music documentaries, which par down their musical  selections to excerpted sound bites to make room for talk, talk and more  talk. <p>Here we find everything from down-home guitars and mouth harps  being played on farm house porches to full bands--influnced by the modern  Chicago-style, yet still distinctly &quot;Pure Delta&quot;--playing in  dark, smoke-filled juke joints. True to the blues tradition, the music is  hot and sweaty. You can't watch this film and sit still--you gotta shake  something.  Highlights: cane fife player Napoleon Strickland (you  can hear more of this wonderful pre-blues tradition on TRAVELING THROUGH  THE JUNGLE: NEGRO FIFE AND DRUM MUSIC FROM THE DEEP SOUTH, an album on the  TESTAMENT label, and several ARHOOLIE compilations); the totally stylin'  Jessie Mae Hemphill (granddaughter of Blind Sid Hemphill, the pre-blues  style fiddler/quills [panpipes] player documented in the Lomax field  recordings); harp player Bud Spires telling a folktale about the devil,  accompanied by Jack Owen's soulful guitar picking in the cranky,  individualistic Bentonia style, popularized by the early bluesman, Skip  James; and Lonnie Pitchford's intense singing as he accompanies himself on  the diddley bow (a raised metal string nailed to the side of a house, which  you pluck with a plectrum and note with a slide).

 | product/productId: 0790750627 | review/userId: A2F7UCDYPS7YBA | review/summary: A case of mistaken identity | review/text: Perhaps Hitchcock's most acclaimed work, "North by Northwest" is an entertaining adventure of espionage, mistaken identity, and a typical 50's romance.  Cary Grant plays the unpresuming Roger Thornhill, and advertising executive who inadvertently gets sucked into a ring of spies who believe he is a man named George Kaplan.<p>Not knowing who Kaplan is, Thornhill tries to escape the spies and find out the truth.  In doing so, he is framed for murder, and his flight across the country begins!  On his way, he meets the mysterious Eve Kendall (played exquisitely by Eva Marie Saint), a glamorous blond who tries to set Thornhill up and then falls for him.<p>The entire story is one big chase, leading to the infamous "face-off" on scenic Mount Rushmore.  The story by Lehmann and the direction by Hitchcock make this movie a true masterpiece.  The DVD features an interesting commentary, theatrical trailer, and featurette about the making of "North by Northwest" hosted by Eva Marie Saint herself.  <p>If you see no other Hitchcock movie, see this one!  They truly don't make ones like this anymore.

This ties in with the story since we can see the mysterious hand of fate working behind the scenes and far beyond human comprehension.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this movie was the song they play during the closing credits.

It is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen.  The characters are easy to love and the plot is just clever enough to make you keep coming back for more.  This is definitely a movie that deserves a re-release on DVD.
 | product/productId: 157330686X | review/userId: A3L19DDI0XHLLW | review/summary: Huh huh... uhhh... hey Beavis, this DVD RULES! | review/text: It is true that the amusing music video segments are missing from this dvd, but this is the only true Beavis and Butthead episode dvd that has been released.  It has several good episodes, and is a nice addition to the collection for nostalgic purposes.  One thing I find particularly annoying regarding this dvd, however, is that it is difficult to navigate and find the menu option.  That is, if there is a menu option at all.  Similar issues abound with the Christmas dvd.  By and large, however, this is Beavis and Butthead, and probably the last true example we'll get on dvd. :(  Perhaps if the sales of this DVD pick up, the MTV empire will release the locks on the gates holding back more B&amp;B dvds from being released.
 | product/productId: 0783225989 | review/userId: A1VCPMT1RRS7K0 | review/summary: One shot is what it's all about | review/text: This is a stirring film. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken are both outstanding - this movie would not have been half as entertaining without them.<br /><br />From the beginning, you get a sense of the lives of these young men.  They are free and fun-loving - and yet everything is about to change for them.  They are proud to serve their country, but they are about to be exposed to a side of life that no one should ever have to see.<br /><br />The scenes set in Vietnam during the war are truly intense and shocking. After the horrors these men witness, you are not surprised to see them become disenchanted and distant. How do you return to a functioning society after being immersed in war and death of the most horrific kind? It seems, tragically, that most simpy can't readjust... and who the hell can blame them?<br /><br />This movie doesn't tackle the war as a whole.  Instead, it shows you a very concentrated story involving only a few men. You see their experiences in Vietnam and the eventual playing out of their individual fates.  It's very disturbing to see Nick (Walken) alive after all that time when Michael (De Niro) returns to Saigon and finally finds him.  He's a shell of his former self, with lifeless eyes and an empty soul - thanks solely to the war.<br /><br />Again, without Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, this movie wouldn't be half as good.  Their performances are excellent.

It holds up to repeated viewing and I should know, because I've been watching it repeatedly since I bought it around ten years ago.  You can just go on and on about the mountainous high points this film has, from Harry Dean Stanton, the western style camera work Alex Cox would later revisit in Straight to Hell, the crackpot philosophizing, the nonsensical alien conspiracy and ensuing government conspiracy, Rev. Larry, the cartoonish punk thugs, seedy Los Angeles, and some other little things like the dialogues ("I installed two ways mirrors in his place in Brentwood"), acting (everyone essentially "disappears into their character"- even the guy from Conan the Destroyer), and the plot.

 | product/productId: 6301334175 | review/userId: A5C9651MPOLK2 | review/summary: Excellent show, poor editing | review/text: (This refers to the VHS edition.)  This show was an incredible multimedia-event; unfortunately, you can't see most of it on this concert video!<br /><br />It was shot beautifully on film, yet has the '80s editing-style of an edit every second, and sometimes blends several angles on the screen at once so that it's hard to tell what's going on.  The real crime is you can barely see the 4 cool "UFOs" that were flying around above the band during the whole show...because that would require a single, unmoving shot of the stage for maybe 10 seconds.  (To Wayne's credit, he did put in two time-lapses showing the giant lighting rigs moving around...but even those go by so fast they're easy to miss!)<br /><br />There are some great shots however, especially the side view of "Mr. Screen" during "Signs Of Life".  But this video unfortunately doesn't do the show justice.  It easily COULD do the show justice, if it were simply re-edited.  Mr. Isham is normally a great director so I hope he will re-edit this before releasing it on DVD.
 | product/productId: 6300215695 | review/userId: A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO | review/summary: A kind of remake of Holiday Inn;and they get it right! | review/text: White Christmas,released Oct./54,was the first to use the Vista-Vision film process.This entailed using about twice the actual film space than ordinary film and the resultant prints,it was thought,would appear more vibrant and clear.The print used here is definitely wonderful;more on that later.<br />The plot of White Christmas is a kind of remake of Holiday Inn(/42)with Bing and Astaire starring then.Unlike Holiday Inn though,this time around they got it right.Holiday Inn had a complicated and ponderous plot going all over the map and never in the end really satisfied.In White Christmas,even though the plot is almost see through,its' solid cast of players,its' numbers and inherent pleasant sensibility make it most entertaining to watch.Bing in Holiday Inn seemed a little on the stiff side but here he's as cool as a cucumber in mannerisms and in his delivery of his lines,in that inimitable relaxed Crosby style.<br />The story opens during WW2 and two entertainers Bob Wallace(Crosby)and Phil Davis(Kaye)with the Army 151st Division,are entertaining their comrades.Bob is a captain and in civilian life was a big name singer,while Phil is a Private First class who assists Bob with music and even in his act.During an air raid Phil rescues Bob from being hurt by a falling wall.While convalescing Phil asks if after the war they don't become a team.Bob balks but Phil starts using his heroic deed of saving Bob's life to persuade him to do it.(This old "wound" would be something Phil would use off and on throughout their relationship whenever he wanted something).<br />The war ends and Wallace and Davis actually become the hottest thing on the Great White Way and in the entertainment business in general.While in Florida they receive a telegram from an ex-army buddy asking if they wouldn't mind checking out the act of his sisters Betty(Rosemary Clooney)and Judy(Vera-Ellen).This they do and they are quite impressed.Judy and Phil hit it off right away but Betty isn't too impressed with Bob.In fact she reveals it was her sister that wrote the letter they received.Before the sisters can finish out the night their landlord has come with the Sheriff to collect some rent from them.Phil,unbeknownst to Bob,gives the girls their train tickets and they make their escape.<br />Later on the train heading to New York and beyond Bob is flabbergasted that Phil hasn't got the train tickets and that they have had to shell out $95 more to get on the train.Eventually the truth comes out and the girls thank both of them for their generosity(Bob is seething)and tell them they are heading to a place called Pine Grove,Vermont for their next gig.Phil persuades Bob to go along and they all head off for "snowy" Vermont.<br />Upon arrival there is no snow and it seems the Inn they are scheduled to play in is doing horrendous business(due to the lack of the white stuff) and they can't afford to pay them full salary.The owner walks in and it is none other than their former commanding officer Major General Waverly(Dean Jagger).He indeed confirms the lack of business but he insists to see the act and pay them in full.<br />Phil and Bob are heart broken for the General and his circumstances and it is decided to bring the entire cast of their Broadway show up to Vermont to perform.To get some publicity he enlists the help of a popular New York variety show host to plug it.The conversation is overheard by one of the staff who mistakenly come away thinking he is going to exploit the General by playing up the down and out angle.Of course it's horse manure but Betty gets wind of this and quits the show,returning to New York.<br />Bob goes on the show as scheduled and Betty watches.Realizing she was mistaken she rushes back to Vermont to rejoin the cast on Christmas Eve.It's a great reunion;the general's place is saved and Phil and Judy and Bob and Betty declare their love for each other.The film ends with the refrains of White Christmas.<br />This films grabs its' groove early on and sticks with it pretty much throughout the picture.The plot as I mentioned is the old boy meets girl,loses girl and gets her in the end thing,coupled with we gotta sing and dance to save the day thrown in for good measure.It's been there,done that and have the tee shirt time,but with a few twists and turns and the solid cast it comes out a winner.Also mentioned was that Bing was in fine form here both in acting and singing.His cool and relaxed demeanour really sold a good part of the film.Danny Kaye was quite a talent and he is in fine singing,dancing and acting form also.Rosemary Clooney in the best movie of her career shows off her abundant talent in both the acting and singing department.She showed alot of acting chutzpah and never let anyone get the better of her in a scene.Vera Ellen was,well,Vera Ellen.Looking positively anorexic she had enough talent to execute her dance routines well but her frequent camera looks are bothersome.For example,at one point Kaye and Ellen go into what one could easily consider,in style anyways,an Astaire/Rogers routine in the "The best Things happen While you're Dancing" number.Unlike Rogers who rarely if ever looked into the camera while dancing,Ellen is too frequently looking at us as if to say"Aren't I doing Well?".It spoils this and every other routine she executes,no matter how competently she does them.<br />In the technical department the print used here is a very good one.There are some areas which could use a cleaning up but generally it is quite crisp and clear and the producers succeeded in giving their movie lots and lots of colours,which come through vibrantly.The film is in its' original a/r of 2:35:1.This is the two disc "Holiday Edition" and it comes in a two one sided disc set,in a keepcase.Housing the keepcase is a clear and silver lined plastic cover.The inside front of it sports a picture from the film of its main stars and in front of that there is a flat clear bag of plastic shavings simulating snow flakes.In addition there are eight 4"X6" repro lobby cards enclosed.Extra features include:commentary by Clooney,backstage stories,a short on Clooneys Kentucky home,a short on Bing and Danny Kaye,a short on Irving Berlin and the music for the film,the stage production of the film,two theatrical trailers and a look back at the movie with Clooney herself.<br />All in all a good holiday themed movie and its' stars are in top form.Never mind the plot just go with the flow and enjoy the high production values,the production numbers,the great Berlin music,the wonderful clarity of the picture and above all the good on screen chemistry of its stars.Recommended.

This movie was excellent. I really enjoyed it. I wasn't too thrilled with Rupert Everett's performance, but Madonna's performance was spectacular, as usual.<p>  Madonna plays Abbie Reynolds, a yoga instructer, whose boyfriend has just left her. She goes to her best friend, Robert (played by Rupert Everett) for a way to get over this. One night, the two become lovers. Abbie then finds out that she's pregnant, and Robert is the father. But Robert is also... gay. Seven years later, while getting ready to do a yoga class, Abbie meets Ben, a charming guy who is very interested in Abbie. The two begin dating. Ben decides that he wants to marry Abbie and it makes Robert furious because he does not want anyone taking his place as Sam's father.<p>  If any one of you took the advice from the one's who said that this movie sucked, give that advice back. This movie did not suck. It has a real good storyline and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy.
 | product/productId: 0800198395 | review/userId: A2PN62S0L13TD | review/summary: Wonderful and weird. | review/text: This is such a great, great, great film. It succeeds on so many levels and this new directors cut is the best presentation of this film yet. Many scenes are restored to the film that I think add nicely to the build up and some have been removed that add to the mystery at the end, such as not showing us the inside of the ship from  Richard Dreyfuss's perspective. Also the use of Devils Tower, a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick's 2001. It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections, they even have their own flag. Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible. Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication, descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament. Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars. But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens, as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David. A deeper film than many believe and overall a beautiful DVD transfer with incredible sound.

 | product/productId: 6300209210 | review/userId: AUTG0SP6HCJV8 | review/summary: I'd Hate to See His Worst | review/text: If this is considered his 'best' film, that is. I like groovy/trippy/campy flicks from the 60s and 70s, but this one lost my interest pretty quickly. First, I am a Klaus Kinski fan, and if you are as well, be prepared for disappointment since Klaus only appears in about 10-15 minutes of the movie and has some stupid sounding voice dubbed over his own! Aside from that, the film relied on the wooden acting of James Darren and the nakedness of Maria Rohm to keep my attention. Close, but not enough. I think the director was anticipating most of his audience would be puffing the magic dragon, making them more likely to be entertained by flashing lights, bad acid-jazz, random nudity, random dialogue etc.<br />Apparently there is some tricky ending that explains the whole incomprehensible design but I was too bored/sober to really care what all the weird stuff meant after half an hour of one totally unrelated scene after another. Bummer.
 | product/productId: 6302142237 | review/userId: A1XXL9MKTF13KK | review/summary: Enjoyable, 3.5 Stars | review/text: Overall, a fairly enjoyable film. However, as an ardent history buff and someone who has spent years reading about JFK's life and tragic death at the hands of Lee Oswald, the film is significantly flawed in its history regarding Kennedy and especially his death in Dallas. However, given that this movie is not meant to be a history lesson, but is instead meant as a sweet ode to the love of brothers, one can shake off their inner history geek and kick back for a fun rainy day show. The cast does fairly well, especially Sam Wanamaker as Koopman. I really liked the score in this film, and in some ways, this film was a predecessor to movies like "The Butterfly Effect" with its suggestion of how changing just one thing could affect the entire course of world events. Overall, a fairly entertaining movie, one that I'm happy to own. That being said, I have to pass my warnings along to fellow Kennedy buffs and warn you that you will  find yourself going, "Hey, wait a minute. That's not how it looked...." =) Don't let that discourage you, though, as this movie is a fun little journey of its own.
 | product/productId: 156730138X | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: Lamerica | review/text: Made at the height of the Albanian refugee crisis, Amelio's absorbing drama is a nightmarish vision of poverty, conflict, and despair in post-Communist Europe's most isolated nation. As Gino is systematically stripped of every luxury item and form of identification he possesses by the ruthless people he encounters, the irony of his situation becomes crystal clear, especially when brash exploiter-turned-weary refugee Gino (Lo Verso in an exquisite, haunting performance) joins a wave of migrants hoping to sneak across the border to the West--and a better life. Visually striking and genuinely moving, "Lamerica" is an unforgettable look at a land devastated by dictatorial politics and world neglect, and those desperate to leave.

It is full of gothic atmosphere that is achieved through wonderful set design, lighting and photography.

But, as said, it is a fine piece of filmmaking that is well crafted by its director Freddie Francis.

 | product/productId: 5552286219 | review/userId: A11BQXTMP37M2S | review/summary: Not a very good movie. | review/text: This plot didn't make a lot of sense.  We are told dragons have taken over the skies of earth, yet we hardly see any flying around.  I rented this because Gerard Butler is in it.  He has the best lines then gets killed off.  Christian Bale has an angry expression on his face for the entire movie, I bet he was sorry he signed the contract.  Matthew McConnaughy chews up the scenery with gusto, he looks like the only one having any fun.  If the dragons only eat ash, why do they chomp on people?  This is for hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans only.

 | product/productId: 0792837576 | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: A Sharp Comic Rap Across The Corporate Knuckles | review/text: One of the most often overlooked movie musicals of the 1960s is also one of the most successful: the screen version of the Broadway smash HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, which delivers a sharp comic rap across the corporate knuckles in its tale of a nobody (Robert Morse) who uses a self-help book to rocket up the corporate ladder--and by the time our hero reaches the heights, romantic complications leads him to wonder what price corporate success.<p>Although the business world has changed quite a bit since 1967, SUCCEED is so dead-on with its attack that even modern corporate leaders will be bloodied from the fray.  The company is just large enough so that no one knows what is actually going on, leadership cries out for creative solutions then promptly fires any one who shows a talent for it, and promotion doesn't hinge so much upon ability as it does upon [kissing] up, backstabbing, and looking like you know what you're doing.  There are jabs at dressing for success, the idea that employees don't engage in sexual hankypanky, hidden nepotism, and the importance of belonging to the "right" clubs.  And along the way our hero meets the classic business crowd: the company man, the bombshell secretary, the boss' nephew, and a host of largely incompetent yes-men VPs.<p>The film is very stylized, making no pretense at naturalism per se, and the cast follows suit, playing in a way that blends beautifully with the self-boosting and jingoistic tone that pervades the piece.  Robert Morse gives a truly brilliant performance in the lead--and one wonders why Hollywood so seldom used him in later years; Michele Lee, as the secretary who befriends him, is equally fine, and the supporting cast is wonderful all the way around.  The musical numbers (which includes such numbers as "The Company Way," "A Secretary Is Not A Toy," "It's Been A Long Day," and "Brotherhood of Man") are remarkably sly and memorably performed.  All in all, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING is sure to appeal to any one who has had the misfortune to graple with the idiocies of corporate America--and it will almost certainly outrage every "company man" on your city block.  Strongly recommended, but make sure you get the widescreen version; pan-and-scan doesn't cut it on this one!
 | product/productId: 6300198731 | review/userId: ANLK82RZN2UIB | review/summary: Finally | review/text: First a viewing years ago on television, then I bought the standard screen video.  A few years later the Widescreen Video, bought that.  Now the DVD in all its glory.  What a marvelous show and battle of wits and of course the dialogue.  I usually watch a double feature of "The Lion in Winter" and "Becket" with great food and to enjoy the dialogue.  I would introduce students to Shakespeare and other classic by first having them watch Becket.  It demonstrated to them that period style speech can be entertaining.<br /><br />Becket is generally regarded as historically accurate except for the fact that Thomas Becket himself was Norman, not Saxon.  How one deals with the issues of loyalty to King and God can be a model, although a sad one for all political leaders.<br /><br />I am pleased with the DVD I purchased and really enjoy the extras provided.<br /><br />Get yours now!!!!!

 | product/productId: 6300269434 | review/userId: A2FOT0QE23VN6J | review/summary: Good performances | review/text: "Young Man with a Horn" is a biopic based on the life of Bix Beiderbecke (1903-1931), a jazz cornetist, pianist, and composer. Beiderbecke was one of the major jazz figures of the 1920s, as well known as Louis Armstrong in his day. The film is based on a 1938 (first) novel by Dorothy Baker.<br /><br />Top billed Kirk Douglas (1916) was an emerging star when this film was made. He had just been nominated for an Oscar for "Champion" (1949) and would get 2 more - "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952) and "Lust for Life" (1957) and win the Golden Globe for "Lust for Life". His memorable roles include  "Paths of Glory" (1957),  "The Vikings" (1958), "Spartacus" (1960) and "Seven Days in May" (1964). He appears as #17 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.<br /><br />Douglas was always at home playing self-destructive characters ("Champion", "Two Weeks in Another Town") and he applies that same intensity in this film.<br /><br />FWIW - Douglas' musical numbers were done by famed jazz musician Harry James.<br /><br />Sexy Lauren Bacall (1924) gets second billing. Bacall made her sizzling film debut in "To Have and Have Not" (1944) and went on to co-star with Bogart in "The Big Sleep" (1946) and "Dark Passage" (1947). She was nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA for "The Mirror has Two Faces" (1996) and won the Golden Globe and SAG for that film. She had 3 Emmy nominations. I think she did her best acting in "The Shootist" (1976) for which she received a BAFTA nomination. Bacall plays Douglas's wife.<br /><br />Cute as apple pie Doris Day (1924) is best known as a hit making singer and a TV host (1968-73), but she also did films and was nominated for an Oscar for "Pillow Talk" (1959). She made 30+ films, most of them musical comedies. At the time this film was made she was busy and appeared in 3 films in 1950 and 4 in 1951, usually as the second female lead (as she is in this film). Day plays Douglas' friend.<br /><br />Day reported that she was unhappy making this film, because Douglas and Bacall were so friendly and because her own life as a band singer had been filled with pain. Unhappy or not, she manages to sing 3 great songs - "With a Song in my Heart", "The Very Thought of You", and "Too Marvelous for Words" and does a terrific job acting.<br /><br />Irrepressible Hoagy Carmichael (1899-1981) was a pianist, composer, singer, and actor, who knew the real Bix upon whom the film is based. His dozen film appearances include two Oscar nominations and 1 win ("Here Comes the Groom", 1951). He's probably best known for "Cricket", the piano player in "To Have and Have Not" (1944), a film that starred Lauren Bacall who stars in this film. Carmichael narrates the film and plays Douglas's long time friend.<br /><br />The scene stealer in this film is Juano Hernandez (1896-1970) who plays the musician who first recognizes Douglas' talent as a child and takes him under his wing. His debut in "Intruder in the Dust" (1949) earned him a Golden Globe nomination.<br /><br />Director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration ("Captain Blood", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - "Angels with Dirty Faces"(1938) and "Yankee Doddle Dandy" (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart ("Casablanca", 1942), one of eight they made together. Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared "The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself."<br /><br />1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for "All About Eve" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), "Cyrano" (Actor) and "Born Yesterday" (Actress).  The top grossers included "Cinderella", "King Solomon's Mines", "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Sunset Boulevard". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  "The Asphalt Jungle", "Cheaper by the Dozen", "The Glass Menagerie", "Rashomon", "The Third Man", and "Twelve O'Clock High".<br /><br />Biopics about musicians are common - "The Fabulous Dorseys" (1947), "The Great Caruso" (1951), "The Glenn Miller Story" (1954), "Lady Sings the Blues" (1972), "The Buddy Holly Story" (1978), "Amadeus" (1984), "La Bamba" (1987), "Bird" (1988), "The Doors" (1991),  "What's Love Got to Do With It" (1993), "Selena" (1997), "Walk the Line" (1995), "Ray" (2004), and "I'm Not There" (2007).<br /><br />This is certainly not one of the best musician biopics even done, and the choice (after a preview) to change the ending does subtract from the power of the film. That being said, it was a chance for Kirk Douglas to widen his reach and show that he was an effective actor, and a chance for Doris Day to show that she was an actress as well as a singer.<br /><br />Bottom line - Jazz enthusiasts, fans of the actors, and fans of good biopics will enjoy this film.

Like other Historical films this movie is over two hours long. This movie also stars: Fredric March, Claire Bloom, Harry Andrews, Stanley Baker, plus others. This movie is filmed in Widescreen format (2:35:1) and in Color. If you are a fan of these actors or this type of genre, then this movie is for you! I would recommend this to anyone.
 | product/productId: 0792158288 | review/userId: A2F3M93RRLFQNJ | review/summary: On DVD at last | review/text: This set of DVDs contains one of my all-time favorite movies and its two sequels.  On the merits of the original movie alone, this boxed set gets five stars.  The remainder is almost supplemental.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic adventure movie, an almost flawless film that introduces Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, archaeology professor and treasure hunter in the 1930s.  Recruited by the government to find the Ark of the Covenant (containing the remains of the Ten Commandments), Jones soon runs afoul of the others seeking the Ark, in particular the Nazis and his arch-nemesis, Belloq.  Belloq is actually the best villain in the entire series, an amoral archaelogist whose ambition seems to be to become Jones, so he is always seeking to emulate Indy's professional and romantic successes.<p>Temple of Doom -easily the weakest of the three - is supposedly a prequel to Raiders.  It is not so much action-packed as action-crammed, with so much fighting and fleeing that there is no real time for any real characters.  The villains are second-rate and the cute kid sidekick is annoying, but most grating is Kate Capshaw's character who is thoroughly unpleasant and pales in comparison to the much more interesting Marion Ravenwood in the first movie.  There are also contradictions created by this movie taking place earlier than Raiders:  how can Indy be so skeptical of the supernatural in Raiders if he has previously undergone the Temple of Doom adventures?<p>The Last Crusade returns to the spirit of the original movie, bringing back old characters and situations.  Although there is no Marion, we do have Sean Connery as Indiana Jones's father.  The two of them are racing against the Nazis to find the Holy Grail.  If not quite as good as the original, it is still a decent movie.<p>This is not so much a trilogy as a series, the distinction being that a trilogy is essentially one long story (like Star Wars or the Matrix) and a series is a sequence of individual stories focused on the same characters (like James Bond or the Lethal Weapon movies).  As a series, each movie must be judged on it own merits, and as such, this is a set of one great, one good and one so-so movie.  The supplemental materials are interesting, but if you skip them, you aren't missing a whole lot.  Buy this set for Raiders (which you can't get by itself), and maybe The Last Crusade.

The DVD needs to be re-released for an improved version. The movie is on two sides, which is no good. The extras are limited. The movies  sound and color are average.

 | product/productId: 0790736233 | review/userId: A3CSRP3P4U9HI | review/summary: Top notch, thoughtful sci-fi | review/text: This movie tells an intelligent story about a possible type of first contact between humanity and an extra-terrestrial civilization.  While that is part of the reason that I gave this movie 5 stars, I was even more  impressed by the director's ability to catch a glimpse of what can be the  dog-eat-dog world of scientific funding, credit and credibility.  <p>Jodi  Foster plays a brilliant, budding young scientist who wants to pursue SETI  (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) work.  Her former mentor (Tom  Skerritt), now head of the National Science Foundation (the government's  primary funding agency for science), sees that work as professional  suicide.  He then does what he can to pull the rug out from under her and  her work.  In the meantime, Foster meets McConaughey, a handsome ex-priest  who seeks truth not via science, but through spirituality.<p>When Foster  recognizes that contact is taking place and she makes that information  public, Skerritt swoops in and attempts to take control of the project.<p>I  am extremely impressed by this movie's ability to tell a great story of a  possibility, presenting the premis of non-confrontational contact.  This is  no shoot-em up movie.  It does, however, have a healthy dose of special  effects, but those effects are not the heart of the show.  <p>There are  interesting plot developments, instructive insights into the lengths that  some scientists may go to gain recognition among their professional peers,  and the conflict that some scientists face when they realize that there are  more ways to learn about who we are and why we are than via science.<p>I  encourage you to give this movie a look.  The combination of story, acting,  special effects, and implications of the story make for a great movie!<p>5  stars all the way.<p>Alan Holyoak

 | product/productId: 0780021185 | review/userId: A3U56M0Y8LYO6J | review/summary: "It's interesting to make fortunate men unfortunate." | review/text: Although he is best known for his samurai epics, "High and Low" proves that Akira Kurosawa can handle material of a different nature just as effectively.  Helping him out is constant collaborator Toshir Mifune whose character is also a change of pace from the familiar<br /><br />Japanese businessman Kingo Gondo (Mifune) is working on a plan to acquire control of a local shoe company.  A crisis soon emerges when he receives a phone call telling him his son has been kidnapped.  Gondo is devastated because paying the ransom would mean the planned takeover will not go through.  The situation then changes when Gondo realizes it was not his son who was kidnapped but rather the son of his chauffeur.  Now knowing that the kidnapper has made an error, Gondo must decide whether he will still go ahead and pay the ransom.<br /><br />"High and Low" not only works as a police procedural thriller but as a philosophical conundrum.  Would you give up your dream and endanger the financial security of your family in order to save the life of another?  Kurosawa ably examines this difficult question through the lens of Japanese culture and the nuances of its class system.  Perfectly channeling all of the conflicting emotions at work is Mifune who turns in an outstanding performance.  Although his acting is rather subdued in "High and Low," he skillfully conveys all the pain and agony Gondo goes through via his facial expressions and body language.  Fans of both Kurosawa and Mifune who are looking for a story set in more modern times will not be disappointed with this small but satisfying film.
 | product/productId: 0792843592 | review/userId: A11PTCZ2FM2547 | review/summary: Magical | review/text: From the opening scenes of this film--majestic shots of a car traveling the rural midwest on a crisp autumn morning--HOOSIERS serves notice to the viewer that he or she is in for a wonderful movie experience.  Set in a tiny Indiana town half a century ago, HOOSIERS captures the look and feel of rural Americana, of a hardworking people with a single commonality:  their love for basketball.  The pure innocence of this film, innocence long lost over the subsequent decades, is magical.<p>Gene Hackman portrays Coach Norman Dale, an outsider who comes to basketball-crazy Hickory, Indiana, to coach the high school team.  Haunted by mistakes made in his past, Dale is eager for the second chance he has been given.  Immediately, his no-nonsense, stress-the-fundamentals coaching philosophy puts him at odds with the town, yet Dale refuses to compromise his principles.  He survives--barely--a petition for his ouster, and the rest of the movie warmly portrays the town of Hickory and its high school basketball team coming together, a team that makes a magical run through the Indiana State Tournament.<p>Barbara Hershey as Myra Fleener, Hickory's assistant principal, and Sheb Wooley as superintendent/principal Cletus--the man who hires Dale--are solid.  Yet Dennis Hopper gives the best performance as Wilbur &quot;Shooter&quot; Flatch.  Shooter, a former great player himself and father of one of the boys on Coach Dale's team, is the town drunk; despite his alcoholism, his knowledge of the game is immense, and Dale enlists his aid.  The reformation of this character--the feeling and depth that Hopper gives this role--is exceptional.<p>Director David Anspaugh gives us a sensational &quot;feel good&quot; movie, augmented by Jerry Goldsmith's powerful musical score.  HOOSIERS tells a beautiful story, so magical in its depiction you'll be cheering from your chair.  Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 6300268993 | review/userId: A1COW0UIB5HA9J | review/summary: Best of the sequels! | review/text: After the events of the original Superman, the Man of Steel ( Christopher Reeve) just saved Lois Lane from terrorists in Paris as he throws their thermonuclear divoce into space that accidently breaks the three evil Kryptonian criminals " Zod, Ursa and Non" ( Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Holloren) out of their space prison to enslave the Earth with the help of "Lex Luthor" ( Gene Hackman) as only Superman must stop them. But unfortunately for Clark Kent, he wants to give up his superpowers for good so he can be with Lois ( Margot Kidder) as she finally figured out who Clark really and is now a mortal without no mere strength or power. However, the country and the world are in mortal danger from the fearsome four but can Clark Kent change back to Superman or will the world be doom?<br /><br />Excellent second part that proves that a sequel can work as much as "X-Men 2", "Spider-Man 2", "Godfather 2", "Empire Strikes Back", "Dawn of the Dead ( 1978)", "Evil Dead 2" and some others can do. The acting is top notch, The villians are preety belivable including the sexy Sarah Douglas as Ursa! there's also some good special effects for it's time, E.G. Marshall does an appearence as the president and there's plenty of action to satisfy the viewer's taste.<br /><br />The DVD has only two features which is a trailer and bios, but the picture and sound are good but not great! i hear there's going to be 2-disc special editions of all 4 movies coming out on DVD this summer to cash-in on "Superman Returns".<br /><br />A recommended sequel!
 | product/productId: 1558808809 | review/userId: A1K0XHNAJCUCMO | review/summary: 3 Stars For 3 Outstanding Performances... | review/text: Kubrick replaced Tony Mann on directing duties for this brave, but lumbering costume epic which is ultimately propped up by three beautiful performances. Peter Ustinov(won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work here), Charles Laughton(should have been similarly nominated)&amp; Laurence Olivier all do incredible work under the guidance of a very young Kubrick &amp; all deliver what comes very close to their best work. Their presence is notable chiefly for the fact that without them, SPARTACUS would never have been the extraordinary spectacle it surely is. Kirk Douglas gives a brooding(&amp; lifeless)performance in the title role, ultimately undermining any sequence not containing the three aforementioned thespians. Jean Simmons, as the love interest, is similarly uninteresting &amp; while undeniably beautiful, fails to evoke for the viewer the love &amp; devotion she receives from Douglas &amp; ultimately Olivier. Pre CGI, it comes armed with some beautifully choreographed &amp; violent battle sequences, but for those looking for an earlier version of Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, this one may come off a little old-fashioned. It is worth noting(&amp; you'll learn this from the wonderfully insightful 1992 Ustinov interview[his impersonation of Laughton is a riot]contained in the bonus material)that Ustinov rewrote all the scenes he plays with Laughton. It should come as no surprise to the discerning viewer, they are easily the best moments in the film.....

 | product/productId: 0767020308 | review/userId: A1NVIEXCA20W7N | review/summary: Pleasant. Relaxed-pace, ok once. | review/text: Visually appealing. Pretty dresses, houses, and scenery. Better than television. Only 3-stars, because the script could be better. 3-stars compared to "Pride and Prejudice". This is the best version so far. Pleasant to watch once.<br /><br />Emma meddles in her friend's romances to their harm.<br /><br />We see Emma insulting nice people. We see Emma being condescending to her friends; meaning Emma's attitude shows Emma is thinking how she is better than her friends, rather than being thankful for her friend's friendship, kindness, and good qualities. Emma is prideful, because Emma values appearance, charm, money, and power, which she has, more than the truly valuable, friendship, good-character, kindness, and goodness that her poor friends have.<br /><br />If you liked this, you should like "Under the Greenwood Tree", which has more humor. Even better is "North and South", "Wives and Daughters", and "Pride and Prejudice"-1995 or 1940.<br /><br />My suggestions for a remake of this film are under the "comment" button below.

 | product/productId: 1400316111 | review/userId: A1HOLJW15Q5S5V | review/summary: Banal & Amateurish Compared to the Old Series | review/text: Ten years ago, my six year old loved Bibleman, and so did I. Willie Aames and company did a great job in whipping up a series of funny DVDs that taught some practical Biblical wisdom with enough chuckles to "make the medicine go down" easily. We bought the DVDs, watched them over and over, bought the costume, even went to a live stage show.<br /><br />So even though my kids are older now, I still have a soft spot in my heart for the Bibleman character. Consequently, I got a review copy of one of the newer episodes, Combating the Commandment of Confusion, and watched it with my eleven year old son.<br /><br />I could not have been more disappointed.<br /><br />First, it was a poorly-done recording of a live stage show in a church. Lighting, audio, costumes, & cinematography were all sub-standard, bordering on amateur. Second, the story itself was banal: no plot, no intelligence, and none of the old wit & charm of the old series. Within a few minutes my son was pleading to watch something else, and I had to force myself to finish out the DVD. My recommendation: find one of the old series instead.

I just attended a viewing of the movie at my local IMAX in Hutchinson, KS and was totally impressed and overwhelmed with the emotion of the film on an IMAX.  With my tour of the Cosmosphere and seeing all of the Apollo artifacts that NASA has gracously given to us to carry on history to our children, it has made me more connected to our past history of space exploration.  I hope that if anyone can get to an IMAX that they go because there will not be a dry eye in the house.  As for my copy of Apollo 13 I will cherish it for as long as I don't where it out.
 | product/productId: 0790744651 | review/userId: A2RHV42BTJSVON | review/summary: A great example of what makes a good musical... | review/text: It is true that musicals are making a comeback in the last six years, but I find myself asking whether or not that is a good thing.  Most of the musicals released (with the exception of High School Musical), lose the fun and innocence that encopassed the original movie musical.  Musicals like "Moulin Rouge" and "Chicago" were good, but failed to be great because they could not reach a broad audience, the content was too mature.  "Dream Girls" hits a little closer to the mark of what a great musical is, but even then it is still a little too mature for most audiences.  Like all great movies, they are timeless and endearing no matter when they were made.<br /><br />  I had never heard of Gigi until I purchased a boxset of Oscar Winning musicals (some good, and some not so good).  My friend viewed it first and said it was wonderful.  I watched it and thought to myself "What is she talking about?"  That was a year ago, and since then I have probably watched it about fifty different times.  What at first seemed like another run of the mill musical, turned out to be a witty and charming musical that is at times light and frother, and at other time very serious.<br /><br />  Some of the humor is very adult, but it is subtle and there is nothign raunchy or rude in it.  Although characters like Honore come very close, he generally ends up coming off as sweet and generally a typical rich playboy.  This is where we find Gaston, who is bored with the playboy lifestyle, but doesn't want to settle down and take responsibility.  Gigi, is probably about 14 or 15, and does not want to settle down either, she is still a "little girl", and is considered by her relatives as being "from another planet".<br /><br />  I cannot reveal too much about the plot, but it is not hard to see where this is going, and let me just say that if you are uneasy with older men being with younger women, you may not like this movie; However, in days of old, this was quite common.<br /><br />  If you like a good movie that is sweet, cute, fun, clever, you will love Gigi, even if you hate musicals.  It has a great story, and great characters, and it is just a lot of fun to watch.  I would say it is pretty close to the quality of "My Fair Lady".  The songs will definitely get stuck in your head (The night they invented Champagne, Thank Heaven For Little Girls, I Remember it Well, ect).<br /><br />  God Bless & *ENJOY* ~Amy

The Frenchman Never Had A Chance! | review/text: In this superior movie from the Raoul Walsh/Warner Bros stable, the late and great Gregory Peck gives a masterful performance as C.S. Forester's swashbuckling hero Horatio Hornblower as he takes on a Spanish man-of-war - the "Natividad", a South American dictator with delusions of grandeur and the might of Napoleonic France, and still has time to win the heart of the Duke of Wellington's sister played by screen beauty Virginia Mayo.  Some guys have all the luck!<br /><br />It might be a `done-to-death' cliche, but they really don't make movies like this anymore! Under an equally masterful Director, the pace-setting script, a strong supporting cast, a stirring musical score and some wonderful cinematography really make this a Greg Peck classic.  British actors Terrence Morgan (Brit TV's -The Buccaneers), James Robertson Justice (Murder She Said) and Stanley Baker (Zulu) both of whom would later appear with Peck in The Guns of Navarone, manage to give the film an authentic British feel.<br /><br />But Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951) is truly `Hollywood'. 1950s British Cinema had some wonderful moments with a steady stream of classic `black and white' war films and mould-breaking films with a social message, but up against this colourful costume drama, they could hardly expect to get close.  I am sure C.S. Forester would have approved of the Hollywood treatment and not one piece of digital, computer wizardry in sight!  How refreshing!

 | product/productId: 0792842111 | review/userId: A1534MBU6VJXYN | review/summary: "Closer!" | review/text: For years, my parents had banished me from watching "The Silence Of The Lambs", saying it was "too scary". However, I had begged my parents to let me watch it. So, I put it on my Christmas list, and low and behold, it was sitting under my Christmas tree on December 25th. However, I did not watch it until today.<br /><br />A serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is kidnapping women across the Midwest and murdering them by skinning them alive. Baffled by these disturbing turn of events, the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a prisoner who could give anwers to the killer's motivations. That prisoner is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cannibal who is also a brilliant pyschologist who knows everything about the criminal mind. He agrees to help Clarice, but only if she divulges to him the dark details of her own life. But when Bill kidnaps the daughter of a renowned Memphis senator, Clarice cannot play this game any longer, for time is running out. This leads to a startling climax that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />"The Silence Of The Lambs" truly deserves the praise that is heaped upon it. It is one of if not the best suspense thrillers ever made. This film is so disturbing that one wonders if all this really happened (indeed, Buffalo Bill was actually an amalgam of several different real life serial killers).<br /><br />The acting is superb. Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice. She portrays this tough, courageous and fearful women like no one else can and she truly deserved the Best Actres Oscar. Ted Levine is so creepy that it actually makes you sick. Why he was not awarded is something I've pondered. Scott Glenn adds ample support in the lesser role of Clarice's boss, Jack Crawford. However, throughout, the whole film, our focus remains on Hopkins. As Lecter, Hopkins creates one of the single greatest performances in film history. You wait in anticipation for what he's going to say or do next. You are drawn into the mind of this man. One could never imagine that a man who eats people could be so likeable.<br /><br />the extra features I haven't watched yet, but they look great. Still, you should definitely watch the film first. It's worth it, trust me.
 | product/productId: 6301977394 | review/userId: A1AC9S8U66SNMU | review/summary: So twisted it is almost absurd | review/text: 2 hours and 30+ minutes. If it had lasted longer even Churchill would have been made into a double agent. As for pure entertainment and for lovers of twisted plots this may not be a bad choice. As a film pure and simple it has no quality, and only relies on the machinations of its script and the fine performances of the two main stars. As for locations -a travel documentary with bits of European history- it could do.<br /><br />The saying goes that reality always surpasses fiction, well fiction has reached its limits in this one, an inch further and it would be lough out loud comedy. Honestly bored I found myself hanging in there just to see how they pull this one off. And if you can make it after the first 90 minutes I recommend you see the thing through, just to get something back for your time.<br /><br />This should have been a tv series. It's got the meat for it. But not a movie. As a classic film fan I should have stayed away from this film, but one always feels tempted to check out what is it that so many people find deserving a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, again, I was disappointed..

The settings range from city, to lush countryside to a working man's neighborhood  and pub, to a bustling hospital. There's lots of action as well as some incredibly steamy love scenes.<br /><br />Reckless is a series to watch more than once. I never tire of revisiting Anna and Owen and all the other characters.

 | product/productId: 0780621956 | review/userId: A2OLM3EXS7JHZ8 | review/summary: Deadly American Satire | review/text: Really good satire should be both funny and destructive, like Voltaire or Swift or Mark Twain at his darkest. Wag the Dog scores on both counts.<p>The film is on traget in its depiction of Americans as sentimental and gullible dupes who will fall for flag-waving flim-flam and who can be gulled by media hype. The President, a week or so away from re-election, is caught dallying with a 12 year old Firefly Girl in the Oval Office and seems doomed. Enter Robert di Niro as a master crisis manager. He enlists an egomaniacal Hollywood producer (smarmily played by Dustin Hoffman) and an an anxiety-ridden Presidential aide (Ann Heche) in a plot to concoct a phony war with Albania that will draw attention from the scandal.<p>The superb set pieces include the filming of a war-torn orphan girl (Kirsten Dunst in a cameo) fleeing a burning village--all done in a studio, with special effects. The sequence makes you wonder about so many other exclusive bits of news film and also shows the cynicism and manipulation of the media. My very favorite bit involves the writing of a stirring patriotic song by a gin-soaked country star (Willy Nelson). He comes up with some delicious claptrap about guarding the Canadian border (against invading Albanians!!) and then records it with a huge chorus replete with heart-rending solos. The result is a dead-on, riotous send-up of Michael Jackson's &quot;We Are the World.&quot; There's also a terrific scene where Di Niro's character cons a straight-arrow CIA agent (William Macy) out of turning him in.<p>When the CIA announces that there is no Albanian threat, the scam artists switch gears and concoct a &quot;war hero&quot; missing behind enemy lines. They pick a soldier named Shoemaker and begin a fad by tossing old shoes over telephone wires (soon everyone is doing this--a glorious attack on the idiotic festooning of yellow ribbons whenever an American is missing somewhere). When they attempt to bring &quot;Old Shoe&quot; (Woody Harrelson) back for a hero's welcome, he turns out to be a psychotic rapist. A plane crash and an infuriated father's shotgun blast later, Old Shoe is dead, and Di Niro and company stage a funeral with a stirring Green Beret type song and a grieving dog. When Hoffman's character refuses to hush up his brilliant producing job, he meets a dark fate.<p>The writing is savage and all too true, and the acting is excellent. I held back a star for the pacing, which seems to me all wrong. A satire like this should crackle and move at a breakneck pace (like Kubrick's Doctor Strangelove), but the film ambles in a style that seems right for a sentimental drama. Still, I laugh and cringe every time I see it.
 | product/productId: 6302149606 | review/userId: A3CN9CCJUNIPKT | review/summary: Classic film noir! | review/text: Tough guys don't come tougher than Charles McGraw as a hard-nosed, gravel-voiced West Coast cop who's been detailed to escort a mob widow cross-country to her date with the Los Angeles grand jury.  This taut film noir takes place on the tight confines of a passenger train,  brilliantly blocked in a series of tight corners and cramped cabins.  The direction is perfect, though... You  never lose your way or wonder where the action has taken you, and the stifling sense of oppressive constriction matches the McGraw's mood as he steadily runs out of options.  Great, gritty dialog, particularly from femme fatale Marie Windsor (who is a dead ringer for Ilyana Douglas) and several running gags that bring character to a fast-moving film.
 | product/productId: 6300215741 | review/userId: A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ | review/summary: What a catch! | review/text: Alfred Hitchcock made two kinds of movies: bone-chilling thrillers that looked into the dark side of human nature, and witty adventure stories.<br /><br />"To Catch A Thief" is a sterling example of the latter kind of movie -- a chic, sleek, golden-tinted caper, full of witty dialogue and solid acting from legendary actors. Despite the taut action scenes, Hitchcock makes it feel almost like a cinematic vacation.<br /><br />Paul Robie (Cary Grant) was "The Cat," the most notorious jewel thief in Europe, before he retired. But now impossible heists -- made in Robie's style -- are popping up all over Cannes, and he's the immediate suspect. Narrowly escaping the police, he enlists a friend to help him clear his name by capturing this new Cat.<br /><br />To do that, he masquerades as an American tourist, and gets to know pretty oil heiress Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly) and her mother. But when the Stevens jewels are stolen, Frances brings the cops down on Robie -- and now he is more desperate than ever to find the Cat, because he suspects it's an old friend...<br /><br />Hitchcock was in fine form with "To Catch a Thief," especially since he had two great actors in the mix. Granted this isn't one of his more insightful or suspenseful movies, but it captures a sense of sly wit and fun instead.<br /><br />If "To Catch A Thief" has a problem, it's that astute viewers will be able to guess who the  Cat is after about a half hour, maximum. But fortunately viewers can be distracted by Hitchcock's knack for razor-sharp dialogue ("What do you say?" "My only comment would be highly censorable") and double entendres (during an intimate lunch, Francie asks, "You want a leg or a breast?").<br /><br />It's also gorgeous to behold -- he entire movie is bathed in the golden Riviera sun, with lots of swimming, fast car chases, elaborate costume balls, and ornate hotels. But Hitchcock winds it up with a genuinely tense rooftop chase, complete with wrestling and gunshots.<br /><br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life. Kelly is also quite good as an heiress who is less prim than she appears; John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis have fun supporting roles as a "veddy veddy English" insurance man and a shrewd rich woman.<br /><br />"To Catch A Thief" is a warm, sumptuous piece of classic film, with great dialogue and even better acting. Fun, stylish little mystery.

One of the best scenes is the fight scene with Roddy Piper and Keith David and I was disappointed about the dvd because there's no special features, not even a trailer. At least,The picture and sound are good. If anybody's a fan of Carpenter as I am, this is the movie to own.

 | product/productId: 157252796X | review/userId: A34JOCHDVC53C9 | review/summary: Pound, an enigma | review/text: I have study Pound under Hugh Kenner, at UCSB. I was English major, and Pound turned me onto ancient Greek, Florence, and much of cultural history. He was also an enigma. His happiest years were spent in St. Elizabeth's  mental hospital, and much of his philosophy would be appreciated by modern  skinheads and the Montana malita. As a youth I was taught and assumed that  poets were philosophers, Pound of course proved that theory wrong. Some of  Pound's work is of course inspired. Some is depraved, paranoid and insane.  Pound's impact on modern literature is undeniable to those who have studied  him. A genius, he was disappointing and misguided in life.<p>Most of the  drama of his life, his association with Eliot, Hemmingway, Picassos,  Gaudier and Joyce, his support of Mussolini and subsequent arrest, trail  and commitment to a mental hospital to escape charges of treason are not  well documented in this video. <p>This is one of the few videos/films on  Pound. So the images are much of what is available to date.

I am surprised how much I have gotten from this book!  It is refreshing to read a "parenting" book that is actually focused on the parents - our struggles, our emotions - and how we become better as a person through parenting.  I am almost done with the book, and already plan to re-read it.  Every chapter has been thought provoking and inspirational to me.  I appreciate the spiritual/religious aspect of it, though I feel others who are non-religious can also take something from it.
 | product/productId: 6301945301 | review/userId: A2H4AWIOK1REMX | review/summary: The perpetual Hollywood flaw | review/text: Movies do a great job of showing what is wrong in people's lives. Max's friends are boring, trite, self-absorbed, phony and tiring. All true. Who would want to live in that horrible world of pretense and deceit? (And yes, I am exaggerating quite a bit....)<br /><br />But what does he have in the hypnotizing world with Nora? We never see them talk. They have no relationship outside sex. And we already see that tapering off. They do nothing. Say nothing. Go nowhere. Have no interests. Life is about more than copulation and fellatio, no matter how skillfully performed. There are many hours spent that are not in bed. What did these people do during that time? He loves her? Yeah sure.....why?<br /><br />Lots of well-worn clich&eacute;s to fill in the time. Lots of slow-mo sex footage to make the essentially empty film last longer. I bet the novel was interesting. The film was not.

 | product/productId: 6301931793 | review/userId: AMRM049JDYN0A | review/summary: This is really why our great grandparents came to the US | review/text: I had the opportunity to watch this movie while I was in college earning a degree in Scandinavian Studies.  It was part of a required course, along with Fanny and Alexander, Wild Strawberries, The Pathfinder, Babette's  Feast, and My Life as a Dog (All of these are excellent movies).<p>My  grandparents came to the US from Sweden and Denmark during the early part  of the 20th century.  Until I saw this movie, I did not understand why they  chose to come here.  Now I have a strong appreciation of what they went  through to come to the US.  <p>This movie is quite incredible. It is very  difficult to watch, but not because of the direction/actors/story - but  because it brings up multiple, complex topics that are dealt with in a way  you probably have never seen before if you are used to watching movies with  happy, tidy endings.  Max Von Sydow, as usual, is excellent in this movie.  <p>I am REALLY upset that this is not available!  If you can get it, get  the one without the dubbing - Dubbing is a very bad thing and you really do  lose a lot in the translation.
 | product/productId: 6300183297 | review/userId: A1ABDWJU9RTUWU | review/summary: Youth Passing into Manhood | review/text: Rumble Fish opens with an image of the sky over a town, whose time-elapsed features morph as time passes before our eyes, so that we know that the story to follow takes place at a point in this infinite pool of days. The black and white cinematography, leather jackets and sneering star suggest that we are watching a film from the 50's, a forgotten contemporary of Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without a Cause; then the realization slowly seeps in that this dress, this attitude, define not an era of history but adolescence. Adolescence, when the scales are lifted from our eyes, and we see hypocrisy everywhere. An hypocrisy that fades into conventionality as we become older and unwilling conspirators. What once seemed certain evil now seems reasonable and necessary. But for that brief space of time, never captured again, we see things with a clarity  that makes us the ultimate outsiders.<br /><br />Such is the fate of Rusty James, who romanticizes his outsider status and whose identity revolves around his idol, the god-like Motorcycle Boy. As the film progresses the character reaches his epiphany, and his innocence is revealed for the illusion it really is, an illusion in a world of illusion. However, with the revelation comes the haunting remembrance of that dim dream of indestructability - like the fighting fish that give the film it's title, a captive of his ignorance of the outside world.<br /><br />Dillon is brilliant in portraying this vulnerable toughness, and the growth from the narcissism of youth to the tragic resignation of a mature person. Moving and profound, this expertly directed film deserves a wider viewership.
 | product/productId: 630133275X | review/userId: A2VKUKPP10BT3Y | review/summary: great DVD and worth the wait | review/text: This DVD is great, the picture quality on both the japanese and english version is excellent. The english version is slightly poorer in quality than the Japanese version, but still not bad. Both films look better than the recent 2 disc release of gojira/godzilla, less dust etc on screen. It is not as good of a film as the first godzilla, but definately worth owning. I got mine on january 5th and there is no trace of the problems mentioned below. The commentary is only on the english version, it is very informative and you find out alot about why the film was disquised as a non-godzilla sequel in its US release as Gigantis, the fire monster. Highly reccomended for godzilla fans and sci-fi fans in general.<br /><br />And, more films are on the way, the following films will be released:<br /><br />GHIDORAH THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER, INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER/MONSTER ZERO, ALL MONSTERS ATTACK/GODZILLA'S REVENGE, and TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA. There are plans to follow the Godzilla DVDs with Toho's RODAN and WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS.<br /><br />nice job! Cant wait for the japanese version of Rodan!
 | product/productId: 630021561X | review/userId: A1GF7BR6K22GZD | review/summary: FUN  SCI-FI  SHOCKER... | review/text: One of the most memorable titles of the 50's sci-fi/horror era is really a good little shocker in it's own right. Gloria Talbott marries Tom Tryon expecting marital bliss. Wrong. He won't make love to her, his behavior is weird, the dog is afraid of him, he disappears at night, etc., and spooky stuff is going on in the woods. It's a small town and some of his friends notice these things too. But then THEY start acting weird, there's a monster zapping people to death and pretty soon no one believes Gloria's concerns. Talbott made some campy films in the 50's but this is one of the better ones. And of course everyone knows that Tryon wrote the classic "The Other" that was made into a wonderful film. So "Monster" is a welcome addition to DVD for fans for many reasons. The monsters are pretty cool for the era and there's a great scene of Tryon standing on a balcony and lightening flashes revealing his true appearance. This is the kind of 50's fun that I wish was more available on DVD. Watch for this one.
 | product/productId: 5559477893 | review/userId: A18YVBS4IVIOYG | review/summary: The Grapes of Wrath | review/text: While I loved the book madly, I simply liked the film version of it very much.  I guess my only complaint, if I had to list one in order to justify not giving it five stars, is that it was made in 1940.  The actors are good; the story is great.  If you like classic movies--like I do--you'll really like this one.  It's better than most of the classics I've seen.  But I can also sympathize with those people who find that the older movies put them to sleep.  If that's the case with you, you probably won't enjoy this one, either.
 | product/productId: 0792833201 | review/userId: A29ONI8P4N2GPE | review/summary: First-class Ghost Story! | review/text: Forget the controversy over who REALLY directed this movie (Hooper or Spieldberg). All that matters is that this one is a classic! If you really think about it, the premise is as hokey as they come (a girl gets zapped into the other-side through a TV and the best route to saving her is through her bedroom closet). But somehow the goofiness is made palatable thanks to brilliant directing and a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith. I always remember this movie more for the music and it's quotable, sing-songy dialgoue (&quot;Cross over children...all are Welcome...all Welcome&quot;...), especially from Tangina.<p>The brilliance in the directing shows through in the movie's ability to put such a breathless adventure inside a house. What should have felt claustrophic and flat is instead a movie that's fun, energetic and touching. The performances are top-notch, and the viewer really feels the characters are taking this &quot;crisis&quot; seriously. <p>As good as the directing, acting and special effects are, I recommend seeing this movie more for the music. Never, in my opinion, has Goldsmith been better. He perfectly captures both the innocence and horror of the movie, weaving the two together into a truly memorable score. The tornado scene ranks as one of the hokiest moments every featured in modern horror cinema, but it sure is a wild ride thanks to Goldsmith's urgent scoring of the scene and great editing.<p>I would forget the two sequels. Part 2 takes itself way too seriously and Part 3 is just plain bad.

 | product/productId: 0783235666 | review/userId: A16PT8F1CWWP27 | review/summary: Not Hitchcock's Best | review/text: I must preface my review by saying I am not a horror fan, but I am a Hitchcock fan so I wasn't sure whether I'd like The Birds.  I tried to watch it with an open mind.  Even with the dated special effects and annoying electronic bird squawking, it was scary-- especially the scene where they're trapped in the house just waiting for the next bird attack.<br />However, the script and characters in this film are severely lacking.  The romance between Melanie and Mitch is not only far-fetched but annoying.  What does he see in her?  I usually disagree with Hitchcock in his choice of women; he likes the icy blonde ditzes.  'Tippi' Hedren is a Grace Kelly clone, and I didn't care for Grace Kelly.  Worst acting award goes to the girl who plays Cathy.  I have never seen a more wooden performance in my life.  Amazingly awful.  The rest of the characters weren't much better.  The mother was scarier than the birds (sidenote: there are a lot of creepy characters in this movie- the elevator man is another), but at least she didn't like Melanie either.  Who could like someone with an IQ that low? "Hmm, Lydia told me to pick up Cathy from school immediately, but they're singing a horrible song.  Should I rescue her?  No, I'll smoke a cigarette outside." "Hmm there's a million birds outside.  Let's go outside children!" "Oh my gosh, the gas station's exploding and birds are attacking everything!  Let me just go outside and get a better view from this phone-booth!  Ooh, maybe I can open and close the door randomly!  Here come some birds: open.  Here comes a man who desperately needs my help: close."  "Huh?  I hear vicious birds upstairs?  Why don't I just explore the house alone?!"<br />Hitchcock overused the green/blue screen in this film.  I can understand using it in the scenes with the attacking birds, but for a quick boating trip across the bay?  It makes Hedren seem impossibly prissy.  "No, there's no way I'm going to actually get on a boat.  There might be some wind that would blow my hair onto my obnoxiously large forehead.  I'll just sit here in the studio."<br />I think I was more upset that this movie didn't have a point than that it didn't have an ending, although that didn't help things.  It doesn't take a genius to write a story with a million loose ends; it takes a true genius to tie those all together in a believable storyline.<br />You can hyper-analyze this movie if you want and read into it all sorts of deeper meaning and how the bird attacks are symbolic of the women all fighting over Mitch, but I think that's going too far.  I think many times people read too much into films and turn them into something they're not.  (Though even if the attacks ARE a commentary on the relationship between Melanie and Mitch it still is not a poignant film-- it is too stilted, too wooden, too melodramatic.)  My advice: skip this one and watch Rear Window or The Man Who Knew Too Much instead.

Gorgeous video remastering without a blemish in sight and colors spot-on with a new 5.1 remixing of the original audio soundtrack. Concerning the movie itself, if you took all the dated clothes, dance styles, and music out of it, there really is a great coming-of-age/hard luck story in here that to me seemed timeless. I watched it with this version's new "70's Discopedia [aka subtitle trivia track]" and found it entertaining and very informative on facts of the era. This new version keeps the director commentary from the last DVD version, but now adds a new 56 minute documentary featuring most of it's actors (no Travolta, strange for him) today, including the Bee Gees and even Troma Horror producer favorite Lloyd Kaufman (who I had no idea was the film's location scout). But this already full DVD had two more related extras, a too-long "teach you to dance" with instructors and an animated version that replaces the "VH1 Special" and the 4 minutes of deleted scenes that the earlier release had. To lose those deleted scenes for that animated one was really stupid and not worth it, but whatcha gonna do. Also, the packaging is a tad odd, with a plastic slipcover surrounding a half-digipak of sorts that doesn't hold it in place very well, sliding out the second you hold it upright, but looking groovy nonetheless. Watching this today, I found it hard to believe I was actually alive during this time-period (be it in single-digits), but instantly it took me back to those days when my parents dressed me in those god-awful shirts and polyester slacks. A must own for any collector of time-period piece DVD's, and though it's case is a bit off, this version so far is the ultimate for any standard-definition home library.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:9.0/10)

 | product/productId: 0784011370 | review/userId: A23F0RW1RUBBDF | review/summary: Stallone's Second Best | review/text: The first being Rocky, this film is really good. For an action film, it really has depth in its characters. Stallone is a very underrated actor and this is one his best roles. He plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, who has not really adjusted to society after the war and snaps after being arrested for no reason at all. Brian Dennehy is great as the town sheriff who has a real mean streek to him. Richard Crenna is great as the colonel who trained Rambo who must help him before its too late. The screenplay cowritten by Stallone has some great moments including the radio conversation between Rambo and Trautman (Crenna). Also has a really documentary on making of the film. Too bad the sequel, like the Rocky ones, weren't as good. Highly Recommended.

(in the 50's) I loved them all but &quot;Maytime&quot; was my favorite.  I remember feeling really sad and being perplexed with my grandmother crying at the end of the movie.  I thought it was sad too but,,,,,. Then years later after my grandmother passed away i saw it again and saw what she saw in this film.  It was pure beauty, love, romance, tragidy and reunion of the spirit.  I have this film now and each time i watch it i think of that special time with my grandmother.  This film will always have that meaning for me and the song &quot;Sweethearts&quot; has always been my favorite song.  This might sound mushy to some people but i'm glad i have those wonderful memories of my grandmother thanks to this wonderful film.  Just one small piece of advise.  Have the tissues ready at the end.

This sets right off telling you "Not all aliens come from space." Gee...what could THIS be a rip-off of?<br /><br />The reviewer before me is pretty head-on about first impressions. I had high hopes for this movie first setting out - it had a good set-up, great sets, some good early suspense, and it looked to be an OK sci-fi film. Then they show you the "alien." Yes, they hold the suspense for a few good seconds before going, "Here ya go." Then the rest of the film is the alien killing off the crew bit by bit (which isn't terribly hard since twice they gang attack it IN THE WATER with WEAK WEAPONS). It then is killed by electrical shock in the water...only to come back a few minutes later as if nothing happened. *sigh* Don't you ever feel like so many monster films were inspired by that classic Holy Grail quote? You know, when John Cleese stammers: "I got better!"<br /><br />The monster design I guess was OK. I mean, heck its huge and its a fish, what can we expect? It's unique looking, but since we see it full body from the very beginning it loses its scariness from the get-go. It coming back after - you know, dying - was also annoying and cliche.<br /><br />If you're going to watch it, watch the first half hour or so. Once the monster's shown, just turn it off. You can probably guess who lives and who dies. And since the alien survival rate in movies is very low, you can probably guess what happens to our good friend Mister Guppy.

And, I love the new Janson Media DVD<br />(Collector's Edition) of  "The Impossible Spy" because it includes many important  "extras" such as critic's reviews,<br />trailer, and an on-location report  featuring behind-the-scenes interviews  with the stars, John Shea and Eli Wallach about what it is like to be a spy. Also, there's a very good photo gallery, star filmographies, and a time-line of all<br />the major Arab-Israel conflicts that led up to Elie Cohen's incredible mission, and  how vital it was for the outcome of the June 1967 Six-Day War.<br /><br />The story is exciting and compelling. It's about an Israeli agent who was sent  to Syria, via Argentina, in the 1960's and  was so successful in infiltrating the Syrian  High Command, that he was nominated to  be their Deputy Defense Minister--and 3rd in line for the Presidency. Unbelievable. And, all true.

It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene (minus the above antics), and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through.  I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you. But I don't think the movie would've been good without him.

Literally, there is nothing quite like it. Adam Sandler lights up the screen in his role as an unintentionally charming wedding singer. The  story never gets dull; it's funny and easy watch throughout. And the  likeable characters (and DISlikeable ones--&quot;Mr. Gulia&quot;) add to  the film's viewer-friendliness. This is without a doubt the highlight of  Sandler's career.
 | product/productId: 5558725745 | review/userId: A1YHRSRYBCHZ8L | review/summary: Great Acting but it finds a hard time to get to that Happy Ending. | review/text: starring Lisa Kudrow, Tom Arnold (in a very suprising performance) and one of my favorite actresses Maggie Gyllenhaal in one of her best performances. The film itself goes in all directions telling three different strories that involve all the players indirectly then directly and then back. The film lacks depth in some areas and gets kinda depressing (Using subtitles instead of having a narrator was kinda unique). But the perfomances from Kudrow, Arnold, Jason Ritter (John's kid) and Gyllenhaal make it a real gem.

It is a set piece, a very restricted musical, but it is still fun. I don't think there is another movie quite like it. The costuming and sets look really good on our large screen TV. The musical itself is a glimpse of a past farther back--the 1900s--than the glimpse of the past--1962--served up with 2010 technology. Cool.
 | product/productId: 6302353750 | review/userId: A1TAWJ2PA3USVX | review/summary: Maybe You Have to Live It to Appreciate It | review/text: In "Blood on the Sun," James Cagney plays an expat newspaper editor who discovers Japan's plot for world domination.  Made in 1945, the film is a bully piece of wartime propaganda--but it also has surprising depth.  It isn't PC, but it's not all stereotype either.  There are some real Asians in the film, the plot is a true story, and not all the Japanese are evil.  That said, yes, there are a lot of quasi-offensive squinty-eyed caucasians with fake buck teeth in the film, too.<br /><br />Cagney does a very good job as the editor.  A bundle of self-assured energy, as ever, he nonetheless adds depth by trying to speak a bit of Japanese and Mandarin, and by doing some very credible judo.  Matter of fact, his judo coach was LAPD's Jack Halloran, who also took a role in this flick and went on to become a regular Hollywood character actor!<br /><br />The movie is filmed almost entirely in sets at the studio, which is unsurprising.  Nevertheless, it looks fairly good.  In fact, the "expat bar" set is a faithful reproduction of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed bar at the old Imperial Hotel in Tokyo!<br /><br />Cagney was just coming off an Oscar and just out of contract with WB Studios.  Here, he and his brother produced, and they did a decent job.  In short, the films hold up.  Not a major classic, but an exciting potboiler!  And as a correction to various reviewers, the film takes place neither in "post-WWII Japan" nor "The 1920's" but in the 30's.<br /><br />As a personal aside, I served many years as a US diplomat in Communist China--another ruthless east Asian dictatorship.  Maybe some other viewers will find the Japanese officials in Blood on the Sun to be too fake, smarmy, and banal.  I found them pretty realistic!

He builds the franchise well as Taylor the self-absorbed commander reduced to animal in a cage.  He plays the role well but has plenty of help.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall (one of the most underrated actors who have been)and Maurce Evans do their best to steal the show.  (Particularly Evans who's proves the screen presence of a great stage actor cuts through any amount of makeup.  The passion and interaction of the characters as they argue their cases mirrors the arguements of the times which is one of the movie's strengths.  Well shot and quite a spectacle considering the scale of the movie.  The franchise that follows never comes to this level and the amount of parody it has spawned doesn't cut it.  But this one is a winner.  It only remains to see if the remake can match it.

But sadly Disney ruined this classic by re-dubbing it with the fannings.  I would much rather pay $20 more for the fox original dubbing which is what most of us over the age of 20 grew up with.  If you have never seen totoro then this will still be an amazing piece to your collection.

This is Madonna in her best times as a singer and entertainment. The production is very good if you compare it for the time that was made (1987) so with that in mind you can enjoy this concert. I like it because she sings a lot of the songs that made her famous like Into the Groove, Material Girl, Papa don't Preach etc. I recommend it for fans of that time and new ones if they want to know who Madonna really was.
 | product/productId: 0783225733 | review/userId: A2VP7JOT3K7PFM | review/summary: Houston, we have a GREAT MOVIE here.  Do you copy? | review/text: +++++<br /><br />This movie is a dramatized version of the real life near-tragedy of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Apollo 13 was the third mission to land men on the Moon and the Apollo program's first aborted mission.  An explosion in one of the oxygen tanks crippled the spacecraft during flight.  The Lunar Module (used only to land on the Moon) was used to provide emergency propulsion and life support after the loss of the service module system.  The crew was forced to just orbit the Moon and return to Earth.<br /><br />Here are the facts of the Apollo 13 (AS-508) mission:<br /><br />(1) Lunar Module: Aquarius<br />(2) Command and Service Module: Odyssey<br />(3) Crew: Commander Jim Lovell, Command Module pilot Jack Swigert**, Lunar Module pilot: Fred Haise<br />(4) Launch: April 11, 1970<br />(5) Landing site: near Fra Mauro (one of the Moon's craters)<br />(6) Returned to Earth: April 17, 1970<br /><br />** The initial pilot Tom Mattingly was removed 72 hours prior to launch due to presumed exposure to German measles.  (He later flew on Apollo 16.)<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has taken these bare facts (and the book "Lost Moon" co-authored by Jim Lovell who served as technical consultant on this movie) and made an unforgettable adventure, drama, and history movie using state-of-the-art special effects and ingenious movie-making techniques.<br /><br />There are actually three stories in this movie:<br /><br />(1) The astronauts struggle to stay alive<br />(2) The controlled chaos at NASA who try to solve the numerous problems caused by the explosion<br />(3) The trauma faced by the astronaut's families<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as Mission Control Director Gene Kranz give especially good performances.  Also look for the fine performance of Gary Sinise as bumped astronaut Ken Mattingly.  Ron Howard does not make the mistake of letting the special effects upstage these terrific performances.  (Ron Howard's real-life mother also has a role in this movie.)<br /><br />Another highlight of this movie is the actual historical news footage that was used.  Look for people like Neil Armstrong (the first person to set foot on the Moon in July, 1969) as well as Jim and Marilyn Lovell among this footage.<br /><br />The movie ends with Hanks as Lovell summarizing the "seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13" and he ends his summary with this statement:<br /><br />"I look up at the Moon and wonder when we will be going back and who will that be?"<br /><br />Finally, the anniversary edition DVD is flawless with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.  The most notable extra is that the entire movie is also presented in IMAX.<br /><br />In conclusion, be sure to see this incredible movie and see why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture!!<br /><br />(1995;  2 hr 20 min;  widescreen;  2 discs)<br /><br />+++++
 | product/productId: 0782002064 | review/userId: A3SFO2GSP5CVSM | review/summary: Masterpiece | review/text: At its center, the film works because we all have wondered what would the world be like if we were never born. Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level.... This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.
 | product/productId: 0790733420 | review/userId: APDMVBRLIBCZV | review/summary: A suitcase full of trouble and a film full of great performances | review/text: "True Romance" is a very good film, but it did not recieve the acclaim it should have (and eventually did) when it premiered in 1993. Only on video (and now on dvd) did "True Romance" really find it's audience and especially after the world wide acclaim of the now classic "Pulp Fiction" in 1994 did many people discover this gem of a script by Quentin Tarantino [which was Tarantino's first completed script]. Tony Scott (Top Gun, Revenge) directs this film, as mostly all of his films, with a lot of face-paced, colorful style. But here he shows his passion for it's story and especially the main characters of Clarence and Alabama as he follows them on their romantic and dangerous journey together.<br /><br />Clarence and Alabama are portrayed by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, who make an excellent couple in this film. Clarence is a lonely comic book store clerk who meets Alabama, a free-spirited call girl. They fall in love and get married, however, thoughts of Alabama's now ex-pimp, Drexyl (Gary Oldman) is nawing at Clarence's conscience deciding whether or not he should kill him. Indeed, he does kill Drexyl, and in the process, unknowingly takes the wrong suitcase which turns out to be filled with cocaine. Clarence and Alabama plan to sell the cocaine, take the money and run, but little do they know that the mobsters who that suitcase of cocaine belongs to and the cops desperate for a bust are after them.<br /><br />Along the way are a suitcase full of supporting actors including Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, Christopher Walken as the mob boss and James Gandolfini as his brutal henchman, Michael Rappaport as Clarence's best friend Dick Ritchie, Brad Pitt as Dick's very laid back roommate, Val Kilmer as Clarence's mentor (Elvis), Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as the vice cops, Bronson Pinchott as an actor and middle man for a Hollywood producer (Saul Rubinek) interested in buying Clarence and Alabama's cocaine. All of these supporting performances are great and work very well with Tarantino's unique dialogue with the exception of Brad Pitt as Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate. Pitt (early in his career) adds a lot more to this 'cameo' character than Tarantino's script, and he does it very well.<br /><br />This film is romantic and violent at the same time contrasting "Bonnie and Clyde" which was violent but not romantic. Clarence and Alabama are two people deeply in love who walk into a dangerous oppportunity and they take it together. "True Romance" is funny, dark, intense, romantic, and it's done well.<br /><br />Two-Disc Special Edition dvd: 5 stars / I really enjoyed the special features on this dvd especially the writer's commentary by Quentin Tarantino which offers a lot of insight and background information about the writing and selling of the script. Unlike many director and writer commentaries, Tarantino's commentary is interesting and entertaining making you feel like he is your friend watching the film with you. On the second disc is an enjoyable selected commentary given by actor Michael Rappaport who offers a lot of behind-the-scenes info on his scenes, and he is genuinely funny on this commentary too. Also included on the second disc is the original ending from Tarantino's script. I have mixed feelings about the original ending, but I love that director Tony Scott shot it, and it is included on this dvd along with several deleted and extended scenes. This is an excellent Special Edition dvd.
 | product/productId: 6300271560 | review/userId: APLKS02DQDUNK | review/summary: This is just a fantastic movie! | review/text: About a month ago, myself and three classmates of mine had to watch this film for our end-of-the-year movie assignment in our U.S. History class. It gives me great pleasure to say that this film blew us all away.<br /><br />The film, in essence, is really two stories that remain largely unrelated: the first half is the story of Chuck Yeager, the Air Force test pilot who was the first to break the sound barrier; the second half is the story of the first seven astronauts and the struggles they faced. Philip Kaufman wisely chose to combine both films into one very long movie, as the connections between the two parts are extremely contrasting, but are correlated in very subtle but prominent ways.<br /><br />In the first film, Sam Shepard brings a quiet yet extremely likeable personality to the character of Chuck Yeager, a man who understands the heroism of his role but remains humbled by it and also by the people who surround him, especially his wife (played wonderfully by Barbara Hershey). The very beginning of this segment immediately connects the viewer to the challenges of the test pilot and shows how it affects Yeager and those around him. Yeager handles it all with a nonchalant yet sincerely-acknowledging attitude that is undoubtedly my favorite role in the movie.<br /><br />The second portion of the movie documents the story of the first American astronauts (who all embodied "The Right Stuff") and the challenges they faced within the face of the government and the Cold War as well as the American press and public. Among the seven astronauts, Dennis Quaid brings an extremely arrogant presence to Gordon "Hot Dog" Cooper (he performs this role so well I couldn't help but grin every time he spoke). Ed Harris brings a sturdy and professional attitude to the most famous of the seven, John Glenn, that is award-worthy. Scott Glenn portrays the first American in space, Alan Shepard, with a dutiful attitude towards his mission.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the interweaving of these stories combine for a complete understanding of the innovations of this time period. These two connected stories, along with occasional airflight or spaceflight sequences (these scenes being backed by a fantastic orchestral soundtrack that won an Academy Award, and rightfully so) and real NASA and USAF footage, combine for a whopping 193 minutes that is thick in detail and passion. This is a fantastic film that captures all sides of a prominent time in American history.

 | product/productId: 0790736918 | review/userId: A1L43KWWR05PCS | review/summary: QUINTESSENTIAL CLASSIC WESTERN... | review/text: This film, directed by the legendary John Ford and starring John Wayne in the leading role, is a western that has achieved mythic proportions. Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers, and Ethan joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was massacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.<br /><br />Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have "gone Injun".<br /><br />The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma.<br /><br />Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol from whom Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.<br /><br />Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.

Despite this movie having an absurd plot,  largely unlikable characters, particularly Charlie's family, and repetitive singing from the loompas, this is a fantastic movie. But wilder and the boy who plays charlie are the ones who really makes this movie a classic. ill leave the explanation of whats in this movie to the editors and other reviewers.<br /><br />the reason for the 1 star deduction is because of the transfer quality. some scenes are quite bad. such as the sketchiness of when charlie runs home after finding the golden ticket. since its been ages since i've last seen this movie i have no idea if anything was removed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good buy. They're are interviews with cast and directors included on this too which makes even more valuable.
 | product/productId: 0783211856 | review/userId: A3C1JP82J0ACEY | review/summary: Class Movie Review | review/text: Schindlers list is about a German man named Oscar Schindler. He was a very wealthy business man. During the Holocaust when the Nazis reigned, he grew more aware of the terrible deaths that awaited the Jewish people. He decided to open a factory and he hired many Jewish people who most likely did not have a chance at life. People say that he opened this factory to hire Jews for cheap labor. If this theory is true, he had quite the change of heart. He did anything in his power to save as many of the Jewish people that he could. It is known that he saved about 1100 Jewish people. He devised a list of names of all the Jewish people he had encountered during this time period and that one list saved 1100 Jewish people from death. Unfortunately at the end of the movie, Oscar Schindler still did not feel like he did much of anything. He was extremely upset that he could not do more, that he could not save more peoples lives.  This movie in my opinion was heartbreaking but it was also heartwarming to see the good he did for the lives of those people.<br />This movie has a lot to do with world religions because during this time period, the Nazis were killing Jewish people because of their religion. The Nazis blamed the Jews for all of the things that went wrong in the world and said it was because the Jewish people were not Christians. It is terrible to know that such horrific things happened to innocent people because they did not practice the same religions. This is why I like the idea of coexisting. Obviously people did not coexist during this gruesome time period, but looking back at these events today, people have learned more about tolerance of other peoples religions.

The fact that the main character played by Lew Ayres became a pacifist during WW II is a statement of the impact that it made on his life.

The scope of the film is, well, Shakespearean. Even its few flaws are writ large in 70mm.<br /><br />So, how about a DVD? Is there some law that says, "This film is a milestone, so let's let it languish on VHS"?<br /><br />Are you listening, Hollywood?
 | product/productId: 6301651715 | review/userId: A13BINCE63U4HN | review/summary: absolution | review/text: One of cinema history's most tragic examples of a filmmaker who never lived up to his promise, Yanagimachi's &quot;Himatsuri&quot; is a burning, haunting experience. Combining obscure imagery and Shinto references along with odd, bold leaps in tone the director crafts a singular and astounding work illuminating the disasterous results of man's severing his ties with nature. Taking a true life inexplicable murder/suicide in a remote Japanese fishing community as its platform, Yanamiguchi creates a fusion of image, sound and montage (coupled with Toru Takemitsu's chillingly primal score) that shows a real mastery of film form. But &quot;Himatsuri&quot; is not just form without content: beneath it all lies a message that is still very relevant as society progresses forward towards its digital future. A bonified masterpiece, there's never been anything quite like it.

 | product/productId: 0783223145 | review/userId: A1774QEPCFMKEX | review/summary: Fantasy Masquerading as Reality | review/text: Of course the acting, directing, cinematography, etc. of this movie are all, by near universal consensus (and I don't exclude myself), simply first-rate. The main point of disagreement seems to be how necessary those VERY slow wedding scenes were to setting the backdrop for the rest of the movie.<p>My rejection of the movie as a thing of worth is based on one specific element: the Russian roulette scenes.<p>When I saw the movie, I was extremely moved, indeed haunted, by as much as, if not more than, anything else in the movie, the Russian roulette scenes. They are so powerful: de Niro's character helping the others pull through, the daring escape, their effect on Walken's character, who by the end of the movie is completely emotionally numbed/scarred by them, etc.<p>The movie portrayed these scenes so convincingly, and my own personal knowledge of the Vietnam war was sufficiently sparse, that I took it for granted, without even a second thought, that these scenes portrayed a phenomenon that was a legitimate part of the Vietnam War experience. And the thought that this was another of the horrors that U.S. soldiers had to face was very disturbing to me and lasted with me for a long time.<p>I found out years later that the Russian roulette scenes were a total fantasy, a fiction, a fake, a fabrication. That such scenes rarely, if ever, took place in the Vietnam War.<p>So what is the message of this movie? How I am supposed to treat seriously a movie which takes such pains to build up a realistic group of characters, sent to a horrible war that really did take place, come back and have to deal with real-life situations of apple-pie America, when a central pillar of the experience of the movie is total fantasy-land?<p>It is as if, instead of having the Russian roulette scenes, the movie had portrayed the soldiers being abducted by UFO's for a time, and showing the impact such an episode would have on them. Sound ridiculous? Of course it is! But therefore so too is inter-weaving a bizarre, surrealistic experience of Russian roulette, which bears no more relation to reality than a UFO escapade.<p>I object to the deception. I seriously doubt that I am the only person who was thus misled by the movie. It is simply lazy and manipulative to concoct such a fictitious scenario. Russian roulette, a forced game where the stakes are life and death and the outcome is dictated by the roll of the dice (so to speak), is a cheap, easy, artificial way to inject a sense of morbid tension and high drama into the movie.<p>If the movie-makers wanted to show us a movie which portrays the horrors of the Vietnam War, then please show us a movie which portrays the horrors of the Vietnam War! not a movie which portrays the horrors of your imagination! Was there not enough material of what the U.S. soldiers went through in Vietnam that you had to fabricate this Russian roulette nonsense?<p>I see one reviewer after another speak of the "realism" of this movie. In light of what I've written here, I just don't get it.

I have had it on VHS for years, waiting for it to come out on DVD, to replace the VHS copy I have. However if you previously purchased the first release from Goodtimes Home Video, DON'T waste your money on this 'so-called' newer release.<br /><br />Other than the picture on the box, this 'newer' release from Universal is no different than the original release of this title from Goodtimes Home Video!<br /><br />The Product Details 'fails' to mention that this Universal release in the Full Frame Format, just like the version from Goodtimes Home Video. It also 'fails' to state that the Universal release is in 'Mono' just as the release from Goodtimes Home Video. So what's the difference? Both are Full Frame, both are in Mono, which the Product Description fails to mention. The only difference is the picture on the box!<br /><br />In one of the reviews I read, it stated, "This movie was previously avalable from Goodtimes Home Video in Full Screen Format. As this release is from Universal Studios we can only hope it will be released in it's Original Aspect Ratio."<br /><br />Well it wasn't! And again, the Product description failed to state this! Also the new release from Universal, just as the release from Goodtimes Home Video, didn't add any additional menu features included on the DVD. So again, what is the difference? They are the same exact DVD, packaged in two different boxes, with the exception that the Goodtimes release is in the 'snap' type box and the Universal is in the 'clamshell' type box.

Sure the film lacks some logic and sense in some parts, but its not enough to drive you away from enjoying the movie. Very stylish directing by Lamberto Bava and superb special effects! Gore junkies will not be disappointed. The head bangin' soundtrack is also great. One can't resist to get rocked as the hero is riding a motorcycle through the theater lopping heads off of demons with a sword while Accept's Fast as a Shark is blastin' in the background. A truely memorable scene! The ending is also superb! So don't hesitate to pick up this film; it's one hell of a ride! One of the best and most entertaining horror films to be imported from Italy!

 | product/productId: 0790744546 | review/userId: AYUFQY3XG4ZBR | review/summary: Fantastic "guy movie" with an amazing ensemble cast. | review/text: Barry Levinson has made a number of films that are both critically acclaimed and really enjoyable...but "Diner" is the one I always come back to when I need an example of a finely crafted movie that appears to be wholly natural (i.e., no one would ever assume that the cast was ever "acting").<p>Every actor in this film was in the early stage of their big screen career when this movie was made; every one went on to a sustained level of success.  Mickey Rourke became one of the hottest actors of the 1980's, Kevin Bacon went from minor support roles to leading man status, Paul Reiser's stand-up comedy took off and he eventually found his way to the successful TV series "Mad About You" after (most peculiarly) landing a role as a heavy corporate slimeball in "Aliens".  And Steve Guttenberg became a significant enough personality to land a role with Tom Selleck and Ted Danson in "Three Men and a Baby" before the decade was done (where he's gone since then is anyone's guess).<p>Ellen Barkin shoulders the thankless burden of being the lone female character surrounded by very well-defined male characters in a brilliant job of ensemble casting, and she is more than up to the task.  Not being "one of the guys", she is eternally the outsider looking in...yet being married to (and apparently an ex-girlfriend of) "one of the guys" keeps her connected, ambiguously at best, to a circle she is doomed never to fully understand.<p>That's because this movie is about "the guys" and what it means to be "one of the guys".  Character development is very well-executed; the actors throw themselves into their roles and present well-rounded (and uniquely flawed) young men that any one of us may have known (or been) at that same stage in our own lives.  Friends who have grown up together and are in the process of growing apart, not quite understanding the depth of responsibility that comes with adulthood.<p>All of that aside, the dialogue in this movie, particularly in the scenes in the diner itself (apparently improvised to a significant degree) really make this movie worth watching.  Quentin Tarantino couldn't write such believable casual exchanges between good friends.  It all seems to flow so naturally; these are conversations you could hear (or have) anywhere with your friends.  It's "Sex In The City" 20 years ahead of its time, focused from the mens' point of view.  A terrific soundtrack and a stunning collection of vintage automobiles (especially Kevin Bacon's old Triumph TR2) round out a thoroughly satisfying period piece which is timeless enough to have taken place anywhere at anytime.  You don't have to have grown up in the 1950's to appreciate a character study this good.

 | product/productId: 6301948335 | review/userId: A1ERUWNYZ93NRR | review/summary: Nothing Sacred Here! | review/text: This is by far one of the most offensive, off-color, anti-organized-religion films ever made... and so it stands to reason it's at the top of my favorites list. Tim Curry's portrayal of a tv evangelist is a top-notch performance, with a supporting cast that's every bit as good.  Annie Potts plays the Reverend's sincerely supporting wife who likes to dress us as Biblical characters and put on skits for the congregation in various states of undress... but all in the name of the lord.<br /><br />When Bill Paxton and crew visit the Tower of Bethlehem with the intent to rob Reverend Ray of some of that cash his tv congregation pledges to the "call girls", all Hell breaks loose and it's pure heaven in entertainmnt for anyone who can appreciate an irreverent sense of humor.  And in fact, there's a one-liner in the film that had me choking for an hour.  "They're gonna..."  Heh.  I won't spoil it.  Ya need to rent it or buy it on eBay or borrow it from a friend.  That one line alone is worth whatever you'll pay for the VHS.<br /><br />I don't know why this film isn't avalable on DVD - quite possibly because it offended every religious fanatic who thinks those tv evangelist programs are real.  (Yup, professional wrestling is real, too, my friends).<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing sacred about Pass the Ammo, and that is a large part of its charm.
 | product/productId: 6302078075 | review/userId: A1HX00DL0SZM1G | review/summary: Easy to recommend war movie | review/text: Taking place in World War I is the James Cagney-Dan Dailey drama "What Price Glory" made in 1952 by the legendary director John Ford. Essentially the movie is a classic love triangle story set against the backdrop of the ravaged French countryside of 1918. Cagney plays the part of Capt. Flagg, a commander in charge of a ragtag group of conscripts who must rely on the brash and disrespectful Sgt. Quirt to whip them into shape. Trouble brews though when Flagg and Quirt both fall for the same girl. The movie is a triumph for all concerned both in strong performances from the actors (including a young Robert Wagner) and a technical masterpiece from the crew. The same cannot be honestly said for the DVD. Although the picture and sound are both acceptable the quality of the overall print shows some wear and there are noticeable fluctuations in the color balance. Still for such a low price it is a title that is easy to recommend.

 | product/productId: 1572525320 | review/userId: A2ZHB7E544QLLQ | review/summary: Truffaut at his best | review/text: Franois Truffaut is one of those enigmatic directors who is not easily definable, but his works are among the best the film industry has ever offered. Along that line, "The 400 Blows" stands up there as one of his best. The woeful tale of Antoine, cast off by his parents and scorned by his teachers, is a remarkable one and the then-young Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud gives a powerful performance as the teenage Parisian caught up in a world not to his liking.<br /><br />"The 400 Blows" was the first in a series that Truffaut made with L&eacute;aud and I look forward to seeing the others. The eerie score is mesmerizing and the scenes shot from curious angles give the film a surreal look, albeit a terrific cinematographical one. I highly recommend "The 400 Blows"...Truffaut has made a masterpiece.
 | product/productId: 6302405939 | review/userId: A1PG52XYY4PCUA | review/summary: opinion on "europa europa" | review/text: I felt that the movie was good because it was a good story and it portrayed what was happening in the third reich well. By watching the movie, the audience is able to understand what life was like for a Jew trying to escape from presecution, what being in a Russian and German school during world war 2 was like, and what it felt like to be fighting for Nazi Germany. It showed how the war was not really against Russia or the Allies but against the Jews which they felt were an inferior race. The movie shows how a Jewish boy, whom according to Nazi ideology is inferior, survives and becaome German hero. The message behind the movie is that there is nothing to back up Nazi ideology and that there is no such thing as an inferior race because the Jews whom they thought of as inferior was successful in a German school.
 | product/productId: 6301971272 | review/userId: A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z | review/summary: Random thoughts on an old favorite | review/text: The original American theatrical trailer for Sergio Leone's classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Italy/Spain/W Germany-1966) has Eli Wallach as the Bad and Lee Van Cleef the Ugly, while the film reverses these. Practically all three leads are interchangeable, as Clint Eastwood's character, mysteriously nicknamed "Blondie," is certainly a bad guy, plus after his desert ordeal, he's quite ugly (for a while).<br /><br />A bit overlong at 162 minutes, yet there would be little fat to trim here (perhaps the bridge sequence?) if cuts had to be made.<br /><br />Saw this in first run a very long time ago. With the advent of home video in the '80s I've been able to reexperience it umpteen times since. During the most recent viewing, I looked beyond familiar characters, plot and dialogue and studied other details, such as camera panning during Eli Wallach's worried search for a gravemarker while Ennio Morricone's magnificent "Ecstasy of Gold" plays, also Leone's timing of facial closeups and quick edits during the climactic three-way cemetery showdown. That all these guys are grimy, sweaty, unwashed and unshaven is certainly accurate for an age and place where fresh laundry and bathtubs could be few and far between.<br /><br />Although filmed in Spain, backgrounds suit the American West nicely. How much of the Civil War was fought in this country's more arid areas is a legitimate question.<br /><br />Morricone's main theme is heard throughout, always in variation. As a very amateur musician and singer who favors harmony, bassline structure and counterpoint to melody, an almost-syncopated downscale string countermelody in this piece, especially as Eastwood gallops off at the end, is a real attention grabber. It's an inspired bit of orchestration, at least for me.<br /><br />Few movies stand up to the scrutiny of repeated viewings as well as this one, and not many American westerns have ever been as good. Bad and/or ugly, maybe.

After first reading the plot on IMDb I actually thought this film would be kind of cheesy, but after watching it for the first time I thought it was awesome. The best part had to be the ending. I thought it was one of the strongest endings of any film, and certaintly the strongest of any scifi ending. It has an amazing cast including Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. It was also gory and almost disturbing which I found suprising. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel which was directed by this film's special effects artist. 5 stars.

This is the best WWII submarine movie I have seen. If you want to get the best  authenticity, opt for the German language with English subtitles. It gives the movie more realism. From beginning to end it accurately showed the conditions that these men went through. The bordom, the restlessness, to panic stricken fear.  The only drawbacks the film suffers in,is the depth charge scenes, and the lack of more enemy engagement. The depth charge scenes were the same scene repeated over and over again. Apparently the exact same shot was used for the depth charge scenes,and not well done. I also expected a little more battle scenes in an over three hour movie. Still it is an outstanding movie, that anyone that likes WWII movies, will enjoy.

 | product/productId: 630218021X | review/userId: A3FBAXZJFJX0Y | review/summary: Russell's Tchaikovsky | review/text: This over the top Tchaikovsky biopic is a feast for the eyes and ears. Based on the actual memoirs of Catherine Drinker Bowen it tells in highly exagerated terms the story of Tchaikovsky and his battle with his homosexuality.  Few movies mix music and visuals as well as this one does. Richard Chamberlain is a hunk of a Tchaikovsky-men or women would fall for him-and Glenda Jackson remains serenly calm as she spirals into madness until she finally realizes what she knew all along-"He never loved me!!"<br />The music of Tchaikovsky is adapted so perfectly to the film it is hard to imagine some of these scenes any other way. The train scene where Tchaikovsky is visually assaulted by a naked Glenda Jackson to the strains of the "Pathetique" and "Manfred" symphomies is a harrowing experience, as is the final sequence where Tchaikovsky is dragged from his bed to a scalding bath as a cure for his cholera.<br />But the real reason for my writing this review is this: WHY ISN'T THIS FILM ON DVD? This is one film that would certainly benefit from a widescreen presentation. I did see a widescreen presentation in television in Montreal, so somewhere one exists. Where is it?<br />Here's hoping that someone sees this and forwards it to the right people so we can get the copy of this film we deserve.

I didn't really like Richard Burton as Alexander. He over acted some parts too much and some parts not enough. I liked watching the guy who plays Philip much more. He seemed to really get into his character and made him work for the time that he was in the film.<br /><br />The battle scenes are anemic compared to what we're used to today and even for that time I think left a bit to be desired in that realm. The dialogue could be a bit silly in places and odd in some other parts.<br /><br />I would say, and this had it going for it, it's no worse than the modern version of Alexander with Colin Farrell. To me it seems like Stone watched this movie and only updated it instead of revamping it.

 | product/productId: 0790737728 | review/userId: A325RX5G80KA7Z | review/summary: A Campy Classic | review/text: This movie is nothing but fun. I have watched it at least 80 times, if not more. My laserdisc copy is almost worn out, and my VHS copies of this have seen better days, too. I would LOVE to see a deluxe version of this movie on DVD. Widescreen, with one B/W version and the original Color version. I know that a DVD with the color version would sell tremendously well. There are a lot of Prince fans that would buy it. That being said, everytime I watch this movie, I notice something different about it, that I never noticed before. Since the part that is supposed to be serious is not, it gives you the viewer a guaranteed chance to laugh and be lighthearted. Knowing some of the strange things that Prince has done over the years, you can't help but wonder if that wasn't exactly his intention. To make a comedy , a parody, if you will, of the overly dramatic movies in the 20's and 30's. I think it is well done, and even non Prince fans would enjoy it, if they realize going in that it is a parody. A Fun diversion.
 | product/productId: 0790732491 | review/userId: A23OM1KR4F4RTT | review/summary: Worst Movie Ever Made | review/text: This is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life.  I was obsessed with Batman enough to see it more than once and confirm the fact that this was just a terrible movie.  I know this isnt coming off constructive, but anyone who has seen this film knows what I'm talking about.  Joel Schumacher is a great director... infact, one of my favorites.  Batman?  Not the film for him.  I wish they had ended his riegn of terror with Batman Forever.  Though, Batman Forever was no where near this terrible... I saw it coming... there were signs like neon lights everywhere, overexaggerated landscapes, nipple on the batsuit, Robin, Batmobile scaling wall, and especially the poor story line.  As I watched Batman Forever, I knew that it was only a matter of time before Batman clapped his boots together to activate his ice skates.  I hope Warner Bros have learned their lesson and follow a more successful path with the Batman Begins sequels.
 | product/productId: 6300250644 | review/userId: A1ZS82R4RC0I2N | review/summary: Artsy Fartsy | review/text: &quot;Fool For Love&quot; is based on a Sam Shepard`s play, and the movie`s leads are Shepard himself and Kim Basinger as a married couple who face an identity crisis and must overcome their differences in order to be unite again or disjointed forever. While the idea is promising and the first minutes intriguing, it soon turns into a pretensious, lifeless, slow and unfinishable picture. What could have been an interesting piece about love, guilt, dysfunction and desire becomes a sucession of empty dialogs, wooden monologues and tepid flashbacks that fail to engage. Director Robert Altman sure wasted a good opportunity with this snoozer. Avoid.

 | product/productId: 5559375241 | review/userId: A210NI3I6Y4ZMO | review/summary: Excellent idea, slow in the telling. | review/text: This movie was one of the slowest moving films I've ever seen, and the slow pace ultimately brings the viewer to a surprise twist ending but by that point you're so glad the movie is over you could care less about the premise. Boring characters, except the lead girl, she was the only saving grace in the film, and the only convincing character. That's my opinion. Not a horrible movie, but certainly not what it was hyped to be in the previews and commercials. It's not what you might expect. Certainly not the chiller that is promised in the advertisements.

 | product/productId: 6301815785 | review/userId: AYCJSA9HR7TKO | review/summary: Shadow and light as stars | review/text: Eisenstein's "Ivan the Terrible" is a visual experience not to be missed.  The acting's not anything to write home about.  Nikolai Cherkasov's portrayal of Ivan is so overdone that his extravagant gestures remind one of the silent film variety.  Nor is the script a particularly good one.  The two parts of the film are a bit disjointed.<br /><br />But what IS excellent is the cinematography.  It's not wide of the mark to say that the real stars of the film are the shadows and light.  In this first part, we get a breathtaking preview of just what Eisenstein is capable of in the scene of the poisoned tsarina's funeral bier.  Ivan's profile is situated in front of candlesticks in such a way as to suggest not only incredible loneliness but also destiny.  We also see glimmers of the huge shadows cast by tiny humans trick that will dominate the second part.  It's all really quite incredible.<br /><br />Plot-wise, the first part of "Ivan the Terrible" sets the stage for Ivan's on-going power struggle with the boyars, the traditional aristocracy.  It begins at his coronation, details the connivances of the boyars, led by Ivan's own aunt (a character that is especially one-dimensional), features Ivan's war against the Kazars, and crescendos with the poisoning of his beloved wife Anastasia.  The emphasis throughout is the need for strong centralized leadership if the Russian Empire is to be saved from enemies east and west.  Stalin loved it.

 | product/productId: 0972179526 | review/userId: A32S9I7V8UHT7U | review/summary: Pretty helpful! | review/text: The most useful thing we got from Happiest Baby on the Block is the swaddling. Our baby LOVES to be swaddled. She can be in the middle of a total meltdown and as soon as I start swaddling her, she calms right down. The sshh'ing is also helpful. She never really liked the side jiggling or even taking a pacifier, which we use as a last resort when she's really upset.<br /><br />One other thing I really like about HBOTB is the attention it gives to a brand new baby. I fully belive in the 4th trimester theory. By mimmicking the feel and sounds of mama's tummy, the baby feels safe, warm, and comfortable. Knowing I could provide that environment outside the womb for my little baby was very comforting to me as a new mom, especially since our baby was so fussy during her first 6-8 weeks.
 | product/productId: 630194464X | review/userId: AP6L54VTCJKCQ | review/summary: 5 star for the movie - 1 for presentation | review/text: I just finished watching this movie last night for the first time in more than 20 years. This movie is one of the most powerful experiences form my childhood. I remember seeing this in theaters 20+ years ago - the movie even had a prologue with the author's meeting with Lincoln and the president's assassination. Widescreen was so much better than what we are offered on tape. In some instances we have to wait a few seconds for a talking person to appear on screen while on widescreen we would not have to wait at all.<br />This movie was filmed in Yugoslavia. I wish I had the soundtrack - especially for the Jericho and Mississippi songs.

 | product/productId: 0968941427 | review/userId: A3M5UGU0NGD38D | review/summary: M IS FOR MASTERFUL | review/text: It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that Fritz Lang's M from 1931 is one of the cinema's greatest treasures. This meticulous study of a pathological child murderer who is sought by both the authorities and the underworld is still chilling even after 80 years. Lang's  compelling visual style comes through in each frame as both factions of society close in on the elusive serial killer.<br /><br />Peter Lorre's arresting, star making performance is really the forerunner of every movie psychotic that followed. The concept of generating sympathy for such a heinous character is just as daring now as it was then, and Lorre brilliantly embodies the psychosis of a child/man doomed with a pre-disposed inclination for murder.<br /><br />Criterion's Blu-ray edition of this famous classic is a joy to behold. The clarity of the black and white image is beautiful and razor sharp, with consistently fine grain resolution that replicates 35mm film. There's a few instances of minimal wear inherent in the source print, which is understandable for a film of this vintage. The crisp monaural sound reproduction makes us appreciate even better Lang's innovative use of the technology which only arrived four years prior to M.<br /><br />The array of extras include an intelligent commentary by Anton Kaes and Eric Rentschler, a fascinating and revealing interview with Lang from 1975, an historic look at M and its road to  restoration, a gallery of rare photos and production sketches, and a handsome, celebratory booklet. A special bonus is the British version which incorporates dubbing and re-shot scenes with different actors. Lorre, however, replays his entire ending monologue in English.<br /><br />One of my all-time personal favorites, M is an essential addition to every classic film enthusiast's collection, and this sparkling Blu-ray is as good as it can get.
 | product/productId: 0767825616 | review/userId: A1EC7RHO2M8TGR | review/summary: Poitier, a milkman? I think not. | review/text: To those viewers/reviewers who comment that the message of &quot;Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner&quot; would have been more effective had the Poitier character been a working class guy because that would have shaken up the Hepburn&amp;Tracy middle-class sensibilities, I have this to say: this movie was about racism, and specifically about racism where it's least expected - in the hearts of those who espouse anti-racist philosophies and teach their kids to be open-minded and tolerant. If Poitier had been a working class character, the test situtation that this comedy/drama creates would have been diluted, because then we'd be examining the family's class prejudices and not their racism. A movie can't do everything. What this movie does so brilliantly is remove all the objections a family like the one in the movie could have to a potential son-in-law and those have to do primarily with social class, intellectual sophistication and profession. The Poitier character is an ideal son-in-law, except... And it's that EXCEPT that the movie looks at.

Even when he caught up with the kids that left the camp he could have turned around and went back to their oasis. At least that's what I would have done. I don't really tink they needed him, but it's a movie and i guess it would have been boring if Max didn't do his thing.

The animation is bar none the best the Disney team has ever produced. The gentleness of the animals in the landscapes of the forest, so tenderly drawn as if they were delicate  ceramic pieces. The story alone one can see the sheer beauty and patience  Disney has put into this film, where the characters seem fragile, but yet  have a life of thier own, growing up in the woods where anything can  happen. Aside from some speculated &quot;violent&quot; scenes near the end,  I would highly reccomend this to anyone, family and friend alike.

Wanted to watch this movie for a long time being one of the iconic and most stylish of romantic comedies ever. Hepburn is at her best, with a young George Peppard (whom unfortunately didn't see more of him in such roles). Mancini's music is haunting and Edwards direction impeccable - elegance is the first term which comes to mind watching this film - besides the elegant cut in the dresses designed by Givenchy for Hepburn. One should not fail to credit the novel by Capote (of which some changes were done in characters etc.) A work of the golden years of Hollywood films which is now lost to the explicit, ugly, gruesome, un-elegant and pathetic films produced.
 | product/productId: 0792840046 | review/userId: AJMU8VVFKMZI4 | review/summary: Not my favorite Bette Davis film | review/text: 3.5 stars.  I'm a big Bette Davis fan, but the script left me wanting.  The whole time I was watching this, I kept making comparisons to Gone with the Wind- just a old campier version.  I'm not crazy about films that lay the troubles of the world at the feet of women-especially when the biggest crime she committed was to wear a red dress to a ball-which in a B&W film the whole red dress thing loses it's impact.  Just when the film was getting real interesting, the credits roll and I'm looking around to see whether there was a second disc missing.  That's it? You're kidding me.  Again, I LOOOOVE Bette Davis and this was a decent performance by both her a Henry Fonda (the Ashley character) but I just didn't care for this script like I'd hoped I would.

No example is better than that of Batman.<p>Watching his parents murdered as a young child, young Bruce Wayne  dedicates his life to fighting the forces that tore apart his world.  Obsessed to the point of mania, he hides behind a mask, appears only at  night, and lives outside the law. His desire for revenge consumes  him.<p>His nemesis - the gangster who gunned down his family - becomes  horribly disfigured while trying to escape him, and is tipped into  homicidal mania by his scars. He becomes a crazed terrorist using chemical  weapons against civilians.<p>The two characters oppose each other in every  sense; the irony is heightened by each one being responsible for creating  the other.  This is not a story for children to appreciate.<p>Burton  successfully creates a brooding, gothic look to his city and characters. He  draws inspiration from Lang's Metropolis, especially in the final scene  atop the cathedral.<p>Look beyond the script flaws to enjoy a fantastic  performance from Jack Nicholson and a dark visual delight.

Deliciously dark and directed with enthusiasm by Wise before he'd made it big, Born to Kill is a genuine oddity which explores the dark side of sexuality without moralizing, with the bonus of a cracking murder plot to add some spice. Tierney pitches his performance just right ... The film sits well with all those minor noir classics the late 40's and early 50's with apparent ease: Wise's own "The Set-Up"; Anthony Mann's "Raw Deal" and the "T-Men", "Kiss Of Death", and Ray's masterly debut, "They Live By Night".<br /><br />Under Robert Wise  (Director), Herman Schlom  (Producer), Eve Greene  (Screenwriter), James Gunn  (Book Author), Richard Macaulay  (Screenwriter), Robert de Grasse  (Cinematographer), Constantin Bakaleinikoff  (Musical Direction/Supervision), Paul Sawtell  (Composer (Music Score), Les Millbrook  (Editor), Albert S.

 | product/productId: 1577422651 | review/userId: A3AL8X8SAYBP3X | review/summary: The serendipitous viewing that changed my life... | review/text: Late one night, while in a hotel room in London, England, I happened to come across this documentary on the BBC and have not been the same since. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film was the winner of the Best Documentary  Feature (1997)by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  (&quot;Oscar&quot;). The musical score by Lee Holdridge is nothing short of  extraordinary as is Freeman's narration. Also featured are other great  voices that impart testimonials of those that had survived the Holocaust,  and who were attempting to make their way out of Germany following their  miraculous survival. The documentary focuses on the plight of Holocaust  survivors from their Liberation, to 1948, the year of Israel's birth--a  rather unstudied period--at least in the visual, documentary realm. A  stunning and indispensable film.

It does what every film or book should do, it stimulates your imagination.  I grew up in the age of special effects and Star Wars and ILM wizardry.  Were this movie to be made today there would be some mystical rabbit in some form floating around that we all could see(Think of maybe Roger Rabbit or Jar-Jar Binks).  Because there is no rabbit, it only isolates those people who can see the mysterious Pooka of which Elwood speaks.  Jimmy Stewart's performance is one of the best in his career.  Don't waste time on effects, focus on the character that develops in Jimmy Stewart, and the way his character changes those around him.

 | product/productId: 0780619714 | review/userId: A1E0EMJZWPUANQ | review/summary: FLAWLESS VICTORY! | review/text: Mortal Kombat is a movie adapted from a video game but it is different than the rest.  It is the only one ever made that does not SUCK.  The film begins with Chan fighting and losing his soul to Shang Tsung.  Chan is the brother of Liu Kang, whose sole purpose in the film is to travel to Outworld to find Shang Tsung and exact revenge for his brother's death.  The other characters include Sonya Blade,(Pete Sampras' wife), whose partner is murdered by Kano.  Johnny Cage(Linden Ashby) is a famous movie star and is insulted when the press begin to doubt his ability and do not take him seriously as a martial artist.  All three warriors travel to outworld to prevent the earth from a take over.  It is obvious that nobody in this movie except Robin Shou(Liu Kang) knows how to fight in real life.  Although Linden Ashby cannot fight he sells it very well and actually resembles the real Johnny Cage from the video game.  The two best fighting scenes are Liu Kang vs. Sub-Zero and Liu Kang vs. Reptile.  This movie is not the greatest, but after seeing the sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat:Annihilation&quot; I must say that I appreciate the little bit of originality that this movie has to offer!
 | product/productId: 6302388147 | review/userId: A1BFPE8GKJBSBM | review/summary: Great film! | review/text: This movie gets a lot of mixed reviews, but anything negative is unfounded. The film is wonderful! It is more talkitive than regular Hitchcock films, but it is essential to understand the plot, which is so complex that it is absolutly Hitchcockian. Joseph Cotten keeps you guessing until nearly the end of the film about whether or not he's good or bad and Bergan's journey from fallen lady back to grace is, as usual, very well acted.<br /><br />While this isn't the film for the Hitchcock fan only, it is great. It's not a film the action seeker only will enjoy. You have to be willing to listen to the conversation and handle the slower pace at the start. It quickly picks up in the middle and doesn't dissapoint.

One movie..three different roles. Dr. Strangelove has stood the test of time since its release. If memory serves me correct this movie was originally to be released in late 1963 but was delayed due to the assassination of President Kennedy. George C.Scott did a superb job in his role. The scene in which the President (Peter Sellers) calling his Russian counterpart was hilarious. Worth watching again!!

 | product/productId: 6302158176 | review/userId: ANBOOQR5NVJPM | review/summary: The Sins of the Fathers... | review/text: I consider this movie a fitting endpiece to the saga of the Corleone Family.  I think it is the best and most deeply moving piece of the Trilogy.<br /><br />It is about the end game of the quintessential idealist, Michael Corleone.<br /><br />Whereas his father (Marlin Brando) was the honor bound pragmatist, his brother Sonny was the violent loose cannon, his brother Freco was the gutless whiner, Michael was moved by his ideals and what he considered was right.<br /><br />In Godfather 1, we see him throwing away his ideals for Family protection, and in Godfather 2, we see him turned to stone by his own actions.  This is stressed in the Birthday party scene at the end of Godfather 2.<br /><br />In Godfather 3, we see a sick and dying Godfather haunted by the once idealistic Michael Corleone he was.  The idealism is returning to him, and of neccesity there had to be recompence for the earlier sins he did.  Yet the Sins of the Father affected all of his attempted repentance.  He paid the ultimate price at the end by the death of his daughter being part of the neccesary attonement.  And after all that, in the end, he has visions of dancing with the most important women in his life, all which he threw away by his behavior.  He died totally alone and unloved.<br /><br />My favorite caracter was Joe Montagna (Joey Zasa)  When Vince blew him away, I cheered!  Could that caracter be based on John Gotti?  Hmmmmm...

Of course, before there was Indecent Proposal, there was Honeymoon in Vegas. The story is funny and ingenuous, and obviously, it's all in a ridiculous fun. The best part of the film is always the sight of the Flying Elvises. Another funny part is when the Mike Tyson guy was describing how he was doing his wife which got Jack Singer all insane. Hilariously stupid and funny. It's Nicolas Cage who makes the film to work because of his constant yelling out of frustration. All in all, Honeymoon in Vegas is the one to watch.
 | product/productId: 0783241313 | review/userId: A1BG88N69Q7W1S | review/summary: A 'Can't miss'...that does. | review/text: As a lifelong fan of Andy Kaufman, as well as the bizarre circus known as pro wrestling, I remember being very happy to hear about the then-upcoming biopic, 'Man on the moon'. When I heard it was directed by Milos Forman, creator of 3 of my favorite films ('One flew over the cuckoo's nest', 'Amadeus', and 'The people vs Larry Flynt'), I started chomping at the bit. I saw an early clip of Jim Carrey's astounding imitation of Kaufman, and at that point was prepared to give it early entry into my 'Top 40 films ever' list, without even seeing it! This, to me, appeared to be the definiton of a 'can't miss' movie.<br />  Sadly, I was way off. Just as Forman and, in the end, Carrey himself were in the making of this huge disappointment. In the 3 Forman films I listed above, as well as 'Ragtime', another critically lauded picture of his, the last description i ever expected to attach to the Acadamy Award winning director's output would be "by the numbers". But that's exactly what this formulaic, phony feeling effort is.<br />  Besides numerous gaffes, which is unforgivable in as bland and distant as this film feels, the movie does the one thing Kaufman himself NEVER did-become predictable. In the end, the only memorable thing about the entire project is Carrey's impression of Kaufman, which is a sad statement indeed. Andy deserved better.

 | product/productId: 0790734060 | review/userId: A2BPDFR58H9575 | review/summary: Amadeus - Beloved of Gods | review/text: Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that "Amadeus" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these "monsters with green eyes" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...<br /><br />Once again, "Amadeus" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.<br /><br />Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young

 | product/productId: 630204460X | review/userId: A25ZVI6RH1KA5L | review/summary: 'Based  on a true story...' | review/text: ... with only the names changed to protect the innocent'...does this sound familiar?  Some have likened He Walked by Night (1948) to the 50's television series Dragnet, and there are some similarities (one of the biggest being both feature Jack Webb), but this film differs from that popular series in that the focus is one the story, with emphasis placed both on the detective work and the elusive criminal, generally featuring the criminal more prominently, while Dragnet tended to deal more with the character of Joe Friday, with his no nonsense demeanor, and his partner, cracking whatever case may lay before them for that week, in my opinion.  I've read that a police department advisor to this film actually suggested to Webb (who had a detective radio show at the time) that he do a radio series based on actual police files, and from this came the idea for Dragnet, which eventually evolved into the television series.<br /><br />Directed by Alfred L. Werker (apparently Anthony Mann, a name known to noir fans, directed a good part of this film, uncredited), the film stars Richard Basehart, who played Ishmael to Gregory Peck's Captain Ahab in the 1956 version of Moby Dick, but is probably most well known for his vast television credentials spanning the late 50's up until the early 80's prior to his death in 1984 of a stroke (a few of the, in fact).  Also appearing is Scott Brady (The Law vs. Billy the Kid), Roy Roberts (Chinatown), Whit Bissell (Target Earth), James Cardwell (The Return of the Whistler), and, as I mentioned before, Jack Webb (Dragnet).<br /><br />The film starts off with the slaying of a police officer as he stopped on his way home late one night to investigate a suspicious looking character (Basehart) trying to gain entry into an electronics store.  After a confrontation, the police begin an extensive manhunt for the would be thief, now killer (the police get really rattled when one of their own gets killed, I figure as if you're nutty or desperate enough to kill a cop, you'd probably do just about anything).  Anyway, the descriptions of the killer are vague at best, and the police (after drudging up every ne'er-do-well they can lay hands on) find the killer is no ordinary criminal, but a very intelligent, wily fellow who is a master at covering his tracks, among other things.  The initial investigation turns up bupkiss, forcing the authorities to work over again and again whatever small clues they have, and to also develop different methods for locating this calculating character.  After exhaustively following up new leads uncovered by some rather ingenious investigation, the killer's trail begins to grow warm again, and soon they're hot on his heels, but he won't be taken easily, as he's still has a few tricks up his sleeve.  It's a deadly game of cat and mouse (although sometimes, I wondered who was the cat, and who was the mouse?).<br /><br />One aspect I found interesting about this movie was that it tended to shy away from focusing too much on the characters, but more on the story itself.  After the initial crime, a lot of time is spent on detailing the efforts of the long, and sometimes tedious, investigation by the police, with plenty of ominous voice over providing expository information for the viewer.  We see that police work is comprised of not of lucky guesswork, but thorough, investigative, sometimes inventive (look for the scene where the witnesses are called upon to provide a composite of the individual believed to have committed a number of crimes) techniques used in the identification and locating processes.  We also get a look into the inner workings of a meticulous, intelligent criminal, his means and methods for always managing to stay one step ahead of the authorities (I especially enjoyed the scene where he had to operate on himself, removing a slug from his side after a close call with the police...one thing about the criminal world, adequate healthcare can be difficult to obtain, especially when dealing with gunshot wounds, as nosey hospitals are prone to ask way too many questions).  I will say this...that Richard Basehart was certainly more spry at the age of 34 (that's how old he was when he appeared here) than I am, running his behind off and flinging himself down sewer drains (he used the large and expansive Los Angeles sewer system as a means to travel).  I thought all the actors did a fine job, making their appearances blend in nicely as not to overshadow the main element, that being the actual story, as I think was the intent.  Basehart provides a wonderful performance as the emotionless, shadowy, hard to finger criminal baffling the police at nearly ever turn.  Jack Webb does appear briefly, as a forensic scientist, offering information he obtained from weapons and equipment confiscated from the criminal car, as he had to leave it behind during an escape.  The film is listed in the `noir' genre, and there are some techniques indicative of that genre utilized throughout, but it seems more than what it is, as the movie plays more like a brooding documentary, relating actual events, rather than developing a fictitious story with hard-boiled characters, although I will say the ending is certainly in line with what one would expect within the genre-a stark, cold, unrepentant, finale, highlighting superior cinematic techniques, excellent lighting, and recognizable L.A. locations used throughout the film.<br /><br />The full screen (original aspect ratio) picture provided by MGM on this DVD looks amazing, and the audio is very sharp (the echoing footsteps in sewer scenes sound wonderful and create a real level of suspense suitable for the climatic ending).  There are chapter stops and English subtitles, but no special features available, which didn't bother me, given the excellent quality of the transfer and of the film itself.  Worth looking into if you like solid, entertaining crime dramas.<br /><br />Cookieman108
 | product/productId: 5552439651 | review/userId: A19JYLHD94K94D | review/summary: Smile, darn ya, smile! | review/text: First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.<br /><br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.
 | product/productId: 0790736942 | review/userId: A30SEFSHDK5RX | review/summary: The Scariest Movie Of All Time! | review/text: PLOT:  The film begins at an archaeological dig in Iraq. One of the men working there is a 70-something year old priest named Father Lancaster Merrin (Max von Sydow.) Merrin has had a long and dark history. Something scares him more than anything. Merrin is getting ready to go back to America, but before leaving, he finds a statue at the excavation; a statue of a demon named Pazuzu. Merrin stares straight into the eyes of the statue and he feels a pain in the pit of his stomache, for he knows that one day he will have to face the devil again. The film then jumps to the other side of the world, in Georgetown (Washington D.C.) A famous actress named Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) lives there with her pre-teen daughter Regan (Linda Blair). Regan is a very loveable child, but suddenly she starts to show strange behavior. She starts swearing, urinating in front of people, acting violent. Doctors say that she has a rare nervous disorder, but ridolin doesn't help and her condition starts to get worse; much worse. When Chris has no one else to turn to, she goes to see Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). She asks him if he would perform an exorcism on Regan, but he quickly turns her down because he needs approval from the Catholic Church; not to mention he has his own inner demons to deal with. He finally agrees to review Regan's condition. With the evidence he can collect, he may be able to get approval from the Church. Karras, a psychiatrist as well as a priest, feels that there is probably a mental explanation for Regan's condition. He soon realizes that he is up against the devil himself.<br /><br />COMMENTS:  In my honest opinion, this is the scariest film of all time. I had the pleasure of seeing this film in the theater when it was re-released in 2000, and it scared the hell out of me. William Friedkin's directorial style was brilliant. The film also boasts a fine cast with great acting. William Peter Blatty wrote the screenplay based on his own 1971 novel, and it's fantastic. Not only is this a great horror film, it's a great character study. We see that both Merrin and Karras are men of God, but they are flawed characters. Merrin has had a run-in with the devil before and he's scared to death of him. He knows that he has an on-going fight with him. Karras has his own insecurities as well; he begins to doubt his faith and constantly blaims himself for the death of his mother. Blatty's novel was actually inspired by a true story. A 13-year-old boy from Mt. Rainier, Maryland named Robbie was possessed by a demon in 1949. Robbie was able to make his bed shake without touching it, as well as move several other objects without physical contact. The boy also said blasphemous things in a diabolical voice. The local cardinal authorized an exorcism. The exorcism process lasted for 2 months. The demon within finally recognized the presence of St. Michael and was expelled from Robbie's body forever. Robbie remembered nothing of the possession afterwards, except the vision of St. Michael. The film was eventually followed by 2 inferior sequels: "Exorcist II: The Heretic" (1977) and "The Exorcist III" (1990); the latter was based on William Peter Blatty's sequel novel "Legion" (1983). 2 prequels also followed: "Exorcist: The Beginning" (2004) and it's alternate version "Dominion: Prequel To The Exorcist" (2005); the latter was released straight to DVD. This new DVD presents the film in its original widescreen theatrical ratio. This updated version has extra scenes not seen in the original 1973 release. It also features commentary by William Friedkin, bios and facts, and the theatrical trailer. I would recommend this film to anybody. It is a timeless classic.
 | product/productId: 5553637791 | review/userId: A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK | review/summary: Drek from the Fifties | review/text: After watching this movie to the point where we see the Robot Monster stride about a desert-like landscape, I backed up to the beginning to see if Ed Wood had somehow had a hand in this film; he does not.  After seeing this movie, I wonder why anyone would still want their name associated with it.<br /><br />We see young Johnny (Gregory Moffett) scampering about the landscape, playing with his toy ray gun.  He wanders into a cave where two scientists are supposedly searching for human artifacts.  Shortly, mommy (Selena Royle, who appeared in "The Fighting Sullivans," "30 Seconds Over Tokyo," "The Harvey Girls," and the tv soap "As the World Turns"), hot sister Alice (Claudia Barrett) and little sister Carla (Pamela Paulson) come to tell Johnny that it is time for his nap.<br /><br />Johnny soon wakes from his nap and goes back to the cave, where he discovers the scientists are gone and something strange is happening.  Shortly, accompanied by special effects, a fearsome Ro-Man appears.  We soon learn that the Ro-Men are either afraid of us becoming strong enough to attack them or they want our planet as a fun place to destroy; the movie seems to struggle as to their motivation.  Somewhere along the line the Ro-Man destroyed the entire population of the earth except for eight people, all of whom had a vaccine that turns out to protect them from the Ro-Man's death ray (a convenient side effect!).  There are also men on the space platform, which looks a lot like a model rocket on strings, until the Ro-Men decide it needs destruction too.<br /><br />One thing I struggled to understand was how Ro-Man was able to destroy the two or so billion people on earth at that time, and yet was unable to find the few remaining people.  Ah, it turns out that the vaccine also makes the people invisible to Ro-Man's detecting devices (I think).  How convenient.<br /><br />This movie is funnier than it is scary.  The Ro-Men, both played by George Barrows and voiced by John Brown, are gorilla suits topped off with a fishbowl helmet.  The fishbowl helmet seems to be adorned by old television rabbit ears.  Of course robots are logical creatures, so we find Ro-Man and his boss Great Guidance gesturing wildly to emphasize their point.  The director probably considered such gestures important since Ro-men have no apparent mouths.  Our earthly Ro-Man soon behaves more strangely as he succumbs to the charms of hot sister Alice to the point where he takes a stab at removing her clothing.<br /><br />Because there is insufficient plot to fill an hour (my DVD player claims the movie ended about 62 minutes or so after it began, but imdb states the movie is 66 minutes long), we see a lot of scenes of Ro-Man walking about the landscape, which is about as thrilling as watching clouds move.  My mind started wandering and I wondered how George Barrows could handle stumbling about the hills of California in that hot suit.  The actions scenes are similarly well staged.  Because Ro-Man seems unable to manage more than a fast walk, his victims pretty much have to fall or walk into his grasp.<br /><br />An interesting side note.  Elmer Bernstein, who composed the music for more than 250 movies and television shows, did the excellent music for this film.  After seeing Bernstein's name in the opening credits I found myself fascinated by the music more frequently than the plot.  I initially wondered how Bernstein became involved in this movie until reviewing his career.  This movie was one of his first and well in advance of credits that would firmly establish his capabilities.<br /><br />This movie has an interesting ending.  I am reluctant to say surprise because I noticed something early in the movie that, if you are watching with even minimal care, will give you a significant clue as to the end.  The only thing about the end that surprised me was the cheesy double exposure of the Ro-Man walking out of the cave several times.  I am clueless as to the purpose of that part of the ending.  The Ro-Man ending may have been intended to be scary, but the repetition became tedious and then funny.<br /><br />Movies such as this are rarely made these days.  When they are made they usually go direct to cable or direct to video.  As cheesy as this movie is, it is still a fun movie to watch in a group because it provides great material for extemporaneous jokes.  You will want this movie if you are collecting the films of any of the actors, cheesy science fiction movies that likely were drive-in theater fodder, or cheesy science fiction films of the 50s.  This movie is not quite as bad as Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space," but it is very close, and consequently is nearly a cult classic.

It was with great dissapointment and some anger that I discovered that the producers of the DVD have shortened the movie, eliminating most of the scenes of violence and basically rendering it a collection of nice shots of the Utah mountains.  This has been done without explaination, apology or even warning; the movie is now less than two hours long (but with intermission intact) and contains many clumsy cuts in the last third, during the indian fighting scenes.  The remaining film still contains a shadow of the original epic but I wish it had remained intact.

It's simply not possible to accomodate the same level of character development, plot and subplot development, and rich descriptions possible in a book on a  2 hour film.  &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is no exception to that  trend.<p>This movie is, nevertheless, a good show with good acting (and  some not so good) that tells much of the basic story of Dumas' book of the  same name.<p>I think that Richard Chamberlain does a good job as Edmond  Dantes, Tony Curtis as Fernand Mondego, Donald Pleasance as the Baron  Danglar, and Louis Jourdan as DeVillefore.  I was not at all impressed by  the character that played Cadarousse.  <p>The scenes with Edmond Dantes and  his fiance, Mercedes, are done well and set the emotional stage for the  rest of the movie.<p>Most of the the main elements of the book are touched  on in the movie, but not much about the relationship between Monte Cristo  and the daughter of the Ali Pasha.<p>The way that Monte Cristo earns his  revenge is rivetting, especially the plan to destroy DeVillefore.  A  masterpiece of deception and intruige.<p>While the movie lacks a lot that  the book offers, I still enjoy the movie immensely, and believe that you  will too.  <p>4 stars.

 | product/productId: 630197154X | review/userId: A2V3P1XE33NYC3 | review/summary: Wake up and smell the cathode | review/text: Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 blockbuster hit "Network" is, I truly believe, the best film satire ever made. It might well be the best film regardless of genre ever made in the United States, better than "Citizen Kane," better than "The Godfather," better than any of the other numerous contenders. The first time I saw "Network" was on television about ten years ago, a supreme irony that became more and more amusing as the film progressed, and the powerhouse dialogue, performances, and set pieces captured my imagination unlike any other film. I have since watched this film so many times that at one point I could quote large chunks of dialogue verbatim with the greatest of ease. Over the past several years, however, I haven't seen Chayefsky's masterpiece as often as I would like. When I decided I would finally tackle the daunting prospect of writing a review for this movie, I rented the DVD version and resubmerged myself into the dark world of Howard Beale, Max Schumacher, Diana Christensen, and Frank Hackett. And I rediscovered something I always realize every time I watch this magnificent piece of cinema: "Network" is as great a movie as it was the first time I saw it, and it's prescience to our modern world continues to astonish.<br /><br />"Network" takes the viewer inside of a major television network, UBS, during the 1970s. Their prime time newscaster, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), has just received word from his boss Max Schumacher (William Holden) that the network is terminating his contract due to low ratings. Perturbed about leaving his position, and with nothing else in life to live for, Beale breaks down on television and promises his audience that he will kill himself on live television the following evening. Not surprisingly, this revelation causes quite a stir amongst the suits on the upper floors. Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), the new overseer of the network since its acquisition by a larger corporation called CCA, threatens once again to clean house. Schumacher convinces Hackett and the other executives to hold off because Howard is essentially insane, and he even manages to get Beale back on the air the following evening in order to issue a public apology. Max has his own reasons for supporting Beale: the network is threatening to cut the budget of the news division in order to decrease the debt load, a decision they failed to notify Schumacher about beforehand. When Howard goes off on a rant about the sicknesses of American society the following evening, Max refuses to cut the live feed as a protest against the network's unfair treatment.<br /><br />Hackett hits the roof, but when entertainment division chief Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) convinces him that Beale's rants brought in a record number of viewers, a new idea quickly forms. What if the network encouraged Howard's irrational behavior? What if they made a program based solely on his prophecies about the state of modern America? That's exactly what Christensen and Hackett accomplish when "The Howard Beale Show" debuts on UBS. In front of a roaring crowd, the former newsman raves about the evils of corporatism, the corrosive effects of television, and public corruption. At the end of each tirade, Beale collapses in a faint in front of the cameras. Audiences eat these histrionics up, and ratings for the show go through the roof. UBS is well on its way to turning a profit. Meanwhile, a subplot about Max and Diana plays out. The two embark on a tempestuous love affair despite their professional quibbling about Howard and Max's longtime marriage. While Christensen sets about creating new programs highlighting left-wing revolutionary activities, programs like "The Mao Tse-Tung Hour," Max leaves his wife and moves into Diana's apartment. Their relationship resembles a television program, and as Howard's ratings slip after he receives a readjustment to his worldview from CCA chairman Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), Max and Diana's union also falters. The film's conclusion is as cruel as it is darkly hilarious.<br /><br />I've never seen, nor do I expect to ever see again, a film like "Network." Each element of the film fires on every cylinder. Time stops while watching this picture. The performances from major and minor characters are sublime, but it's Peter Finch who grabs the spotlight with both hands and refuses to let go. His Howard Beale raves, rants, gesticulates, and issues statements on the world that spellbind with their power and elegance. His monologue to Max about his mental state, his lecture to audiences about the illusion of television, and his take on corporate buyouts brings me to my feet every time I hear them. Just as memorable is Arthur Jensen's mind-blowing analysis of the true nature of the corporate universe and the ultimate fate of mankind if the citizens of the world allow his ilk to have their way. The film ends with Max Schumacher labeling Diana Christensen "television incarnate" because of her total inability to form meaningful emotional connections. In fact, the mindlessness and callousness of television, how it reduces every aspect of human sentiment and interaction to one-dimensional superficialities, ultimately destroys every character in this film.<br /><br />I could keep going ad infinitum, explaining how Max represents the common man faced with the daunting task of giving in to his cravings for television (re: Diana) or simply turning it off for good by returning to the wholesomeness of family life. I could also examine how Chayefsky shows us television destroying not only those who watch it but also those who fill the medium with images, i.e. the decision Hackett and Christensen feel they must make concerning Beale's plummeting ratings. What I really want to do is fill this review with line after line of the brilliant dialogue uttered in this film. I won't though; you need to see this tour de force motion picture for yourself. And realize how much of it pertains to our society today. Mad as hell, indeed!
 | product/productId: 0780619412 | review/userId: A3RY85QM7F3XF6 | review/summary: Horror's Master | review/text: I usually begin reviews with a plot synopsis, but for A Nightmare on Elm Street, there is really no use. Everyone knows the story of Freddy Krueger. Just like Heather Langenkamp mentioned in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, "Every kid knows who Freddy is. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong ...".<br /><br /> There really isn't much one could say about A Nightmare on Elm Street that hasn't been said before. It's a true horror classic. Wes Craven created a world wherein the only place one thinks is the safest is the place where there is no safety. Robert Englund gave gruesome life to the character of Freddy Krueger, and it is here that he is his scariest and most brutal (aside from New Nightmare). Heather Langenkamp embodied a true frightened teenager who realizes that only she can destroy Freddy after he has stripped every single bit of life she once had. The transition from normal teenager to - like I said - a girl who's life has been stripped from her by a man who everyone thinks to be dead is seamless. The atmosphere that Craven gave to the film is chilling with every mood portrayed amazingly through each scene.<br /><br /> The DVD we get is not top-notch, but it is worthy of owning. The commentary was taken from the laserdisc commentary, but it's still worth listening to. To hear Craven, Langenkamp, John Saxon, and Haitkin talk about their experiences with the movie, the origins of it, and more is a great listen for fans. The theatrical trailer is also here. I am really hoping for a newer edition in the future (you know how crazy dvd is) because there is tons of material that is not available on the DVD that I know is out there. Many deleted scenes, a few more trailers / teasers, and a new documentary on the entire series would be amazing.<br /><br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street is a true horror classic given a good treatment on this DVD release

Topics include open-water canning, pressure canning, dehydration, lacto-fermentation and even root cellaring. I have several books on each of these topics, but the coverage in the video is extremely thorough and professionally done. Many of the somewhat confusing, or worrisome tasks, like using a pressure canner without blowing up the house :) are clearly explained. I was especially pleased with the section on lacto-fermentation, as I hadn't anticipated it, but have begun to realize what a healthful preservation technique it is. As my title indicates, I've bought a copy for each of my three sisters and my father because, like me, we are a generation who has lost this fundamental skill for self-sustainability. This is a film to get to share with fellow gardeners and local food groups as well.

All of you who haven't made up your mind, do yourself and  the world a favor; stop being a cheap slob and buy this film already. Don a  fedora, shake up a few martinis and grab the dame that you love. This movie  has everything besides exploding cars and foul language. Sure it's got men  getting shot up, but they have it coming... you see! And sure, there are more  then a few people telling some really huge whoppers to get the ones they  love out of hot water, but who hasn't? And Bogart's got some real slap, not  unlike the back of my hand! This brings back the days when movies had plot,  for you folks out there who aren't in the know... a plot is storytelling  besides something that happens that leads up to a couple explosions at the  end. This is the kind of movie where men are men, women are women, the  crooks are scared, and the only thing thicker then the cigarette smoke is  the tension and chemistry between Bogart and Bacall.  Stop wasting  time: order this movie... Now!
 | product/productId: 6300214222 | review/userId: A1OOYXSUI4Z943 | review/summary: Up Where We Belong | review/text: "An Officer and a Gentleman" is a wonderful story about a man named Zack Mayo who zoins the navy, although his alcoholic father disagrees with his decision. Zack (played marvelously by Richard Gere) really doesn't care about anyone else but himself at first. He even gets into some unethical scheme at the navy. Sergeant Foley (flawlessly potrayed by Louis Gosset Jr.) can see right through Zack "Mayo-Naisse" and he endeavors to break Zack until he finally quits. Zack can't quit, he won't. Because of Foley's mind manipulations, Zack learns a little bit about being a better person. He also meets a good friend at the navy. And, he meets a girl walking past the naval camp whom he thinks is hot. The girl, Paula (played excellently by Debra Winger) sees Zack again at a party, and the two hook up. First, they like each other in a cute way, and a sex-related way, but the passion they feel for each other escalates into a meaningful relationship. The ending is uplifting and romantically brilliant! An ultimate fantasy of happiness and love. The musical score perfectly fits the mood, and the original song played during the ending credits, "Up Where We Belong", by Joe Cocker, is lovely. I highly recommend "An Officer and a Gentleman", a film that teaches about friendships, loss, perseverance, and love. "Way to go, Paula, way to go!!"

 | product/productId: 0783114621 | review/userId: A1F4DZWMC5YH9A | review/summary: great writing and supporting cast | review/text: Aside from the already praised performances of the leads, I should add that the characterizations are all very good, with all the nuances of these men's relationships with each other well performed. The guy who played  Peter Lawford deserves a mark, I think, for his portrayal of the simpering,  not very talented friend who nonetheless had Kennedy connections. The mob  sub-plot is kind of silly, given what we've seen before, but probably  necessary for drama. The Kennedy stuff is fun, especially their scheming  old man, although Marilyn Monroe is played like a zombie. <p>One complaint:  Frank is basically &quot;between women&quot; here, and the lack of a strong  female character shows. But all-in-all, well-written by Kario Salem, who  played a hippyesque half-breed Marcel Pasquinel in the 70s mini-series  &quot;Centennial.&quot; And the music swings, baby...
 | product/productId: 0800193873 | review/userId: A391RY3TA1MCVM | review/summary: Still fantastic after all these years | review/text: The Fifth Element was released in 1997 and is still far better than most movies released today, in large part because it is steeped in imagination and humour and gives new life to the old "The world is threatened, we need a hero to save us" storyline, even though this one features an embittered ex-soldier down on his luck. Rather than explain the film from start to finish I'd urge you to sit back and immerse yourself into some serious craziness. In parts the movie does descend into near incoherence yet saves itself each time with good humour and great acting, not to mention amazing backdrops and scenery design. The plot moves at a very rapid pace and several times while watching it again I had to hit the pause button and explain the latest twist to bemused relatives. The Ultimate Edition is particularly useful, since it offers a second DVD with a number of extra features on how the film was created and how the complex costumes were put together.

 | product/productId: 078881107X | review/userId: A30JPZ9TZ7I61U | review/summary: Possibly the cutest cat voice ever (the Japanese version)! | review/text: Just putting in my two cents here:<br /><br />I have viewed this in the two English dub versions as well as the original Japanese.  I must say that the original Japanese is the best of the three by far.  I enjoy foreign films and anime, so I am used to hearing films in their original dialogue.  The actor who voices Jiji is absolutely amazing (in the Japanese version), the perfect mix of wit, sarcasm, narcissism, and cuteness.<br /><br />The film is one of Miyazaki's more lighthearted pieces.  You won't find boar demons or sky pirates or evil wizards casting curses here.  Though on the surface it does appear simple and heartwarming, there is a bit more to it than that.  Kiki grapples with coming to age and understanding her witchy powers.  As with most Miyazaki films, the heroine is rather ordinary looking but possesses strength and courage and a kind heart.  She is well liked by those she meets and often performs good deeds.  This creates an instantly likable protagonist, with whom the viewer sympathizes.  Add to this an interesting cast (although the Waldo look alike kid gets kind of annoying at times!), and you have the recipe for a wonderful feel-good film.<br /><br />Though Disney casts these films well for the English track, I still think it best to at least watch the original Japanese version of these films at least once.  Though Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle (with the exception of Christian Bale) have better English tracks than the English dubs on other Miyazaki films.<br /><br />This is certainly as good and lighthearted a film as My Neighbor Totoro and deserves a viewing by any Miyazaki fan.  I am an adult (no kids) and I still love his films.<br /><br />Also recommended: My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away<br />Recommended but a little more grown up themes: Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, Nausicaa
 | product/productId: 6302420458 | review/userId: A27QLYGAM9AU3M | review/summary: Wow!!!  What a film! | review/text: I'm not sure if people remember just how groundbreaking the editing on this film really was back in '91, but this is an enthralling 3.5 hour overview of the major questions that D.A. Jim Garrison raised about the Kennedy Assassination in his book &quot;On The Trail of the Assassins.&quot;  This film is a tour-de-force by Oliver Stone, and was very controversial for mixing new footage with real archived film clips in a way that many felt would only mislead the uninformed.  They have a point - some details of the arguments here don't hold up to careful scrutiny (truly interested persons should check out other sources, such as Gerald Posner's &quot;Case Closed&quot;) but the amazing thing about this film is that in just a few hours, it gives an amazingly rich &quot;crash course&quot; in the controversies surrounding the assassination investigation.  It successfully conveys Garrison's point of view as a well-intentioned professional who descends from a normal sense of early-60s civic pride into a multi-year journey of doubt about U.S. democracy, and anxiety regarding social changes.  The Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, political unrest and assassinations of the 60s...  This is a truly impressive film at relating one man's loss of civic faith, even if you disagree completely with the premises it explores.  It is loaded with stars and cameo appearances.  It can be enjoyed (or studied) again and again.  Particularly notable on the DVD is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the real version of the film's &quot;Mr. X&quot; that encouraged and guided Garrison's suspicions.  Gary Oldman gives a completely knockout performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, and in my opinion this film also contains the best performance I've seen from Kevin Costner!  Surely only its controversy kept this from Best Picture Oscar possibilities.  What an amazing piece of filmmaking!  And the entire film is contained on one disc, too!

 | product/productId: 079284615X | review/userId: A3U56M0Y8LYO6J | review/summary: "Once more unto the breach, dear friends." | review/text: Surely there have been times in literature class when you have rolled your eyes at the latest Shakespeare reading assignment.  It is true that Shakespeare on the page can be puzzling enough to make you wonder what all the fuss is about.  However, when his works are translated to the stage or the screen, you can begin to appreciate the scope and drama of his works.  Case in point is Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of "Henry V."<p>Branagh's cinematic version of Henry's exploits is a grungy and savage one.  Mixed among the stirring speeches are mounds of dead bodies and faces streaked with dried blood.  The battles in this film are uncompromising and raw.  Yet amid this chaos, one never loses track of the political intrigue unfolding behind the scenes.  That is the triumph of this film - its riveting action sequences organically spring forth from the diplomatic maneuvering that prompted the conflict between England and France.  They never feel like bloated Hollywood-esque action sequences tacked on to relieve your boredom.  These are battles that have a purpose behind them.  This is a film that remains true to the political discourse of its source material and not one that compromises substance in order to maximize its appeal.  <p>Branagh is a standout as Henry and he is well supported by a talented ensemble cast.  Robbie Coltrane, Christian Bale, Judi Dench, and Paul Scofield are the more recognizable names to mainstream audiences, and Emma Thompson is enchanting as Katherine.  The closing scenes of the film between Branagh and Thompson work very well and there is a genuine chemistry between the two.  To watch these two performers distinguish themselves so well opposite each other is truly inspiring.  To those of you who have dismissed Shakespeare after only sampling his written works, try taking a look at "Henry V."  This film might help you develop a newfound appreciation for the man and his works.
 | product/productId: 0780620445 | review/userId: A39T7TMQXZ93YL | review/summary: Winning at Life! | review/text: SHINE is a truly inspiring film about how one musician, David Helfgott, overcomes his domineering father and the unforgiving Rachmaninoff 3 to find joy, love and much deserved recognition.<br /><br />David's first obstacle is his father, Peter Helfgott, who repeatedly bullies his son to 'always win' and then repeatedly denies him the ability to do so by abusing him and preventing him from getting proper teaching abroad.<br /><br />When David escapes his abusive father to study at the Royal College of London, he finds another cruel master, Rachmaninoff 3, perhaps the most difficult of piano pieces.  Practicing night and day allows him to overcome this obstacle- but at a heavy price- it is indelibly etched in his soul.<br /><br />He descends into maddness- in which he continually fingers Rachmaninoff, and even starts speaking in a fast, stuttering fashion (perhaps based on the piece), forgets 'important' things such as putting on his clothes.<br /><br />While David never fully overcomes his illness, it doesn't matter.  As the film moves on, it becomes clear that neither his father nor Rachmaninoff 3 could conquer his ebullient spirit.  Returning to the piano years later (by wandering into a bar) he wins instant recognition for his virtuoso performance.  Later, his charming but humble personality delights a wealthy astrologist, Gillian Murray.  They marry, and with her support he returns to the concert scene, and fame.  More importantly, he lives with joy- not being afraid of jumping up and down on a trampoline or running with abandon on the beach, or putting his shoes on backward.<br /><br />Peter Helfgott wanted his son to win piano competitions.  David ends up winning so much more- he wins by leading a life filled with joy and love, and by inspiring others to do the same.

 | product/productId: 5554347533 | review/userId: ABUZT5MJQZZP3 | review/summary: Final Destination (Blu-Ray & DVD) | review/text: The Final Destination Series is a successful horror series. It is one of those series that will probably continue making sequels (FD5 is supposed to release in Summer 2011). Well, I love the Final Destination series, they are entertaining - not very scary, but the deaths are very interesting. I personally favor the 3rd and 1st movie, while 2 and 4 are my least favorite - but I still like them! Well, I was shopping in this DVD store that is closing down and they had "Final Destination 1" on Blu-Ray for $12.99 with an 80% off discount. The Blu-Ray was only $2.50 in the end. The Blu-Ray is the Canadian edition, but it's exactly the same as the USA Blu-Ray release - same special features, ect. The only difference is that it has 18A instead of an R-Rating.<br /><br />DVD review:<br />The quality is excellent (for an older DVD release). The movie is enjoyable and fun to watch. There's two different kinds of packaging. One is a Snapper (I believe it includes both Widescreen & Fullscreen), the other is a Widescreen Standard DVD case. In the end, it's a great movie - with lots of special features.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review:<br />The quality is pretty good (better than the DVD). The Blu-Ray has grain as well.

Some of the acting was very average as well as the screenplay itself. Never the less, John Boorman did a spectacular jod directing. Several scenes for very powerful.Including the  final battle with Mordred. I also thought that the scoring was effective.  This film may seem visualy dated now, but it does not matter. If you are a  big fan of the Arthurian legend, this is a must see.

 | product/productId: 6300216748 | review/userId: A1YY2LFLCBL3QY | review/summary: Good but not a full story | review/text: Three Days of the Condor is a simple story. Secret agent bookworm comes back to his HQ to find everyone dead. A hit that was supposed to get him as well. He quickly discovers that it's his own government out to get him. So what does he do? He kidnaps a beautiful woman and forces her to help him, who quickly falls in love with him, as he tries to figure this one out. That's the basic story. What's missing is the bigger picture. The movie starts off to abruptly that it takes a while before we get a clear picture of just who Redword's character (Condor) is, what he does, and why this is significant.<br /><br />The movie's saving grace, ironically, is the assassin who is sent to kill Condor. It is his view on the situation, and Condor, that really makes this an interesting movie. If only Redford wasn't a real life communist he'd make some exceptional spy thrillers.

 | product/productId: 6302023769 | review/userId: A2TOU0N8XE68W4 | review/summary: Excellent early Elizabeth Taylor adult role | review/text: I've always loved this film. I constantly feel that it is unfairly dismissed as a jungle soap opera but it has so many very good things going for it. I feel it was a very important early adult film role for Elizabeth and certainly gives an indication of all the stunning roles coming up for her soon like &quot;Giant&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; etc. She gives here an excellent performance and absolutely holds her own against Dana Andrews and Peter Finch.<br />The look of the film is spectacular and Elizabeth has never been more lovely. I wont retell the saga of Elizabeth replacing Vivien Leigh here again as other reviewers have mentioned it already, bu tthe film does benefit from the stunning on location photography in Ceylon which adds richly to the films quality. Abraham Soefar has a superb role as the mystical and haughty man servant who at first despises but then grows to appreciate Elizabeth's character through plague and then of course the spectacular elephant stampede at the finale which is without doubt &quot;Elephant Walk&quot;s most famous scene. It is a stunner and well worth the wait.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; for all of you who,  like me, love Elizabeth Taylor and know what a fine actress she is. An excellent film to sit back and enjoy....they don't make 'em like this any more!!

Rivers to cross, deaths to face, cliffs to lower animals and wagons down and all sorts of weather changes.  It was not a life for the 'faint of heart'.  John Wayne looks almost like a teenager in this movie he is so young.
 | product/productId: 5554454577 | review/userId: AYG1U47VFZ165 | review/summary: OK, Maybe It's Not the Best ... | review/text: ... the ALIEN 3 has been bashed for many years for being simply that; an inferior follow-up to two great first installments in the saga.  Certainly, everyone can concede that it would be extraordinarily difficult to match up to the sheer scare power of ALIEN or ALIENS, and ALIEN 3 deserves a second look on its own merits.<p>That said, this outing finds Lt. Ripley crash-landing onto a prison world, where she faces a cadre of lustful killers who -- in an odd twist of fate -- are already too late: a seed has been planted inside her, and it's her worst nightmare come true.  Ellen Ripley carries an infant alien, the next generation of horror, and thus ensues the race against time to battle both a full-size predator on the loose, the one germinating inside our heroine, and the evil forces of the company who've learned that there's still an alien out there for them to the world of business.<p>In one tidy little package, ALIEN 3 is a well-paced allegory for all that Ripley has feared.  Standing alone, it's a nice little film -- not a great one -- that probably has been stripped by fandom of its ability to be just that: one nice little scare.  Being part of a trilogy (well, until the next installment anyway) where the first two parts equal a sum far greater than ALIEN 3 could match, its swallowed up like prey.

Just want to point out that this film was shot in 1.33:1 ratio, and the full-screen version is the way to go. The widescreen version actually removes visual information from the top and bottom of the picture. You can see this if you compare scenes from the included preview (widescreen) with the same scenes in the full-screen feature.

 | product/productId: 6300230317 | review/userId: AVF60NZ99H9D5 | review/summary: entertaining and funny | review/text: First off, though, you'll want to go along with the fact this zero budget wonder was made with no money, etc. and you'll see plenty of flaws. It was shot on Super 8 (film, not video) and it shows...I found it entertaining and am a big Mark Pirro fan. This is someone who loves film and it shows. Most Hollywood comedies are not only not funny, but painful to sit through--because nothing works in them, and there you are wondering where  the millions went and what was it for?...<br /><br />Like I said: it's zero budget, so don't expect Groundhog Day or It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, etc. but if you can accept and appreciate it for what it is and the arduous conditions the filmmaker had to work under (his main lead Eddie Deezen dropped out midway through and Pirro had to step in as Dupah, the young vampire) you'll have a good time.<br /><br />I have always felt that if the talented Pirro were given a decent budget that he would be able to turn out something pretty...solid--and who knows, one day it just might happen. I'd bet on him, and if I had the means I would invest in his films myself. Until then, we have A Polish Vampire In Burbank, among other films that the resilient Mark<br />Pirro has made. We had fun watching this little gem.<br /><br />By the way, Lori Sutton, Dupah's blond girlfriend in the film, is absolutely stunning. Too bad she retired from acting early on. Would love to see her attempt a comeback in another Pirro production one day.

 | product/productId: 6300164993 | review/userId: AN4AR3L5UQHDJ | review/summary: AN ARTIST'S PASSION | review/text: To me, someone who doesn't normally watch miniseries based on Romance novels, the chief value of &quot;Mistral's Daughter&quot; lies in its music score, penned by Vladimir Cosma.  While I don't think much of Mistral as an artist (he's 10 times better than most 20th-century artists--which is not saying much) or of his morals, the music that underlies his creative moments is truly exceptional.  I know of no other theme that so fully captures the GLORY and PASSION of artistic creation--it is lush, it is thrilling, it is unforgettable.  Rachmaninoff would have been proud of it.<br />(Unfortunately, the most extended passage of this theme has been cut from recent TV showings.)
 | product/productId: 6300269426 | review/userId: A1KY8IAFV4P1GZ | review/summary: better than the other reviewers tell | review/text: I won't argue that this is a flawless work.  Ryan O'Neal is just adequate, holding up his end mostly with good looks (as usual).  Kubrick would have done better with an actor Irish in fact and not just in name.  O'Neal is often overwhelmed by the performances around him, and the lack of a good accent is annoying, even to Americans I should think.  That said, there is so much good here that I cannot give it less than five stars.  A couple of scenes bring goosebumps, without any special effects or manipulative music, and this is rare enough in itself to merit any number of stars.  The opening scene at cards is amazing, as is the scene with the German mother and her baby.  The first half of the movie, before Barry becomes a complete cad, is more engaging, but the second half is never boring or hard to watch.  The acting, direction, costumes, lighting, and script are all top-notch.  Kubrick did all he could with the book, I think--except choose a better title actor.  Also, this movie obviously gave the clue to Merchant/Ivory, and we should be grateful for that.  In terms of sympathy, Merchant/Ivory undoubtedly surpassed Kubrick on several occassions, but they never surpassed him in terms of cinematography.  This movie would be difficult to surpass in that regard.
 | product/productId: 6301785398 | review/userId: A3QU0DI7ECID41 | review/summary: Fear this | review/text: There's something very, very wrong with this film.  I bought it off eBay, popped it the VCR and watched it with the lights on for the last half-hour.  I didn't want to--I simply had no choice.  The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is an imperfect reflection of someone's vision, something they themselves saw perfectly clearly...and were, for whatever technical reasons, not quite able to bring to the screen.  There is a plot, certainly--see IMDB.com for the details--and characters whose flaws and strengths seem recognizable enough.  But more importantly, there's a scenario, simple and chilling, whose resonance will keep you awake night after night.  It involves, on some superficial level, avarice and its consequence, but unless you have some masochistic attraction toward insomnia, nerve-shredding unease and chronic anxiety, you have no business watching this &quot;film.&quot;  Avoid it, or endure the consequences of sleeplessness and creeping fear that leaves you staring at the ceiling while your partner dozes peacefully throughout the night.  It's the kind of movie that someone makes after they've been living with a certain, very specific version of truth all their lives, and are given exactly eighty-eight minutes of footage to alert the rest of the planet.  It's not entertainment. It's a warning.
 | product/productId: 0784011206 | review/userId: A1S2GLK5CM8HLI | review/summary: I'll give you a war you won't believe! | review/text: I remember seeing this movie on HBO as a kid after my parents went to bed early one night. It left its mark on me. As I've grown older I've come to love this film. I read the book it was based on and although it's different (ie, Rambo dies in the end by the hand of his mentor Trautman,his escape by dirt bike actually takes place with him being naked and having to supply himself from local mountain men, he's also more of a hippie in the novel whereas in the film he's a &quot;full blooded combat soldier&quot;), but that isn't such a bad thing.<br />I really think that critics don't enough credit to Stallone for his performance in this film especially when it pertains to the final scene between Rambo and Trautman where he breaks down emotionally and recounts all of the horrors of war he has seen first hand and how special he was in Nam, but as a civilian he can't get a job parking cars. The desperation and pain he portrays as he practically begs to be forgiven for becoming a killing machine is like a son asking to be forgiven by his father.<br />I've spoken with a lot of vets at Veteran's Hospitals and VFW's over the years as a volunteer and they always mention that in my conversations with them that this film was step in the healing process to some of them and their families. That it helped them come to as what Col. Trautman calls &quot;Full Circle&quot;.<br />One of the best extras that I can think of is actually a commentary by the author David Morrell. It helps to explain a lot of the details that usually are glossed over in action films and makes the experience more emotionally exciting.

 | product/productId: 0790729687 | review/userId: AP4XZSL238EN1 | review/summary: A Good Movie | review/text: This movie is a favorite of mine, though I do not give it the five star rating, because it is not perfect by any means.  I read this book and the books that followed because of this movie.  While it does not follow the book exactly (the whole thing with Louis's brother, Lestat's father, Lestat in Paris) it does an excellent job.  There are lots of little things that make me truly love this movie that Queen of the Damned forgot about.  There is the part where Louis is sitting staring into the candle while Lestat throws grapes at him, out of the entire movie this scene is probably the best when it comes to showing the relationship between these characters.  There is also the part where Louis is burning down the house and Lestat breaks through the window and they fight to which Lestat responds "Shut up, Louis!"<p>Claudia is amazing.  While in the books she is younger than six, here she is about 12, but the fact is you could never find a six year old child with that type of range.  Her performance is amazing and truly portrays Claudia as the amazing and disturbing character she is.<p>Armand is the most disappointing, while Antonio takes a noble stab, his appearances is almost the total opposite of Armand.  Armand is short, has auburn hair, and is very young being about 16 or 17.<p>Christian Slater does an excellent job as Daniel Molloy (the reporter).  The end, however, is a tad bit aggravating to those fans of the book. Needless to say, there is no part in the car with Lestat. (I will admit, this is a part I enjoy, but far from the book.)<p>Many of the women I know who enjoy this movie are in it mainly for the top stars and any excuse to watch them.  If you are watching it for this reason you may be disappointed as both are in quite a good deal of make-up, which may or may not add to your appreciation of their looks.  If you are coming in strictly with a huge love for the books you might also be disappointed.  Things as I have mentioned have been changed or cut entirely.  However, if you come into this movie strictly because you want to watch a good vampire movie than this is a good one for you.  While not the typical vampire action movie (if you are looking for that, watch Blade) it is more thinking and gives a better idea of what it might actually be like to live as a vampire.  If you are looking for more fun, less thought, and wild music watch Queen of the Damned.  What you think of this movie is all a matter of what you are looking for.  <p>This movie is unashamedly dark.  If you are not a fan of dark and depressing movies do NOT see this because you will not enjoy it.  However, if you have an appreciation for the dark things of life and story lines this is probably the movie for you.<p>(This is my first review of anything, so be kind!)

 | product/productId: 6302048818 | review/userId: A2QTWKGJKZAU2Y | review/summary: La Mancha - a hit | review/text: I have always been a huge fan of musical theatre and film and I've seen most of them from the old MGM films to most recently "Phantom".<br /><br />For some reason I had not seen the film of "La Mancha". I had seen the play both as an ameteur production some 20 years ago, which I loved and a huge professional production in Sydney a couple of years ago. I have never been dissappointed in these. I avoided the film because like "My Fair Lady" it was important that the cast could sing and could not face listening to those great numbers suffering from poor vocal interpretation (Why didn't Julie Andrews play 'Eliza' in the film will remain one of the great miscastings of all time!). However I viewed the film version finally this weekend and brother what a stunner. All the cast a exceptional notably O'Toole and Loren, who bowled me over with their bravada performances and the magnificent production values. There hasn't been many musicals I've seen lately that nail the essence of the show as well as this film does. I even coped with the deletion of a couple of great songs such as 'Aldonza's "Why does he do the things he does" and the re-writing/editing of Aldonz'a great "10:30" number. Still these minor changes make no difference to the impact this movie has. WOW!<br /><br />The DVD transfer if fine, no complaints there. I just wish there had been some 'extras' included. If you haven't seen it and like some meaning to your 'musical' viewing, I highly recommend this!

The plot is pretty good with John Wayne leading the action. William Holden plays the doctor who opposes the Duke on more than one occasion. Their interaction is solid, and adds a nice edge to the movie.<br /><br />A few of the plot twists are a bit odd, to include the love interest, but the action scenes more than make up for this diversions. The final battle scene is especially well done. My kids loved it.<br /><br />If you like John Wayne movies, the Horse Soldiers is a solid choice. It will keep you entertained throughout.
 | product/productId: 076780161X | review/userId: AV5G37VFE5NVD | review/summary: The best sequel of the Showa series | review/text: There have been three "series" of Godzilla movies: the Showa series, which includes all films released from 1954-1975, the Heisei series, which includes all films released from 1984-1995, and the Millennium series, which includes all films released from 1999-2004.  The Showa series holds all the classics, and excluding the original, nothing is more classic than 1964's MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA.  Much like GOLDFINGER (released the same year), which was almost universally considered to be the finest James Bond film prior to the release of CASINO ROYALE, by all explanations MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA shouldn't be so good.  Nevertheless, it is inexplicably the finest sequel in the Showa series.<br /><br />The plot involves a mysterious giant egg that washes up on the shores of Japan, attracting the attention of greedy businessmen who "purchase" the egg.  Meanwhile, a scientist, a reporter, and a rookie photographer are trying to discover what the egg really belongs to when they encounter two small fairies, who tell them that the egg is Mothra's egg.  Mothra is, of course, a giant moth, who made her debut in her own kaiju flick, 1961's MOTHRA (also directed by the great Ishiro Honda).  Though the trio tries to convince the businessmen to return the egg to Mothra, they will do no such thing.  Then who emerges to liven things up but the Big G himself, looking more ferocious than he did before or did in any film afterwards.  Can Mothra protect her egg and save Japan from the menace of Godzilla, or will Japan's worst (and biggest) enemy be having scrambled eggs for his next entree?<br /><br />Ishiro Honda really knew what he was doing with this film.  The pacing is perfect: not too rushed, but not slow to the point where one begins screaming for a monster to pop up and wreak some havoc.  The screenplay is humorous and very fun, and Akira Ifukube's music is spectacular.  The Godzilla suit used for this film, "Mosugoji", is a fan favorite due to its more nasty, reptilian look.  Mothra herself is a seemingly silly opponent, but her battle(s) with Godzilla are surprisingly interesting.  The best scene of the film is Godzilla's first appearance, sudden, with no foreshadowing.  I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen the film, but it's my favorite Godzilla entrance ever.<br /><br />I cannot congratulate Sony Wonder enough for their recent Godzilla DVD releases.  For a longtime fan like me, they're a dream come true - gorgeous packaging, delectable restoration, sumptuous bonus features, and both the Japanese AND English version (the English version of MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA, titled GODZILLA VS. THE THING, actually contains extra footage not in the Japanese version!).  It's quite the package; if you're a Godzilla fan, don't hesitate to pick it up.  MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA is the best sequel of the Showa series, and a reminder of just how fun "evil Godzilla" was before the series descended into silliness with the subsequent entries.

The reasons most often mentioned include the grainy black and white pseudo-documentary filming, the heretofore unbroken taboo of onscreen cannabalism, the bold decision to use a black man as the protagonist, and the dreary ordinariness of the zombies.  Certainly, the sum of these factors makes it easy to tag this film as something special in the horror genre.  Yet for NOTLD, the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.  There are other films in other genres that had talented directors consciously try tactics that would appeal to the immediate senses of the viewer.  What separates the merely effective film from the truly memorable one is what the director presents as lurking beneath the surface.  In the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock is the acknowledged master of the subconscious demon that lurks in us all. George Romero, the director of NOTLD, surely runs a close second. What Romero manages to do in NOTLD is similar to what Ridley Scott managed a decade later in ALIEN.  Romero knew that walls and claustrophobia often interact on the screen to produce a creepy feeling in the audience.  In fact, walls and wall-breaking become the central metaphor of this film. As the movie opens, a zombie attacks a woman who seeks safety in her car.  The zombie tries to break in by smashing the car's window. The woman seeks safety in a house, and with the aid of other normal humans, seeks to buttress the structural integrity of the house by using nails and boards.  Soon enough a horde of slow-moving corpses tries to smash into the house.  Eventually they succeed. The grotestque climax occurs when the recently murdered brother of the woman reaches through a smashed door and drags his poor screaming sister out into the night to be devoured.  The cumulative impact of this scene scares the viewer on more than one level.  The horror of seeing a sister ripped apart by her ghoul brother is surely nasty enough, but Romero amplifies this grotesqueness by suggesting that the malevolent events of this movie are nothing more than an exaggeration of a fundamental principle of life--that the order and stability of this universe has only the thinnest of gossamer protection against the terror and chaos that exists just inches from that wall. It is almost as if Romero is suggesting that the nightmares which afflict us all are only glimpses into that anarchic nada which preceeded the origins of our universe.  If a nightmare glimpse scares the ordinary individual, then, he shows on the screen what the grim reality of a wall collapse must be like.  This other nightmare universe sucks us into its foul regions where the dead are not dead at all.  By the end of the film, the audience is forced to see that the dramatic focus of the title is not on the living at all, but on the dead.  And it is this soul-shaking divination that causes a new generation of audiences to continually reappraise the sometimes elusive distinction between that which is dead and that which is not.

However, this movie was brilliant and no one should go without seeing this!  The story follows the character, Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo), an ex-con.  He was jailed for a couple years for betting money that he didn't have, on a football game.  Before he went to jail, he told his parents that he was working for the govenment, so they never knew he was arrested. Anyway, on the first day he is released from jail, he temporarily kidnaps a dancer, Layla (Christina Ricci), and presents her to his parents as his wife.  Soon, Layla and Billy fall inlove.  I, perosnally, thought this film was a masterpiece and very entertaining.  I highly reccomend this one!
 | product/productId: 0783229747 | review/userId: A3LU79BYMWZEW9 | review/summary: Not Exactly Type Casting | review/text: I recall that when Meryl Streep was doing publicity for this film a few years ago, she cracked that when she first got the script, she assumed that she would be playing the daughter. In point of fact, if the film had been made twenty years before, she would have been perfect for the part of the ambitious young journalist, whose father virtually drafts her to return home and care for her deathly ill mother. Streep's patrician good-looks, her sharp features and cool air would have been perfect for the young Ellen Gulden.<p>Not that's she's bad as a suburban matron--Streep can pretty much pull any role off with aplomb. As the dutiful wife of self-obsessed English professor with literary aspirations, she never rings a false note. And it's remarkable that when she complains about how female faculty members in her husband department often seem to look down their noses at a "mere" faculty wife, it rings true. Streep, of course, radiates intelligence, and there is a certain irony in the fact that her character is made to feel less than adequate, at least momentarily, when in fact she is likely the intellectual equal of any of them.<p>As far as casting somewhat against type goes, there has been considerable discussion over the choice of Renee Zellweger to portray the ambitious journalist daughter. Well, aside from the fact that she looks nothing like Streep (though she could pass for William Hurt's child, I suppose), she is actually much better in the part than I would have guessed. We should not assume that all young women journalists are tough-as-nails dames who never betray an emotion. Zellweger actually reminds me a little of the author of the novel on which this film was based (and who also contributed to the screenplay). Anna Quindlen herself has always seemed to me to be an affable soul in many ways. Doesn't mean that she can't make a deadline or hold her own in a smoke filled room.<p>A good word should be added for William Hurt's work here. He could easily have just come off as the villain in this piece. He is certainly capable of being an insensitive clod, but Hurt does bring a certain pathos to his character and certainly would have developed him more had he had just a little more screen time.

I wasn't sure what to expect never having ordered used DVD's before. They were classified as "like new" and were priced at half the going rate of my local stores. The DVD's I received were in fact like new. The quality was excellent, delivery was as scheduled and the price was great. I am a satisfied customer and would buy from them again. Also it is a great show you should check it out.
 | product/productId: 6301966988 | review/userId: A60C7WQTG5R52 | review/summary: One of the Best Movies of All Time | review/text: This movie has a little everything that will appeal to just about everyone.  There's plenty of comedy, lots of romance, a bit of action and suspense and a more or less happy, tear-jerker ending.  Not to mention the beauty of a young Demi Moore.  And as a plus, the paranormal aspect gets plausible treatment.  If you haven't seen this, I say you 'must'.  Go out and buy it to watch over and over.
 | product/productId: 0788806270 | review/userId: A2MHJJ4HXN8X40 | review/summary: Perfection in animation for the whole family | review/text: I didn't see Bambi in the theaters until I was in college and I remember being blown away by the animation in it.  This restoration has renewed my admiration for the animators who worked on this film.  The animation looks almost 3-D in it's use of the multiplane camera technique.  The colors are brilliant and the soundtrack is even more glorious than I remembered.  Yes, there are a few slow parts to the film, but scene of Bambi on the ice is hilarious and the excitement of the forest fire and Bambi and his father's escape from it will keep you riveted to the screen. One very curious thing I noticed in the extras disc, the film was originally marketed as a love story. Anyway, the extras keep you interested in the techniques used to draw the film and how it was restored.  A must have for any family, or kid at heart like me.

I saw it as a young child--when it first came out, grew up with the MP music books and repeated viewings of Mary Poppins.<br /><br />I ordered the VCR tape approximately 20 years ago at a premium price.  I am still using it.  My 3 sons grew up with Mary Poppins, learning each and every line to the songs and script.  They played "Mary Poppins".  Now my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter is the biggest fan--2-3 times a day the video is viewed.  I purchased 2 sets of the DVDs as well as the music CDs for 2004 Christmas. Our granddaughter sings to the music, knows each scene and hushes us as not to miss a particular song. She does the Spit-Spot mirror scene-hand gestures and all!<br /><br />Mary Poppins--is wonderful!
 | product/productId: 6302270464 | review/userId: A1DMTXRMQNI94U | review/summary: GREAT MOVIE about a GREAT MAN | review/text: This was the first movie I had seen of John Barrymore. Unfortunately you can see the ware that his real life alcohol problem had on him by that time. I read where he could not remember his lines and had to read them off of cue cards throughout the whole movie. But I will tell you, history is right about one thing. John Barrymore was and still is one of the greatest character actors that there ever was. Being an alcoholic, he is actually drunk (in real life) throughout this movie. And yet he can still pull off a prize winning performance. This is a great movie and a great way to meet John Barrymore.
 | product/productId: 6302178940 | review/userId: A2L718VM8KLDAO | review/summary: Totally bad, totally fun. | review/text: Let's be honest, Chuck Norris movies are bad.  Pretty much all of them are bad enough to be good.<br /><br />"Behind Chuck Norris' beard, there is no chin... there is only another fist"<br /><br />You know, its just like watching all the Schwartzeneger movies, just for the one-liners.<br /><br />I think Chuck Norris is pretty much the poster boy (better say poster "destroyer" instead of "boy" just in case he finds out i wrote this writeup and comes and kicks my ass) for the tough-guy cop.<br /><br />You gotta see in the beginning of this movie, when Chuck challenges one of this pimp's sidekicks to hit him in the face, so he can show no emotion or pain as a result - "you call that a hit?".  He then punches the guy back so he fly's over the hood of the car.  Hilarious.<br /><br />Well, you know exactly what you're in for when you go watch a Chuck Norris movie.  Pretty much an hour and a half of that.  Its totally fun.<br /><br />I think Chuck should make an appearance in the next Starsky & Hutch-stlye comedy film.  It would be great.<br /><br />The plot is the following:  An evil spawn of the devil named Prosatanos, is unleashed onto the earth.  Chuck and his sidekick cop are out to find and destroy him, while overcoming all the human obstacles in the way.  Actually the plot gets a little more complicated than that, involving the crown of some scepter, and royal blood.<br /><br />But in the year 2006, you're not watching Chuck Norris movies for depth, but pure comedy instead.<br /><br />Had it not been for his seriousness, the movies wouldn't be near as fun a decade or so down the line.<br /><br />Ayways, pure comedy is what you'll get.  The movie is brilliant.<br /><br />Buy it.  Rent it.  Whatever.  You gotta see it.

 | product/productId: 0790741172 | review/userId: A1JQ6E8ZY3I3V0 | review/summary: Is it really "Right" for you? | review/text: Sure, "The Right Stuff" is one of the most epic and compelling movies ever made.  And the overwhelming majority of us have watched it with rapt attention...at least once, if not several times.  But, in the tradition of "Why leave anything alone, when we can throw in some extras, repackage it as a "Special Edition", and persuade folks that it is worth shelling out another $20 for"...<p>It's not even worth discussing the movie itself, because we are all familiar with its grand tale of 7 men with "the right stuffh and their involvement with the Mercury Program in the early 60's during the beginning of the "space race".<p>The two disc special edition consists of the original film on one disc (finally placed completely on one side, as opposed to the original "flipover"), and a disc of special features that were definitely lacking (missing entirely, as a matter of fact) from the original DVD release.  Although it's nice to have special features as a compliment to the movie, it would be even nicer if they were as special as they could have been.  <p>A couple of short documentaries, while not going in-depth on the making of the film, are a collection of reminiscences from cast, crew, the remaining Mercury astronauts, and Chuck Yeager.  The 15 minutes of gextra scenes" are basically cutting room scraps, not possessing any of the details or beauty of the actual film.  In many cases, the extra scenes don't even appear to fit properly into any particular spot in the film (which is probably why they were cut).  There is a 25-minute section of  "selected" scenes where you can hear commentary by EITHER the cast or the crew, which are actually enlightening and amusing...but the logical move would have been to include a commentary track (or 2) for the entire film.  There is also a very lame "interactive timeline" for the space program...12 or so listed dates that you click on to get a 10 second video blurb or a 2 screen text description of the event.  Although itfs nice that these were included in the set, there isn't anything overly "special" about any of these features.  <p>However... as the final special feature, there is a 90-minute PBS production on John Glenn: American Hero, which is interesting, informative, and downright attention grabbing.  Incredibly well done, it focuses on the one member of the Mercury Team who has actually remained in the public spotlight for 40+ years, from his younger years, up to his return to space as part of a shuttle mission in 1998.<p>If you already own the original release DVD, it is probably not worth it to upgrade just for the sake of getting the special features.  But, if you have never owned this classic before on DVD, it is worth every penny, and can definitely be considered the "right stuff".

 | product/productId: 6300183971 | review/userId: A22KFR9FW0RCIS | review/summary: Nothing like the book | review/text: In 2004, I finally read Dune. Awesome story and I plan to read it again someday. Movies often fail to meet up to the book they are based upon and this is no exception, in my opinion. Maybe I am mesmerized by all the amazing special effects in movies these days, but I actually laughed much through this movie. I realize the story is complicated and long, but the 1984 version just doesn't cut it. I would LOVE to see a remake of this, not so much for updated special effects (the worms were great in the 1984 version) but for a more engaging storyline. Like LOTR, one is going to appreciate the movie much more if they've read the book, but LOTR followed the books quite well, IMO, AND they came out with movies that awed even non-book-readers. I think DUNE could be like that.
 | product/productId: 1559409002 | review/userId: A1PASRZ81DY9C | review/summary: Sleepy Like a Sedative. | review/text: Viewed: 4/05, 5/05, 11/07<br />Rate: 4<br /><br />4/05: After viewing Carnival of Souls, I found the film very murky and too abstract. I was expecting a thrilling horror movie, but I felt Carnival of Souls was short of its presentation in the story. My feeling also is that there was a link between Henry James' story The Turn of the Screw and Carnival of Souls, somewhat voiding the originality in the film Carnival of Souls. Sidney Berger gave a delicious performance as John Linden, the creep who was badgering the leading female character. Although obvious in his manners, it was very enjoyable to watch him in his quest. Overall, the story was weak as the quality of the picture, notably for artistic purposes, was lackadaisical. While finding Carnival of Souls too abstract, it is easy to think of Alfred Hitchcock and imagine what wonders he can do with the film. It is attention-grabbing to see that Carnival of Souls, made for $30,000, has given me a consideration to view it again, to see if I can regard the film in a better light. It was a difficult viewing for the first time and for me trying to sink in everything about Carnival of Souls. By the way, Carnival of Souls is an appropriate title due to the idea of the film. A post note as I learned this: "At various festivals and appearances he can often be heard quoting critic Roger Ebert's comment on his character in Carnival of Souls. Ebert called Berger's character the `definitive study of a nerd in lust,' a feat Berger often boasts about humorously." That's a high praise and rightfully so.<br /><br />5/05: Carnival of Souls is a slow and sluggish picture. No surprise, there is not much of a story. Sidney Berger is superb once again. The colorization of Carnival of Souls helped to elevate the art of the movie. But, the whole time, I felt like sleeping.<br /><br />11/07: Once again, I view Carnival of Souls and still think it's not a very good picture. Obviously, Carnival of Souls moves very slowly, even for a picture that literally has almost no plot to speak of. I start to notice how badly the acting is from the cast members. My opinion of Sidney Berger is changing big time as I am incessantly annoyed by his poor acting. He was more of a smug this time around instead of being a Buddy Griffith of Just One of the Guys. Sure, Carnival of Souls is a pretty black-and-white picture but has no energy whatsoever. I have already gotten the plot figured out very early, or probably due to repeated viewings, so there wasn't much motivation for me to find any practical value out of the film. I can see how Carnival of Souls is influential because of one simple concept: get the zombies out. That's goldmine...not. Yes, I know the psychological aspects coming out of Candace Hilligoss' character, but please...give me a break. I'll get that out of Vertigo when I feel like it. The reason I didn't give Carnival of Souls less than a `4' is because I've seen worse and have been more bored out of my mind. At the look of the amount of money spent on this film, I got to give credit to Herk Harvey. Carnival of Souls isn't totally that bad, but it's not entertaining by any means.

Illustrated history of a great gun used by many countries and revered more than any pistol in history by collectors.  From the early test trials with the US Army, through footage of its unique and extremely fast toggle action, and describing some of the many, many variations of this fine gun, to firing a Million dollar one of a kind Luger, to modern production still on going of this classic firearm, ultimately to the world reknown Luger dealer Ralph Shattuck.  This segment of the Tales of the Gun shows a brief glimse into the history and use of this fasinating pistol.  The shooting sequences are amazing.  Good enough for the German Army, Airforce, and Navy, this fantasic marvel of German Engineering still amazes many even today!  Segments of information from Fred Datig, Charlie Kenyon, Michael Krause, Garry James and Ralph Shattuck all reknown experts are included. Terrific History Documentation of the first order!

 | product/productId: 6300185206 | review/userId: A1GF7BR6K22GZD | review/summary: "WHAT'S  KNITTIN'  , KITTENS?" | review/text: Very funny farce written and directed by Preston Sturges. Jerry (Claudette Colbert) runs away from engineer husband Tom (Joel McCrea) after feeling she's in the way of his success and tired of being poor. The Wienie King (don't ask) gives her $700. She spends it and flees to Palm Beach for a divorce with no money and no clothes. On the train, after the Ale & Quail Club pay her fare (don't ask), she is hounded by the rowdy (and I mean ROWDY) bunch until the conductor is forced to abandon the car! Then she steps on and  meets "Snoodles" Hackensacker (Rudy Valee) a stiff as starch but charming multimillionaire who buys her clothes and lets her stay at his Palm Beach mansion with his husband hunting sister (Mary Astor) and her "guest" a bizarre French (?) kook who's always falling down. Then Tom shows up (after also meeting the Wienie King) and then everything gets even crazier. Alternately funny, romantic, sexy (oh yes) and surreal, this overlooked gem is packed with rapid fire dialogue, double entendres and just plain lunacy. "Palm Beach Story" must have been very adult for the time (1942) because it still tickles in the right places. Colbert's costumes are stunning and she is delightful as Jerry. The DVD print is very good. Enjoy. And try to figure out the opening title sequences....

 | product/productId: 0783114222 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: Almost as exciting as what we lived through way back when | review/text: When I was in the first grade in Orlando, Florida our class would go outside to watch the Mercury flights take off from Cape Canaveral, so the American space program made a big impression on me as a child.  Of course, now I have a daughter who is surprised to learn that human beings have walked on the moon while I remember "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." being interrupted by a news bulletin about the fatal fire that killed the crew of Apollo 1.  My father was stationed in Japan for most of the Apollo flights, so except for Apollo 11 we did not get to see a lot of what everybody saw back home.  Consequently, for me "From the Earth to the Moon" is a combination of vague memories and new information.<br /><br />Having also watched "Band of Brothers," the other HBO documentary in which Tom Hanks had a significant hand, I am struck by how these two mini-series have essentially redefined the term more towards its original meaning.  Unlike landmark mini-series such as "Shogun" and "Winds of War," where each episode picks up the main characters pretty much where they were left at the end of the previous episode, "From the Earth to the Moon" and "Band of Brothers" clearly offer up distinct episodes in telling the story of the Apollo space program.  The only constant characters are really Eugene Cernan (Daniel Hugh Kelly), the astronaut who ended up heading the program, and the fictional television anchorman Emmett Seaborn (Lane Smith), who represents an amalgam of all the newscasters who were big boosters of the space program (such as Walter Cronkite).<br /><br />Most of the episodes focus on a specific Apollo flight, but there are also episodes on different topics, like the development of the lunar module.  There are episodes that of surprising comedy, such as when the crazy Pete Conrad (Paul McCrane) takes Al Bean (Dave Foley) and Apollo 12 to the moon, and one devoted to the pathos of the shattered lives of the wives of the third group of Astronauts.  The episode on Apollo 13 is interesting in how it effectively avoids covering the same ground as the movie.  We never see the astronauts, we only hear their voices, and since we all "know" the story now the focus of the episode is to show how the space program was confronted with the "new" brand of journalism that was not going to be spoon fed information and heroes by NASA.  However, my favorite was the episode in which Lee Silver (David Clennon), a professor of geology, teaches the astronauts how to read the story of rocks as the test pilots being sent to the moon learn to be "scientists."  There are lots of familiar faces in these episodes (the proverbial too many to name), but for those who remember the indelible bad boy characters created by McCrane and Clennon on "E.R." and "thirtysomething," there is a special joy in which them play good guys.<br /><br />"From the Earth to the Moon" is not as informative as a documentary, but it certainly focus on the actual nuts and bolts of sending men to the moon.  Actually it does this in a rather engaging manner, and the way in which it combines NASA technology with human drama is one of the strengths of the mini-series.  Almost all of the astronauts come out of the series with their images as heroes intact (providing you do not ask their ex-wives), the exceptions being Buzz Aldrin (Bryan Cranston), who really wanted to get out on the moon before Neil Armstrong (Tony Goldwyn), and Alan Shepard (Ted Levine), who we always knew was the grand old S.O.B. of the space program.  But even so both men merely come across as being decidedly human.  Whether you actually were around at the time to go outside and look up at the moon knowing there were a couple of Americans walking around hitting a golf ball, picking up rocks, and dropping a hammer and a feather at the same time, or this is all just history come alive, you should find this an excellent series of adventures in and about outer space.

It touched something inside of me and is inspiring to me as well as any who watch it. It has EVERYTHING you could ask for in a movie-- emotions,  fighting, war, history, evil, goodness, romance, betrayal, comedy, sadness,  happiness, triumph, anger, beautiful music and scenery, wonderful actors  and actresses--I could go on forever. This movie IS based on a true story,  yet some of the facts depicted in the movie are fiction--for example,  Isabella did not marry Longshank's son until 3 years after Wallace's death.  But in spite of this, I DEFINITELY recommend this movie to all--you should  find at least SOMETHING you enjoy in it! :)
 | product/productId: 6300158683 | review/userId: A11BCJJG91KVOY | review/summary: great movie | review/text: I remember seeing this at Theater 80 St. Marks expecting that it would be a &quot;camp&quot;-y good time.  I was genuinely surprised at how good it was.  Crawford is wonderful as the tough-talking tramp who is &quot;saved&quot; by the Reverend.  She is great at projecting the vulnerability inside Sadie before and during her conversion to penitent, and how, despite her lack of faith in humanity being being well-placed. that that vulnerability remains after her conversion back to tramp.  A great performance that was considered a flop in 1932 (Critics at the time said the role was all but beyond her) that works far better today.  It also give you a whiff of the raw sexuality that Crawford exuded in her early movies that made her the Madonna of her day.  Very much worth seeing.

The script was absolutely horrible.  The acting was absolutely horrible.  The plot was absolutely horrible.  I googled Bram Stoker to find out if indeed there even WAS a Bram Stoker's "Mummy" and haven't found anything he's written with that title...yet...<br /><br />But for some ungodly reason I watched it until the end...at least some of the shots of the city, i.e. the Chronicle truck, the obligatory cable cars, (wow, no Golden Gate Bridge shot) were somewhat accurate...<br /><br />This movie was so bad, I might add it to my collection...it was hysterical in its absurdity and if I can include the Toxic Avenger (I. II AND III!!!) I can certainly have an over-the-top Lou Gossett warding off the curse of whatshisname!!!<br /><br />I laughed until I cried...perhaps it was because of the glass(es) of white zinfandel I sipped while watching...(..hey, lay off..I'm a Raider fan, whaddaya want!!)
 | product/productId: 0783228600 | review/userId: AZKXH0J59TK11 | review/summary: "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" | review/text: I was one of the few that actually saw "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Not because of any affinity for Hunter S. Thompson(who I had never heard of before; forgive me I was fourteen), but after seeing this movie, which is best described as a "flawed masterpiece", I immediatley became a fan of the man, as I am still a fan of this movie.<br /><br />"Fear and Loathing", the movie, isn't flawless, as at times it can get repetitive and I wholly understand the people who say that this movie is nothing but mayhem on film and passed as art. This is not a picture for everyone and the people who do not like it are not wrong and don't neccesarrily "not get it". This movie is made a certain audience.<br /><br />The movie is good, do not let the above paragraph distract you, because it is expertly directed by Terry Gilliam, he of "Monty Python" and "Brazil" fame, who brings his slightly, okay totally, skewred perspective and skills to this film, and the two lead performances from Johnny Depp, who is flawless as "Raoul Duke", a Thompson psuedonym, a performance that isn't just mimicry even though at first it may seem that way, and Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, who some feel is a little over the top, but to me fits the vibe, anarchy for all vibe that the film has.<br /><br />Features wise this is another top notch effort from Crtiterion, featuring three commentaries---one with Gilliam, one with Depp and Del Toro and with the man Thompson himself---, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, an audio recording of Gilliam discussing the controversy over the screenwriting credit, tons of footage with Thompson, and a funny section of Johnny Depp reasing his and Thompson's correspondence with one another. The movie itself looks great, possibly even better than it looked in theaters.<br /><br />If you have yet to see "Fear and Loathing", well, you may wanna watch it before you buy it. But if you dig the flick on any level then this DVD is a must purchase.

The main reason I bought this DVD was for the Alp Dues (stage 16) which is where Lance dominates in an individual time trial.  They show most of the event, cutting out some early parts where the crowd was almost impossible to ride through.  Because of that it only got 4 stars instead of 5.  They cut out what has to be one of the hardest parts of an event like that... all the people in your way... moving at the last second.  The did show some of it, but not the whole thing to give you the real perspective on how crazy it was that day!
 | product/productId: 0790751305 | review/userId: A2W1TK5CJXKH5U | review/summary: Many Unforgiven | review/text: Those who are fans of Clint Eastwood know that when Clint makes a movie, he is always saying something about what he feels a man should be.  "The Unforgiven" in many ways, is one of his best movies and one of the most visual in its depiction of what a man is, and especially, what a man was in the Wild West, and the transitions that man tried to make, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not.<p>His morality is pure in this film.  He is an ex-gunfighter who has seen the good way of the Lord, thanks to his wife.  He is in some financial difficulties, and so, he takes a job that is a "kill for hire" job.  The film portrays beautifully, the conflict within a man, as he faces the option of actually killing another man.  In several ways, Clint makes this point.<p>And while Clint and his partners get paid, it seems a very bittersweet ending as in the process, the great tragedy of the loss of his friend's life to torture occurred.  So little is known really about what makes a person do some of the things they do, and yet, Clint makes these almost ephemeral feelings come to life visually, in this film.<p>In some ways, perhaps Clint's very best film, "The Unforgiven" is not only a wonderful "period piece" but also, truly a statement on the character of people.

Liz and Burton, now married, plays a couple who invites a new younger couple(Sandy Dennis and George Segal) over for a "nightcap" thinking because she's the daughter of the President, things will look good for them, but that thinking is quickly changed when they walk into a unhappy home with a boozy wife, an unhappy professor who though beaten truly knows how to press Liz' buttons for ammunition and it's a fight to the finish, with the innocents in the fray. Not for the upbeat but if you like dramas of this caliber, here it goes and do enjoy!
 | product/productId: 6301095294 | review/userId: A2J8WWG4W0OFYQ | review/summary: The VHS is/was great quality! | review/text: I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it.  I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987.  It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality.  Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album.  So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the "regular" mixes of these songs away.<br /><br />The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced.  Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame.

Based on Roald Dahl's bestselling children's book (in fact, the screenplay was also written by Roald Dahl)  this marvellous tale about a poor little boy who finds one of Willy Wonka's  golden tickets and suddenly finds himself plunged into the most fantastic  thrill of his life will warm the cockles of even the coldest heart.  Not  since &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; has a movie been so rich in fantasy,  imagery, and good old fashioned honesty and love.  You'll be rooting for  Charlie from the first moment of the film till the last!  This is a movie  that will be enjoyed immensely no matter how many times it is watched, and  it will be loved by both the young and the young at heart.
 | product/productId: 6300268748 | review/userId: A2Q13PHEXGR48Q | review/summary: Exciting, star-driven epic portrayal of WWII battle | review/text: Battle of the Bulge is an exciting WWII movie depicting the famous 1944 battle that makes up in action what it lacks in accuracy.  In December 1994, the Allies believe the war is all but over and are preparing to go home.  The Germans are planning one last offensive that will hopefully turn the tide of the war.  The German army breaks through the unsuspecting Allied lines in the Ardennes, but can the outnumbered American divisions hold back the the German advance?  The history here may not be the most accurate, but as the movie states, time has been compressed.  Overall, the battle sequences are very well done on an epic scale with the exception of a few scenes during the tank battle where some very obvious miniatures are used.  Not the most accurate WWII movie, but they got the idea right with American troops standing their ground in hopes of stopping the German advance.<br /><br />  In a cast full of big names, Henry Fonda gets top billing as Lt. Colonel Dan Kiley, an intelligence officer who is convinced the Germans are planning a major offensive.  The versatile Robert Shaw plays Colonel Kessler, the ruthless German commander of the armored spearhead.  Robert Ryan and Dana Andrews star as General Grey and Colonel Pritchard, two Allied officers who don't believe what Kiley tells them.  The huge supporting cast includes George Montgomery and James MacArthur as Sgt. Duquesne and Lt. Weaver, two soldiers who escape the Malmedy massacre, Ty Hardin as Lt. Schumacher, a German paratrooper disguised as an American MP, Charles Bronson as Major Wolenski, Hans Christian Blech as Corporal Conrad, Hessler's aide, and Telly Savalas as Guffy, the tank driver/entrepeneur trying to make a buck.  The DVD includes the widescreen presentation of the movie, an unusually long theatrical trailer, and "The Filming of the Battle of the Bulge" and "History Recreated," two excellent featurettes made during the filming of the movie that contain some great cast and crew interviews.  A long overdue DVD that is a must have for fans of the movie.<br /><br />  The best part of the DVD is that the movie clocks in at just under 170 minutes.  For the longest time, the available versions cut a lot of footage that have been reinserted back into the movie for the DVD release along with intro music, an intermission, and exit music.  After seeing the movie several times with almost a half hour cut, it is really great to see the movie as it was originally intended.  Highly recommended.

Gimme a break!  This movie was chock full of utter nonsense.  It was not believable nor did it suspend my disbelief which is the fundamental rule in movie making.  Instead it called attention to itself at every turn with conspicuous exposition, horrid acting, and bad dialogue.  A screwball from the past like this will normally have some comedic value but this one did not.  I give it 1.5 stars.
 | product/productId: 0800195175 | review/userId: A152C8GYY25HAH | review/summary: Sci-fi adventure is grand entertainment | review/text: If you judge &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; by its plot, it does not measure up to other sci-fi classics. It&#65533;s child-like and absurd, though one could argue that this is part of what makes it so disarming and wondrous. The components that really make it stand out are the glorious sets designs, the spectacular scenes, and the acting. [The performances may not be Oscar-worthy, but they are energetic and slyly amusing.] This is a grand visual treat, and, for once, all the vast amounts of money spent on a movie are truly &#65533;up there on the screen&#65533;. I have seen &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; four or five times, and each viewing brings a new appreciation of just how much thought and effort went into this production. <p>The film starts with a standard sci-fi movie prolog. A team of German archeologists is in Egypt [not again!] uncovering some very odd things. The date is 1914, just before World War I. They have found some sort of shrine to the four elements plus a mysterious fifth element. Suddenly, their work is interrupted by large, strange aliens who announce that they are there to take the stones representing the four elements before war comes. They promise to return them before another force, which is bent on destroying all life in the universe, can do its work. <p>Suddenly the movie switches, not to present day as expected, but to 300 years into the future. The time for the battle between good and evil has arrived. We meet a succession of eccentric, delightful characters. There is Leelou [Milla Jovovich], who is the fifth element &#65533; a beautiful, powerful being who represents the life force. She alone can defeat the forces of death. Korbin Dallas [Bruce Willis] is an ex-army office turned taxi driver. He is unwillingly drawn into the fray and sticks around mainly because of his fascination with Leeloo. We have a ditzy, befuddled priest named Vito Cornelius [Ian Holm] who belongs to an order which has served the forces that protect life for centuries. His assistant is an equally strange young man called Billy [Luke Perry. Finally, we meet Ruby Rhod [Chris Tucker in a role he was born to play], a transsexual TV star who has to be seen to be believed. Together, this unlikely group bands together to fight for all life as we know it. [The human villain is Zorg, played in high camp style by the amazing Gary Oldham.]<p>Besides the movie&#65533;s already mentioned assets, the thing I love about &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; is its refusal to take itself seriously. To me, this makes it far more entertaining than the last two Star Wars films; in fact, it owes more to Daffy Duck than to Darth Vader.  It never expects us to believe the story. It merely tells a very tall tale very well.  <p>The movie was directed by Luc Bresson, who made two of my other favorites &#65533; &#65533;La Femme Nikita&#65533; and &#65533;Leon&#65533;. &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533;, however, belongs in a completely different category, though all three movies have dazzling cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and pulsating music by Eric Serra.

 | product/productId: 0792838300 | review/userId: AGNT23Q1A8UJE | review/summary: Film holds up well | review/text: I just saw this film again and was very impressed at how well its held up against time.  It suffers somewhat from a 1970s modernism (the BMW corporate HQ in Munich was used as a backdrop) in terms of interior design and architecture, but by and large the message of corporatism, the loss of individualism and the public's lust for violence stand out as clear now as they ever have.  There are few science fiction films 25 years old which are capable of this kind of staying power (Star Wars and 2001 are the others) and there are few, if any, other *current* science fiction films which make any clearer or more accurate commentary about our present society.<p>It would have been nice if the film had spent a little more on the backstory behind the settings, but I think this lack of explanation is supposed to help drive Jonathan E's search for meaning.<p>The one scene which remains unclear to me is the party scene where the partygoers take a gun of some sort out and shoot pine trees into flames.  The symbolism of this is lost on me.
 | product/productId: 079284677X | review/userId: A3AY3EV2MFRFGG | review/summary: Semi-classic of hokey horror. | review/text: While far from a success (artistically speaking, the movie was a smash hit at the box office), The Amityville Horror still serves a semi-important place in the haunted house genre (opening the effects laden door on what was once an imagination driven genre) as well as a place in the history of independent cinema, it being the final movie released by the legendary American International Pictures.<p>Based on a supposed true story, the movie undermines its credibility by going for flamboyant (and quite fictionalized) melodrama, especially concerning the priest character played by Rod Steiger, who overacts horribly.  The Stuart Rosenberg directed thriller works best in subtle moments, but those are few and far between as the newly married Lutz's move into a seeming dream house and are confronted with a wide variety of paranormal phenomenon.  Lalo Schifrin contributes an icy, creepy score, but little else lifts this movie above cheap, melodramatic TV movie of the week sensationalism.
 | product/productId: 0783242808 | review/userId: A1GB1Q193DNFGR | review/summary: The Intellectual Porkys | review/text: Paul Wetz has created a suprisingly touching account of modern teenage sexuality. It tells the story of four teenage boys that make a pact that before they graduate from high school they will finally lose their  virinity. At first, the gross sight gags are both hilarious and  distracting. However, the film unexpectedly becomes a moving seriocomic  tale of maleness in the 1990's. The performances by Eugene Levy and Chris  Klein are especially relevant and moving. American Pie is actually a  sophisticated teen character study masquerading as another stupid teen  comedy. See the gags, embrace the characters, and enjoy the insightful  narrative of the Weitz brothers. Beware of the pale ale.

Miracles are a wonderful thing but to actually take part in one must have been the wonders of all wonders.As far as the acting goes, they couldn't get a better actress for this role than Jennifer Jones.  I swear she is the queen of depressed characters. You can always be sure that whatever movie she plays in it will have a sad or sad/happy ending which usually end with tearful eyes.This was a wonderful movie for its time and the acting by everyone is exceptional. If you love spirtual movies as i do this is right at the top of my list next to &quot;The Miracle&quot; 1959 staring Caroll Baker which is my all time favorite to this date.
 | product/productId: 0780608372 | review/userId: A170WXM9JV1I6B | review/summary: GIVE US THE THEATRICAL CUT | review/text: This is a classic movie.  Like few others - The Big Lebowski comes to mind, as does Enter the Dragon - fans the world over know this movie line by line, scene by scene.  Thankfully the Coen Brothers have never issued an alternate cut of The Big Lebowski, and even if they did I'd hope they'd leave the option of watching the theatrical cut so that fans could ignore the changes.  While I have watched the DVD of the theatrical cut of Friday many times, I will not watch this blu-ray again.<br /><br />The alternate scenes only ruin the magic.  The gags are mis-timed and not funny.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that we are eventually given a blu-ray of the theatrical cut of this film, with a decent (non-DNR) transfer, together with the two sequels.<br /><br />The sequels are well worth checking out, and introduce some very funny characters, especially Uncle Elroy and Day-Day.  I'm in the minority that finds the Day-Day character funnier than Smokey, although the scene where Smokey has to pinch a loaf next to his house is a classic many of his scenes are overly hammy.

A blend of great comedians at their finest.  I saw it when I was a teenager in the 90's.  I could not stop laughing.  Chevy Chase barefoot on the golf course, hysterical.  Dangerfield, amazing.  Bill Murray didn't do much for me, but was entertaining, and looking back at it now, he was funny.  Murray in general is one of the greats, of course.<br />Not to be missed.  This is a great intro to some of comedy's heroes for newer generations.

It's about 45 minutes jam-packed with Sesame Street goodness - counting, songs, favorite characters, etc.  Yes, it's pretty dated - I think most of the songs came from 30-40 years ago, but it's still very cute!  Mixed in with the songs and classic clips are scenes from Big Bird, Pairie Dawn and Telly making their own musical on a sunny day in the park.  Highly recommended!
 | product/productId: 6301586050 | review/userId: A1GXU3HQB1598Y | review/summary: In a class of its own | review/text: I had seen this movie in a list of 'must see' classics and, I admit, having read the plot summary I was dubious. I'm a modern woman and don't condone cheating in a relationship; but after coming across "Heaven Can Wait" several times, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />For me the movie was a happy, delightful surprise.<br /><br />The movie looked old-fashioned even in the 40s- this is a story set in ages of leisure made in the middle of WW II when cinemas were full of war hero and action movies. We also share their problem of categorizing the movie. Not an action film. Is it a comedy? No. Romance? Not full on. Drama? Not really. You get the idea. The movie's interest and its problem is that it defies any label.<br /><br />Director Lubitsch also had a problem on his hands making the film: censors. He had more freedom with his movies in the 20s and 30s, but there were a growing number of important story elements he simply couldn't show anymore. How to show audiences a story about a playboy then? Lubitsch cleverly got around this problem by making a movie of all the scenes *in between* the infidelities. The story then become not the infidelities themselves, but how they affect the family and how individual members react to them.<br /><br />In my 20s, I'd've hated this movie. The protagonist Henry would've upset me so much that I wouldn't have cared for the rest of the story. But I'm 40 now, and although I've not had the burden's of Henry's wife, I've had two decades of bumping up against human foibles, some of them my own. I know what it's like to be disappointed by people and have to re-adjust my ideas about when to draw a line and when to forgive.<br /><br />"Heaven Can Wait" appeals to me not on moral ground (how people should be) but on reflective ground (how people are).<br /><br />There is a light, ironic humor throughout the movie. Important I think as otherwise the topic would be too sad and bitter to sit through. Also, it does have the old gender hypocrisy- men get a wink and a nod while the women are condemned. As much as this hypocrisy drives me crazy in real life, it is a testament to how good the movie is that it only detracted a little from my enjoyment of it. And much to my surprise- I enjoyed the movie greatly.

This film supposes that Cornelious and Zira somehow retrieved the ship and repaired it and were able to fly it back through time.  All this was done in the short time from when Brent left their camp in the second film till he reached the mutant camp, which at most was a day).  This was probably the best acting for Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter in the series.  The movie makes us question the scientific use of animals in research.

 | product/productId: 6301338057 | review/userId: A1JH5J1KQAUBMP | review/summary: Serious, fascinating & flawed--but not blasphemous | review/text: This film is a serious, respectful exploration of Christ's dual nature from director Martin Scorcese and screenwriter Paul Schrader.  Here Christ (Willem Dafoe) is fully human, susceptible to all the weaknesses and temptations of man, tormented by his communications with God, which he does not at first understand.  In the beginning, his behavior bears all the symptoms of a man suffering from brain damage or a mental illness--seizures, pain, hallucinations.  Soon, however, he begins to perform miracles and gather disciples, chief among whom is Judas (Harvey Keitel), whose relationship with Jesus is a fascinating revision of what we know of him from the Bible.<br /><br />The power of Scorcese's film is undercut by some pretty serious miscalculations.  Although Dafoe is excellent, much of the cast appears to consist of New York method actors who do not inhabit the time and place of the story convincingly.  The appearance of David Bowie (in the small but significant role of Pontius Pilate) tore me right out of the film.  Peter Gabriel is an excellent musician, but his score, which blends Middle Eastern motifs with rock rhythms and electric guitar, was also a distraction.  In addition, there is a staginess to many of the settings.  Nevertheless, it's definitely worth a look.
 | product/productId: 6300146448 | review/userId: AJKWF4W7QD4NS | review/summary: A B-movie horror classic | review/text: Forget the numerous lame sequels, forget movies like Bad Moon and An American Werewolf in Paris; the original Howling is a masterpiece of B-grade horror ingenuity with some of the best special effects, makeup effects, and creature effects to ever be seen in the 80's.  Director Joe Dante (Gremlins) mixes the film with enough horror, sex, gore, comedy, and various film and genre in jokes to keep enough of the viewer's interest until The Howling reaches it's big shocker finale.  MGM managed to pack a very good amount of special features here (just like they did with their release of The Fog) and should please long time fans of this cult classic.  Look for B-movie (and Dante) favorite Dick Miller, and a cameo from B-movie mogel Roger Corman.
 | product/productId: 0792108868 | review/userId: A1ERE0L96Y00ZL | review/summary: "The Duke" as a real human being | review/text: There is a real resonance to this film that I have seen in few John Wayne movies.  The Duke is still very manly in this film, but most of the macho is gone.  I found myself really getting into Wayne's character, and watching with genuine interest what will happen with his relatonship with Lauren Bacall(still looking great) and Ron Howard.  The Duke didn't seem to be playing a cariacature of himself but something much more real-it doesn't surprise me that he was dealing with real life and death issues in his own life when the film was made.  I kept thinking to myself-"you know, the Duke is really acting in this one!"  Also, the fact that the town was changing to more modern ways in the film is analogous to the fact that Westerns were mostly out of vogue when this picture was made-I think the filmmakers were making their own commentary about that in this movie.  It probably would have been considered too sentimental to give John Wayne an Oscar for "The Shootist," but it would have made perfect sense-his acting is really deserving of an award in his final performance.

Everybody knows there's a lot of crap out there but I just love watching movies.  So this morning after seeing my wife off to work, even after just less than three hours of sleep, I thought I'd slumber myself back to sleep with a movie.  For that purpose, I picked up the wrong one.<p>I won't get into the story of this movie, you get that in the other reviews here.  This, BTW, is my first ever movie review.<p>"White Palace" is as close to a perfect movie as one can get.  How can it not be?  I never was into the drama/love story genre; but this movie has the right balance between the lead characters, the story and the setting, the supporting cast, the music, and with the awesome partnership of James Spader and Susan Sarandon, got me stuck watching it and making me love Susan Sarandon more than before!<p>I've always liked Susan Sarandon more than James Spader in the movies they have separately made; but now that I've seen him in this move, I just had to find out more of his other movies.  Now, I'm looking forward to getting my hands on "Storyville" and "Dream Lover".<p>Great job, Director Luis Mandoki!  Now let me check your other work...
 | product/productId: 0792841506 | review/userId: A29QA79VLQGHY6 | review/summary: Down and dirty | review/text: There's a great yarn behind this 1967 macho touchstone. The extras on Warner's special edition focus on director Robert Aldrich, who was set on making a mainstream anti-war movie. A solid 2006 documentary tells how Aldrich carpet-bombed the heroic conventions of American war films. Actor Donald Sutherland recalls: "He wanted to make a war film that was ugly. That was brutal and vicious. And nobody was good." The Dirty Dozen's massacre of trapped Nazi officers and their wives served as commentary on Vietnam and its atrocities, with gasoline standing in for napalm.<br /><br />Good video quality (it appears to be the blown-up-to-70mm crop) and a high-energy 5.1 audio mix.<br /><br />Check out the fun Swinging Sixties docu about Lee Marvin and the cast hanging out in London during production breaks. Despite disclaimers that the DD story had anything to do with the real-life Filthy 13 unit, there is a detailed docu about that warpainted wild bunch. Only the gung ho will make it to disc 2 for the 1985 TV movie "The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission."

They focus one the isolation of the individual and the fears that one creates. By our own willingness through self-fortitude we face those fears. And perhaps the very nature of those fears was not what we had made them out to be. The performances by Agnes Moorehead, Gladys Cooper and Robert Redford make these episodes very tangible for the emotional response of the viewer. Very effective and highly recommended viewing.
 | product/productId: 0792842731 | review/userId: A3A6HRZI3HGKTQ | review/summary: Not a bad action flick, but a sub-par Bond film | review/text: Call the Bond films what you like...&quot;repetitive&quot; and &quot;formulaic&quot; are some adjectives that non-Bond fans (and even Bond fans) often bring up in discussing the series.  And as a Bond fanatic, I  fully recognize that these films are formulaic...and, frankly, wouldn't  want them to be any other way.  I believe that much of the series' enduring  charm stems from the predictability and familiarity of certain  elements.<p>Sadly, these elements are not up to snuff in Tomorrow Never  Dies.  The acting is simply weak throughout, something symptomatic of a  poor script.  How else can you explain the waste of the talents of Jonathan  Pryce? Roger Ebert once said that a Bond film is only as good as its  villain - something made abundantly clear by this entry in the Bond canon.  Pryce's character - Elliot Carver, a sort of Rupert Murdochesque media  baron - is simply not over the top or megalomaniacal enough.  He's just  like...well, Rupert Murdoch.  Carver's henchman, Herr Stamper (who looks  eerily like Dolph Lundgren's Drago in Rocky IV) is a cartoonish bad guy  with cartoonish dialogue.  The Bond girl (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't ever coo a  proper &quot;Oh, James.&quot;  Even Teri Hatcher's presence is squandered.  And why? Quite simply, a bad script (which reportedly had to be re-written  at the last minute...and it shows).<p>Also, the directing is shoddy.  There  are some slow-motion action shots interspersed throughout the movie that  have no place in a Bond film, but rather the latest Seagal or Van Damme  film (not that there's anything wrong with Seagal or Van Damme flicks, of  course...).<p>Strangely enough, I could foresee all of this coming when I  first saw the film: if you look at the end of the opening credits, Roger  Spottiswoode's name stays up on the screen for a good ten seconds, even  after the titles fade out...something never before done; a hubris  unbecoming of a Bond director.  There are some missing shots throughout,  and the picture itself isn't as good-looking as its predecessor.<p>All is  not lost, however.  The action (especially in the opening scene and in the  Hamburg car park) is still fun to watch.  Plus, Desmond Llewelyn pops by  with the usual gadgets and reassuring presence (which we'll sadly miss come  the next Bond film).<p>This isn't a bad film, and is actually a half-decent  action film.  But as a Bond film, it is sub-par -- something that would be  made up for in abundance by the next Bond film (&quot;The World is Not  Enough&quot;, soon to be released on video, which, along with  &quot;Goldeneye&quot;, is much more highly recommended for new[er] Bond  fans).

This movie isn't about the action.  It's about Charlie Sheen's struggle on the inside.  He gets to know one of his CO's only for him to get shot be the other CO, who is a crazed maniac.  This movie is about the horrors of war and what it does to people, how it changes people.  It's not about guys shooting the guts out of their enemies for pleasure.
 | product/productId: 5552390644 | review/userId: A7OBFVHNJGI2A | review/summary: Excellent DVD edition of a so-so film | review/text: _Jonah_ was my introduction to the "Veggietales" universe. Alas, it's not one of the little legumes' best efforts. Bible stories tend to be very short, and children's adaptations of these stories are best when they keep to an hour or less (as most "Veggietales" videos do).<p>At 83 minutes, this retelling of "Jonah and the Whale" is thoroughly padded. The pacing is sporadic at best, with lots of puerile sermonizing, and most adults will be bored to tears. The target audience of children may also be confused at the strange ending -- though, to be fair, even the Veggies admit they don't much like it. (As someone who takes a more sympathetic view of Jonah, I think Veggietales is unfair to the most successful Biblical prophet on record, but their interpretation is very much in keeping with the mainstream of contemporary evangelical-Christian interpretations.)<p>The film itself is best suited to children ages 4-8 from evangelical households. If you're not Christian, you'll find _Jonah_ deeply offensive -- one musical number (in gospel style!) features enough crosses to line the Appian Way. (As Robin Williams remarked in _The Birdcage_, "Are we crucifying someone tonight?")<p>The DVD's numerous extras run the gamut from kid-friendly karaoke to extensive technical commentaries. It's an excellent edition of a so-so film.<p>Warning to parents: This film contains many ethnic stereotypes.

 | product/productId: 6301106482 | review/userId: A17FLA8HQOFVIG | review/summary: The story of Texas itself in this star-studded family saga | review/text: The 1956 film is aptly named; everything about it is huge. Three years in the making, and a full 202 minutes long, it's the sweeping story of a Texas family that starts in the 1920s.  Elizabeth Taylor is the young bride from East who, after a whirlwind romance with Rock Hudson, comes to his huge 595-acre Texas ranch.  Here, she finds his unwelcoming sister, prejudice against the Mexican servants, and a condescending attitude to her as a woman.  James Dean is here too, a sullen ranch hand who yearns for her as well as wealth.  She's feisty though, as well as beautiful, and the rational center of the film, which spans a quarter of a century, as she and Rock Hudson quarrel, make up and raise their three children.  Texas changes too.  James Dean, the ranch hand, is the first to discover oil, and all of their lives change dramatically then.  After a while all the land in the area is gushing oil wells where cattle used to roam.<p>During the course of film the makeup changes to show the cast aging, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was only 23 at the time, is shown as a mature woman.  Dennis Hopper plays her grown son and Carol Baker her daughter. There's even a small part for Sal Mineo, who plays a grown up Mexican-American boy.  By then the story is a family saga with the son choosing to be a doctor and the daughter finding the older James Dean an attractive man.  This is the stuff of soap opera, which I usually don't like.  But somehow, I was completely captivated by this film, which shows how everyone's character develops through the years.<p>I was impressed with the quality of all of the actors, including Mercedes McCambridge, who has a small role as the sister.  Sometimes I forget how talented Elizabeth Taylor is as an actress and even Rock Hudson, who is known for his rather stilted performances, was able to show some real feelings.  James Dean, however, stood out above all the rest.  The scenes he had with Elizabeth Taylor in which he showed his awkward vulnerability were ripe with nuance.  It demanded mastery of his craft.  His performance was indeed outstanding.<p>However, it is almost half a century since the film was produced.  I now know what Elizabeth Taylor really looks like as a mature woman.  I have to smile at her gray-haired persona in the film, in which she remained slim and elegant.  I can't help thinking about Rock Hudson's super masculine image as he dukes it out in a diner when his Mexican-American daughter-in-law is refused service.  And I'm saddened to think of poor James Dean, who died tragically in a car accident at the age of 23 shortly after the film was made.  His movie image of aging alcoholic millionaire is the only hint we have of what he might have looked like if he lived.  The film even brought out thoughts of our own President Bush, himself a product of a Texas background and his own mixed Mexican-American family.<p>The video consisted of two reels, and included about an hour's worth of features in addition to the more than three hours of the film itself.  I stayed up late into the night to watch it all, including a short documentary about the small town in Texas in which part of the film was made, an interview with Dimitri Tiomkin who wrote the music for the film, an interview with the son of the director, George Stevens, and a long telecast of opening night both in Hollywood and New York with Jayne Meadows interviewing different stars as they entered the theater.  Although the film itself was in color, all of these features were in black and white and brought back memories of live television shows, bouffant hairdos and mink stoles.<p>I never saw &quot;Giant&quot; when it first came out.  Videos and DVDs were years away in the future and, in those days, if you didn't catch a film in the theaters when it first was released, that was that.  I'm so glad that this film was so easily available all these years later because I totally enjoyed the experience of spending a evening watching it.  I was able to sit back, relax, and return to a time, place and cinematic point of view that doesn't exist anymore.  The world is changed now.  And so have I.  But I absolutely loved this film. Highly recommended.

Since it's based upon the book (which I have read) it is for the most part true to the book, but there is some things I have noticed that are not cleared up and some people are confused on, yes it really doesn't have much to do with the Pet Sematary, but this whole story was written based upon King's own experience, in the introduction of my book he tells about how this story came to be. He had moved to Maine to work at the university, and they lived along side a road just as bad as in the book, his son actually did almost make it into the road where a big 18 wheeler was well on its way but luckily for him he says either his son fell before he made it to the road or he pulled him back just in time but fear makes you forget these things. So there is where gage comes into play, as for church, kings daughters cat died while they were there and he heard strange popping in the garage where he found his daughter stomping on the clear bubble packing screaming "he was my cat, he was mine, why did god take him he was mine, god could have his own, not mine" and king thought this to be the purest reaction to death. Anger. A pet cemetery really existed near their house and it was written "pet sematary" so this is where that also came in and how it became the title. King then took these events and pushed it to the worst scenarios and the "what if" factor and actually didn't publish it for 3 years after writing it because he was so disturbed by what he had wrote. As for how they were coming back, it is explained to be the wendigo who soured the ground, and if you're touched by the wendigo you begin to have a cannibalistic trait, explaining why church had a new found love of ripping animals apart, and why gage insisted on biting on necks and eating his mothers face. So i hope this cleared things up for everyone and can help you appreciate just how great of a movie and book this really is. It's insane, and commendable for king to push himself this far when it has to do with his own family, that makes you connect with it so much more.

It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility.<br /><br />And clearly I was not the only one impressed by this movie. It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.<br /><br />Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.

The other films are the medieval parody of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", the riotous "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" and the compilation of sketches "And Now for Something Completely Different". Of these, "Brian" is possibly the most famous film.<br /><br />The plot, inasmuch as it really matters in a comedy, deals with a young man born in a stable in Roman-occupied Palestine. No, not that famous young man who went on to found a major world religion, another young man, albeit one who inadvertently finds himself with a stream of zealous followers.<br /><br />A plot like this will obviously risk being called blasphemous and sacriligeous, but the Python crew manage to tread just on the right side of religious objections while still taking part in one of the funniest films ever made.<br /><br />There are of course a number of very famous scenes here. One of these is the dialogue among the locals overhearing the Sermon on the Mount and misinterpreting one of the beatitudes as "blessed are the cheesemakers", a scene very closely followed by a visit to a stoning. Here, John Cleese plays an official in classic style, charging a man with blasphemy (although his only crime was to say that his wife's dinner was "fit for Jehovah"). The request that no stones be thrown "even if anyone says 'Jehovah'" is one of the many catchphrases known to comedy fans the world over.<br /><br />In due course, young Brian (Graham Chapman) falls in with a band of rebels trying to overthrow the Roman state. At least, they would be doing that if they could stop their political squabbles.  In order to escape from certain death, Brian must masquerade as a prophet - of whom, true to history, there are many. Despite not being a particularly talented prophet, he is ascribed a number of miracles and eventually crucified.<br /><br />The film is, however, more successful as a result of the Python comedy - which can be better appreciated when this is viewed as a series of vaguely linked sketches. The debates among the rebels are a real highlight, as are Brian's attempts at prophethood and the significance given to mundane events by his band of followers.<br /><br />This is also the film in which several iconic scenes take place. One of these is the shout of Brian's mother to an assembled multitude that "He's not the messiah! He's a very naughty boy", followed soon after by Brian's call that "You are all individuals", to which the crowd responds in one voice "Yes, we are all individuals" (Cleese then pipes up "I'm not!"). Another is the scene in which the words "Romans go home" is being written in Latin on a wall. A centurion catches the vandal and forces him to conjugate the sentence correctly, much in the style of Latin teachers of the day.<br /><br />The next classic moment is Pilate and his speech impediment of not being able to pronounce the letter R ("Welease Weginald") and his claim that the names "Biggus Dickus" and "Incontinentia Buttox" are quite normal ones for his friends to have.<br /><br />Of course, as most of the world knows, this is also the film in which - at the end of the crucifixion scene - the condemned men sing the immortal "Always Look On the Bright Side of Life".<br /><br />Is it blasphemous? Speaking as a history student, I find it hard to say that it is. For all the unique events surrounding the birth of Christianity, claims of prophethood and eventual crucifixion were quite common at the time in question.<br /><br />Is it as great as history records? Probably not. By all means it is an incredibly funny film, but it seems to have dated slightly more than the rest of the Python oevre. The Latin-teacher scene (Romane ite domum) is a prime example, as the humour can only really be appreciated with knowledge that this is the way dead languages were taught - and that dead languages were very popular at the time the film was made.<br /><br />That said, "Life of Brian" is definitely a landmark in British comedy and would not be out of place in anyone's DVD collection.

The movie progresses quickly and rarely lingers, and comes off as one of the more believable close encounter movies around.  It's more than just a sci-fi film, it's a look at what happens when a  person can't explain what's driving them forward.  Highly recommended  except for one flaw; the director's cut removes a few minutes of brilliant  footage of a man going nuts to stick on some fancy special effects.
 | product/productId: 1604860170 | review/userId: A3MHMWK3JGN52F | review/summary: The Bolivarian revolution from all sides | review/text: The Venezuelan revolution is unique and full of contradictions. Even among those of the left, the figure of Hugo Chavez has caused great debate and division as he has certainly achieved great things, stood up to all of the powers of the global North, and transformed Venezuela...while at the same time he is part of the military and he has also tried to draw ever more power into his own hands. What I loved most about this documentary is that it is a frank and sometimes critical look at Venezuela, combining a broad and unique set of voices ranging from street vendors to community organizers to cooperative workers to academics. It manages to show a panorama of Venezuela's realities that achieves both width and depth at the same time, and never enters the realm of propaganda.<br /><br />It starts with broad enough information and background to be interesting to those who really know nothing about what has been happening there, yet also gains good depth through the interviews, making it enlightening for those who have been following events there closely.  Its effectiveness comes from its broad picture view of what has happened there on a national level, moving down to an extensive look at what is actually happening on the grassroots level. The multiple interviews of Venezuelans doing the hard of work of building alternative community and economic organizations are both candid and inspiring, making it particularly useful for people doing community work here in the US.<br /><br />On a final note it has subtitles in both Spanish and English so it is accessible in both languages, and as someone who is bilingual, I'd also like to say they really did an amazing job with the translations.

 | product/productId: 6301661745 | review/userId: A2198FZZMTJ38H | review/summary: An absolute stunner! One of the great sci-fi films! | review/text: People often ask me what my favorite movies are, which is never an easy question, but what remains even harder is listening to their pondering one of my answers with the question, &quot;Why is that one of them?&quot; Such is the case with &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; the 1968 classic science fiction film that has become a milestone in moviemaking. As I am not an avid fan of the genre, it bewilders people to learn that such a film ranks so highly in my opinion. But this is no ordinary science fiction film we're talking about, either. <p>Despite numerous sequels, a short-lived television series, and a modern reenvisioning of the film that might as well be a different movie all its own, the first and most appealing &quot;Apes&quot; film captures everything that is great about film in a single two hours of pure, unmitigated brilliance. From its psychedelic opening sequence to the final, hard-hitting shot, the movie works a silent spell on its audience that remains with the mind long after the experience has ended. It's nuanced plot provokes thought and consideration, and its smart sense of reversal is simply stunning. <p>The movie is based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, beginning with astronaut Colonel George Taylor making preparations for a sleep that, to him and the other three members of his crew, will last a few mere hours as their space ship travels thousands of light years into space, leaving Earth behind for a new planet on which to begin a new civilization. They soon find themselves on a barren, seemingly uninhabited planet, with the sole female of the crew deceased and three days supply of food and water for the remaining three astronauts. <p>Their trek across the desert terrain leads them to an oasis, flowing with fresh water and inhabited by humans, who are seized and taken as prisoners by the dominant apes that rule the planet. Taylor is also captured, taken to their colony, where he discovers that apes have taken on the role of Earthly humans, and humans are the lesser species. He makes impressions on all who encounter him, from Dr Zira (Kim Hunter), the animal researcher who is perplexed by his intelligence and speech capabilities, to the high council, whose ignorance causes them extreme fear in the face of the new arrival. <p>But rather than just provide simple answers to the question of where Taylor has landed, the film examines more thought-provoking issues, from the harsh treatment and prejudice of the humans by the apes, to the ways in which science is viewed by the apes, whose government and belief system are much like that of humans on Earth. Dr. Zira and her fiance, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), provide arguments for the existence of Taylor on their planet that also carry small clues as to what the movie is building up to, while also enforcing the film's theme of ignorance in the assembly's unwillingness to accept their theories.  <p>As we try to decipher the many twists and clues provided us by the characters, the movie is at work diverting us from the big picture, keeping us at bay. Even still, it is the film's final shot that remains the most effective, and sells the film on everything its plot argues. It's a revelation that makes clear all that we have been pondering during the course of the story, but it is also a cold look at the possible future that lies ahead if man continues on his current path. This warning is no less meaningful today as it was then, and it proves that &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is one of the most effective science fictions films ever made. <p>The casting department scored big points in acquiring Charlton Heston for the lead role. As Taylor, Heston is the actor we have come to know and love, hitting us with a performance full of power and true emotion, something many actors of today fail to possess. Heston successfully conveys the wide variety of emotions needed to pull his character off. <p>It must also be said that this is one of the most visually arresting films ever made. The opening shots just before the craft crashes into the sea are complex and mind-blowing, setting up the tone of unease that will palpitate throughout the film. The setting fits the material entirely, evoking the harshness of the planet with its parched desert and dry, arid appearance. <p>To call &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; a strictly science fiction film is unjust, as there is more to its story. There is a meaningful lesson to be learned from its unfolding events, which carry with them universal truths that will remain recognizable by the future generations who see it. Its production and cast are remarkable, but what remains its most effective aspect is its ability to mystify the audience, leading us to believe one thing until we realize its something entirely different.

So far that alone, the disc should be well worth the $10 + tax that I paid.  Audio however is nothing great;  labeled as 2.0 DTS-HD (not 5.1 DTS Master Audio or similar).

 | product/productId: 0767802527 | review/userId: A1Q2NR1JVHSBXK | review/summary: A tragic love story | review/text: I find it strange the movie is titled "Leon" because it really revolves around the life of Mathilda.<br /><br />I bought this movie just because I caught a glimpse of the editted version and was intrigued by their relationship. It was clear that Leon, a 40 something year old man, and Mathilda, a 12 year old girl, were falling in love with one another despite the disparity in age.<br /><br />I think Mathilda was a fascinating character, mostly because of her boldness at such a young age. Clearly she is aware of her sexuality, both the character and the actress. And that is what made her acting so convincing.<br /><br />It's obvious that Mathilda is not sexually attracted to Leon, nor is Leon sexually attracted to her. This makes these scenes non-pediophile in nature. However Mathilda desperately wants to express her love for Leon and thinks that sex is the best way to do it. She's not uncomfortable with the idea of sex because it's about love, not sex. Leon refuses for fear of experiencing that level of intimacy again, and he is uncomfortable with the idea of having sex with a 12 year old girl.<br /><br />In one scene, Mathilda states matter of factly how having sex with him will be a good thing. Leon then begins to explain with great emotion what happened to the first and last woman he loved, and why he chooses to live alone.<br /><br />At this point, and in the end of the movie, their feelings and love are expressed. It's the circumstances of their life, the violence and the drama, and the unique people that they are, that causes them to care so deeeply for one another. I only wished the movie ended on a happy note rather than tragedy, but this also gives the drama of their story realism- life likewise is often a harsh reality. Tragedy also makes the story much more memorable, and forces you to appreciate it more.<br /><br />I'm definitely glad I got the uncut version, but I would reccomend as others did to get the 2 disc edition as you get more extras with it (like interviews).<br /><br />There seems to be some controversy over the scenes that portrayed Natalie Portman's character in a sexy way, but this only emphasized her love for Leon. Because clearly it was not primarly sexual desire, but came from a deep sense of love (caring, appreciation, respect). She didn't try to kiss him or seduce him in earnest, but merely to show what she was willing to do for him because she loved him so much. Which I suspect Leon recognized and also why he refused her.

 | product/productId: 6300214834 | review/userId: AJRFZ0VZ0LD26 | review/summary: Private detective's nightmare | review/text: Mr. Caul is an expert on surveillance techniques.  One if his clients hires him to tape conversations between a young couple that spends their lunch break in the park close to their office building.  His equipment and technique is impeccable and he manages to capture conversation and pictures they have.  Mr. Caul has a skeleton in a closet too.  One of his previous engagements ended tragically and that causes him to be overly careful about his current assignment as well as his own personal life.<br /><br />Sure enough, his suspicions about the job materialize.  However, the outcome is not what he expected it to be.  His already fragile psyche is pushed to its limits and he is on the path that is irreversible.<br /><br />This movie is a powerful psychological drama about the modern world, technology we are surrounded by every day, how that technology affects us as a human beings and what it means to play God by listening in to other people's conversations.  After all, any conversation can be taken out of context.  And sometimes it ends up being lethal for anyone involved.  Powerful performance by Gene Heckman.

 | product/productId: 0800130928 | review/userId: A3UDYY6L2NH3JS | review/summary: The film finds a new legitimacy in this new electoral year | review/text: 1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

The book that goes with the DVD is basically the same as the Adult Level One Book, so if you have not purchased the Level One book already, get this instead.<br /><br />It was very helpful to see and hear how the lessons should be played and the teacher also gives some very good tips that you would not find in just the book.

Does it matter whether trials against members of the military are handled by way of court-martials, or before a country's ordinary courts?<br /><br />I first saw "A Few Good Men" as an in-flight movie, and after the first couple of scenes I thought that for once they'd really picked the right kind of flick:  A bit cliched (yet another idle, unengaged lawyer being dragged into vigorously pursuing a case against his will), but good actors, a good director and a promising storyline.<br /><br />Then the movie cut from the introductory scenes in Washington, D.C. to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Jack Nicholson (Colonel Nathan Jessup) inquired:  "Who the f**k is PFC William T. Santiago?"<br /><br />And suddenly I was all eyes and ears.<br /><br />Director Rob Reiner and Nicholson's costars describe on the movie's DVD how from the first time Nicholson spoke this (his very first) line in rehearsal he had everybody's attention; and the overall bar for a good performance immediately rose to new heights.  Based on my own reaction, I believe them sight unseen.  Or actually, not really "unseen," as the result of Nicholson's influence is there for everybody to watch:  Never mind that he doesn't actually have all that much screen time, his intensity as an actor and the personality of his character, Colonel Jessup, dominate this movie more than anything else; far beyond the now-famous final showdown with Tom Cruise's Lieutenant Kaffee.  Nobody could have brought more power to the role of Jessup than Nicholson, no other actor made him a more complex figure, and nobody delivered his final monologue so as to force you to think about the issues he (and this film) addresses; and that despite all the movie's cliches:  The reluctant lawyer turning out a courtroom genius (as lead counsel in a murder trial, barely a year out of law school and without *any* prior trial experience, no less), the son fighting to rid himself of a deceased superstar-father's overbearing shadow, and the "redneck" background of the victim's superior officer Lieutenant Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland, who nevertheless milks the role for all it's worth).<br /><br />Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who adapted his own play, reportedly based the story's premise - the attempted cover-up of a death resulting from an illegal pseudo-disciplinary action - on a real-life case that his sister, a lawyer, had come across in the JAG Corps.  (Although even if I take his assertion at face value that assigning the matter to a junior lawyer without trial experience was part of the cover-up, I still don't believe the real case continued the way it does here.  But be that as it may.)  Worse, the victim is a marine serving at "Gitmo," the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, where *any* kind of tension assumes an entirely different dimension than in virtually any other location.  In come Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and co-counsels Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack) and Lt.Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), assigned to defend the two marines held responsible for Santiago's death; L.Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and  PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall), who claim to have acted on Kendrick's orders to subject Santiago to a "code red," an act of humiliating peer-punishment, after Santiago had gone outside the chain of command to rat on a fellow marine (none other than Dawson), attempting to obtain a transfer out of "Gitmo."  But while Kendrick sternly denies having given any such order and prosecuting attorney Captain Ross (Kevin Bacon) is ready to have the defendants' entire company swear that Kendrick actually ordered them to leave Santiago alone, Kaffee and Co. believe their clients' story - which ultimately leads them to Jessup himself, as it is unthinkable that the event should have occurred without his knowledge or even specific direction.<br /><br />By the time of this movie's production, Tom Cruise had made the part of the shallow youngster suddenly propelled into manhood one of his trademark characters (see, e.g., "The Color of Money," "Top Gun" and "Rain Man"); nevertheless, his considerable skill (mostly) elevates Kaffee's part above cardboard level.  Demi Moore gives one of her strongest-ever performances as Commander Galloway, who would love to be lead counsel herself in accordance with her rank's entitlements, but overcomes her disappointment to push Kaffee to a top-notch performance instead.  Kevin Pollack's, Kevin Bacon's and J.T. Walsh's (Jessup's deputy Lt.Col. Markinson's) performances are straight-laced enough to easily be overlooked, but they're fine throughout and absolutely crucial foils for Kaffee, Galloway and Jessup; and so, vis-a-vis Dawson, is James Marshall's shy, scared Downey, who is clearly in way over his head.  The movie's greatest surprise, however, is Wolfgang Bodison, who, although otherwise involved with the production, had never acted before being drafted by Rob Reiner solely on the basis of his physical appearance, which matched Dawson's better than any established actor's; and who gives a stunning performance as the young Lance Corporal who will rather be convicted of murder than take an unhonorable plea bargain, yet comes to understand his actions' full complexity upon hearing the jury's verdict.<br /><br />"Unit - corps - God - country" is the code of honor according to which, Dawson tells Kaffee, the marines at "Gitmo" live their lives; and Colonel Jessup declares that under his command orders are followed "or people die," and words like "honor," "code" and "loyalty" to him are the backbone of a life spent defending freedom.  Proud words for sure:  But for the "code red," but for the trespass over that invisible line between a legal and an immoral, illegal order they might well be justified.  That line, however, exists, and is drawn even in a non-public court-martial.  I'd like to believe that insofar at least, this movie gets it completely right.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009L1TA">Basic</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXGV">Rules of Engagement</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792164962">The Firm</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FGBW0">The Border</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840024747">Guantanamo: 'Honor Bound to Defend Freedom'</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGTQ7K">The Caine Mutiny (Collector's Edition)</a>
 | product/productId: 0792164946 | review/userId: AUHG8KSHI529U | review/summary: While a romance on the truth, still very exciting and moving | review/text: Let us stipulate that this movie is romance on the book, "Braveheart" (by Randall Wallace), which is itself a romance on the very real Scotts hero, William Wallace.  In those two steps of fictionalization, loosely based on history, more than a few facts can float off into the ether.  You can easily search the web and find any number of websites that will list all the errors in the movie.  There was even a show in the History Channel discussing the reality of Wallace's life versus the movie and why certain choices were made, such as fighting the battle of Stirling Bridge on a field in the movie rather than on a bridge as it was in real life.  Never mind the fact of the real life ages of the characters making most of the interactions in the movie absolutely impossible.<br /><br />And while all comparisons of fact and fiction are interesting, two facts remain:  the movie made the name of William Wallace more popularly known than he had been in centuries, and it is a very effective and exciting movie.  Believe me, I understand the pain of those who truly love Wallace and feel that their hero has been disgraced and cheated.  It is almost always true that facts suffer greatly when compressed into the constraints of a movie and those that know the facts understand how they add to the meaning and purpose of their hero.  They resent any compromise or cheapening for simple expediency or catering to popular appetites.  This is all fair and true.  However, this movie is a fiction of a fiction of based on real figures.  In a way, it is the opposite of the old "Dragnet" show.  The events are fiction; only the names have been kept.<br /><br />Leaving history aside, the film is exciting, stirs feelings of patriotism, and allows good to triumph over evil even at death.  In the movie, Wallace has to overcome everything, including the loss of family and betrayal by those who should have been his friends.  He has real fears of what he has to face at the end and it is his faith that provides the foundation of his courage.  That kind of nobility inspires us and stirs our own resolve.<br /><br />The battle scenes, while historically inaccurate to a great degree, are amazing to behold.  There is a lot of gore and violence in these medieval battles.  It is that gore and a couple of gratuitous uses of the medieval f-word that give the movie an R rating more than the brief scene at the grove with Wallace and his new wife.<br /><br />While not one of my all time favorite films, it is very much worth viewing and contemplating.

RE: APOCALYPSE begins right after the end of RESIDENT EVIL, somehow the T-virus has escaped infecting the city, Alice has escaped but has been genetically altered into a killing machine now she must stop the horrors loose in the city. The movie is a lot busier than the first with an entire city destroyed by the virus. Alice teams up with Jill a member of S.T.A.R.S a specially trained squad of some sort. The plot consists of finding a missing girl  escaping from mutated monsters and escaping the city unfortunatly they also have bigger problems literally, namely THE NEMESIS, the reporter from the previous movie has been mutated into a killing machine programmed to kill the S.T.A.R.S and Alice. The Characters once again seem to bond into a family and it actually made me care who lived or died. The end of the movie was left open for yet another sequel hopefully it will be the last part of a trilogy. EP

You had Blade Runner in the 80's and The Fifth Element in the 90's. Both are Sci-Fi epics that are an acquired taste and get better the more times you watch them. This film introduced the world to Milla Jovovich and it's still one of my favorite performances from her. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker (oh so annoying, but it works here) round out the excellent cast and create memorable characters. The unique visuals and music still hold up extremely well and the "blue diva alien" song still never fails to impress. This was one of my first Blu-rays (very good picture quality) and probably gets more play than the others.

One drawback: Billy Wilder's and Charles  Brackett's umpteenth witty collaboration is allowed to go on too long by  director Howard Hawks, who has been more energetic in his comedy efforts  previously. Still, miles ahead of today's 125-minute comedies!

It's a bit strange seeing a young Christopher Walken, but he does a good job with the role.  The film plays out like a slow motion car wreck as Walken's character descends into madness, or does he?<br /><br />With a "gift" for seeing, and possibly changing the future, the viewer is left to wonder what they'd do given the same "gift".  The story unwinds a bit slowly, but that's to take in and understand the circumstances and give one time to ponder the unraveling situation.<br /><br />Good for a viewing.

 | product/productId: 6302241693 | review/userId: A34IBXM7E8CPWE | review/summary: I'm Going to Godzilla-Land!! | review/text: So the basis of this film is that aliens once again want to take over the Earth, and this time, they plan on using Ghidorah and Gigan for their nefarious purposes.....oh, and they are also building a kick-ass amusement park with a Godzilla tower!! How the amusement park factors into the whole taking over the Earth thing doesn't make a lot of sense until you find out that the Godzilla tower has a very cool laser in it's mouth, one the could kill Godzilla...(you know..as long as Godzilla only stands in front of the tower and doesn't approach it from the side or rear???).<br /><br />Yes, this is one of the goofier entries in the Godzilla series. The whole idea of aliens using monsters to take over the Earth had been done several times by Toho, and in more imaginitive ways. These aliens don't seem that bright, and the re-use of several action shots from previous films kind of shows that this thing was made on a shoe-string budget. To top it off, or heroes in this film are a comic book artist, his controlling wife...and a fat Japanese hippie!<br /><br />Godzilla and Anguirus do have a scene or two where they "talk" to each other. I don't think it would have bothered me except that they basically say nothing! If you are going to go the route of having the monsters communicate, at least have them say more than "big trouble up ahead" and "come on"...<br /><br />For all of it's faults though, I give "Godzilla vs. Gigan" a pass, and say you should add it to your collection simply because of the introduction of Gigan. This is one viscous monster, with hooks for hands, one big stabbing talon on each foot, and a buzz-saw on his belly, he slices and dices his way through Godzilla and Anguirus during the epic final battle. King Ghidorah is always fun to watch, so any film featured the three headed dragon is worth a place on your shelf as well. While this may be aimed at a younger crowd, it's not a kiddie film in the way "All Monsters Attack" is, though kids will like it. Simply leave your reasoning ability at the door, pop in the DVD and enjoy some classic Toho monsters slugging it out.
 | product/productId: 0790732491 | review/userId: A2TBIU2VW9DE4U | review/summary: The Worst Film I've Ever Seen | review/text: This is the worst film I've ever seen.  Watching this film is like watching someone burning millions of dollars in cash before your very eyes.  In other words, it's a loud, boisterous spectacle that is also  depressing.  It's so horrible that I almost cried.  Seeing a once respectable film franchise being mercilously slaughtered is a grim experience.  While watching this film, one feels that the director had a deep, dark, personal contempt for the Batman franchise, and that this film was part of his "master plan" to destroy it.<br /><br />Most of this film's cast has gone on to do bigger and better things.  This is the one miracle to emerge from this disaster; one would think that this film would be career suicide for any accomplished actor.  Oddly enough, the cast survived to do other movies.  Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />And now there is a two disc special edition!  How did such a thing happen?

 | product/productId: 0790731509 | review/userId: A1H8NFQIKKD756 | review/summary: Stone Cold Classic | review/text: As many reviewers have noted, "Cool Hand Luke" is an absolute milestone of anti-establishment cinema.  The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on-location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.  The reviewers who claim that the "moral" of this film is that people should not assert individuality in prison clearly have no understanding of the word "allegory," because in a symbolic sense, the exact point of the film is that the existence of the human spirit depends upon asserting individuality in the face of brutal, institutionally-backed conformity.  As a systematic, hard-headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure--which is why he's photographed via the iconography of crucifixion after the egg-eating contest, for example--and reviewers who take his character to task for rebelling against the system completely miss the point and go a long way toward demonstrating the very problem the movie works to expose.

 | product/productId: 5559375241 | review/userId: A3OEECMCM2T4KQ | review/summary: Manipulating Our Fears | review/text: One's expectations have a lot to do with our level of enjoyment for many things. Having viewed all of Shyamalan's work from the "The Sixth Sense' to "Signs", admittedly, my expectations were quite high in anticipation of "The Village".<br /><br />Shyamalan's growing reputation as the master of the "twist ending", is well deserved. He's a good storyteller. So, when walking into the theatre to view his latest, though my expectation were high, I really didn't know what to expect, but I knew it would be original. After speaking with many people and reading reviews about the film, we either really liked it or really hated it. Personally, this film had me mesmerized from start to finish, and in the end, did not disappoint. It is dangerous to expect too much of anything, because more often than not, what we expect never pans out. I believe those that hated the film had, in some cases, preconceived notions about its content. "The Village" is not a "monster" movie, but a story about love, courage and predominately, fear. Fear is the picture's central theme; how fear can be used to control people, and the dire results that can come with exploiting fear to manipulate our hearts and minds.<br /><br />Shyamalan is not only the master of the twist ending but he's a genius at creating the eerie atmosphere that in turn creates deep suspense. He certainly had the audience jumping in their seats from time to time. In some ways, he used his talent as a storyteller in this film to manipulate the audience with fear to then reinforce the film's theme, that fear can be used to manipulate us in life. This was very clever, almost too clever.<br /><br />It is impossible to write about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't yet seen the film. Let me just say that it is highly original. The performances from all the cast are first rate, particularly the character, Ivy, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. William Hurt also did a fine job.<br /><br />Good advice would be to see this film without too many expectations, erase from your minds any preconceived notions, and simply sit back and view it for what it is. Although not Shymalan's best work, in my opinion, it is one of his better efforts.
 | product/productId: 0792841484 | review/userId: A1FG91CM8221X1 | review/summary: Before Tarantino, there was Kubrick. | review/text: Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" is a delightfully taut, hard-edged, thrilling film noir with superb performances by a whole rogues' gallery of B-movie bad guys (and gals). The non-linear script--written by Kubrick with dialogue by Jim Thompson--was an obvious influence on Quentin Tarantino, particularly in "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown." Kubrick and Thompson give us a panoramic point-by-point view of a heist gone wrong, as well as three-dimensional portraits of some truly fascinating, hard-boiled losers. The only irritating note is the obtrusive, Dragnet-like voiceover narration--and, if I remember correctly, the studio forced it on Kubrick. (No wonder he became such a fanatic about having final control over his films.)<br /><br />Because of the theme of "The Killing" and the presence of Sterling Hayden in the lead, more than one viewer will compare "The Killing" with the similarly plotted "Asphalt Jungle." But as fine as John Huston's film is, Kubrick's is better. Hayden was never better as the tough, fatalistic ringleader of the heist, and several other performers here reached career bests: Elisha Cook as a pathetic little race-track betting window teller who wants to be a big man in the eyes of his wife; Marie Windsor as Cook's wife, as trashy and two-timing a floozy as ever oozed through a film noir; and uber-creepy Timothy Carey as the sharpshooter Hayden hires to create a diversion while the heist goes forward. At a swift 83 minutes, "The Killing" ranks as one of the great film noirs. It's my favorite of all of Kubrick's films except "Dr. Strangelove" (once again starring Hayden, of course!).

It had none of the scope his previous films had.<br />Second...<br />The movie spends too much time on the "bad guys" a total waste of time, the lesbo chick is just too over the top and completely unbelievable, with terrible potty mouth dialogue.<br />Third...<br />Retreading the old, Harry is still making illegal searches and still hopes they will throw the book at the criminal, simply because Harry says so.<br />Fourth...<br />The action scenes are ludicrous, the victim of Harry's search, an early twenties guy who's murder case is thrown out(due to Ditty Harry) and then decides to attack Harry on the road with molotov cocktails(even though he should be thanking Harry), harry kills them all.<br />Fifth...<br />Harry needs a vaca, so off to San Paulo for the rest of the movie. This means NO car chases, no interesting vistas and no foot chases.<br />Dirty Harry without San Fran is like a tofu hotdog with no bun.<br />Sixth...<br />The farting dog. Hey what does Dirty Harry need? A farting bull dog who pisses on everything prompting a response of..."swell" from Harry.<br />Its his new indicator of displeasure with less syllables than his previous catch all phrase "marvelous".<br />Seven...<br />The overall low quality cast and pacing was more like a TV movie.<br />Eight...<br /> The movie was just no fun at all its pure torture with no pay off.<br />Harry is just an accomplice in the revenge scheme of Locke, and the final killing where Harry mumbles (inaudible to the bad guy) "make my day" like some mantra is stupid beyond belief.<br />Nine...<br /> Cinematography is bad, dark with a complete disregard for composition and lack of sweep.<br />10...<br /> In this one Harry doesn't even identify himself as a police officer when asking peripheral bad guys questions. Preferring instead to insult them until they throw down, then Harry beats the hell out of them.<br />11...<br />  The "intersecting paths" meeting between Locke biking and Clint jogging his dog in the movie is lame.<br />Both are heading right towards each other on a long straight path along the shoreline, yet when Locke nears them she just falls of her bike rather than stop or go around Harry's swell farting dog.<br />12...<br />harry drinking Budweiser? c'mon at least he had a Michelob or Guinness in the other movies.<br />The Deadpool while not great was like a Sierra Nevada in comparison to the horse piss that is Sudden Impact.

 | product/productId: 0792837797 | review/userId: A3KBI4GO38PKQ1 | review/summary: Powerful parable | review/text: Anyone wanting to understand why citizens of countries like Iraq and Afghanistan attack their "liberators" needs to view this film. It does not justify its heroes, it explains them, and shows them "warts-&-all". The picture is brilliant from that perspective: if you're born-again or atheist, neo-con or Green, survivalist prophet or organic guru, mensch or yogini you can find a character in this film through whose eyes you can gain an inner perspective on what we in the USA -- of almost all political stripes, ethnicities, beliefs, ages, genders, persuasions -- might do if outside governments sent troops to conquer our country by armed violence which slayed combatants and innocent civilian men, women and children alike; and after the conquest, those foreign troops remained as occupiers, using imprisonment, torture and further murderous violence (including killing more innocent civilians) to impose and maintain control of our lives, politics and destiny.<br /><br />I challenge anyone to watch this film and find no parallels between what the insurgents -- er, "terroists" -- are doing in Iraq or Aghanistan now, and what the Wolverine's act out in this movie. There are other, older, movies that deal with similar themes, primarily per a WWII perspective. But even 20+ years later this film feels remarkably current, and direct as a punch to the solar plexus. Pair it with "Rambo III", which enshrines the political support of the USA that the Taliban and Al Quaeda enjoyed while they were spawning, for an evening of chilling retrospection and visceral enlightenment.

Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable).<br /><br />Bear in mind that there's little call for redigitizing such public domain minor works as this. HIGH VOLTAGE is best for collectors of the earliest talkies and for fans of Carole Lombard and Hopalong Cassidy creator William Boyd. They are EXCELLENT in this story, BTW as is the rest of the small cast, despite occasionally cornball dialogue.<br /><br />Interested viewers feel the biting cold these stranded people endure and bear along with them the deprivation of things we normally take for granted, like nourishment and physical ease. Those who dismiss this movie lightly should consider its place in history. All-talking pictures hadn't been around for a year when this was released in June of 1929 yet "High Voltage" is an engrossing photoplay with a most satisfactory conclusion.

Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci almost guarantees that it'll be great - add an Oscar-worthy performance from Sharon Stone and you have one of the greatest mob flicks of all time.

Interesting story, great acting and some classic lines - what more can you ask for?
 | product/productId: 0783226845 | review/userId: A1J93EGDYK0IWA | review/summary: Great character acting with a moving and powerful plot | review/text: This is a great movie and Al Pacino certainly does a great job of playing a difficult and enigmatic character.  I particularly like the ending where the Colonel brings forward his best qualities that are laying dormant for much of the movie.  If you are familiar with Enneagram types, this character is an Enneagram Eight.  This type is known to have a gruff exterior, a fear of vulnerability, but a very big heart.<br /><br />There is a lot of drama, funny moments and a plot that will hold anyone's attention.  The movies makes the point of the importance of good character and points out a lot of the hypocricy of contemporary society in both direct and indirect ways.  Also, this movie is interesting because of the struggles with uncertainty, ambiguity, the problems of being human and the problems inherent in living up to high ideals.<br /><br />The young companion of the Colonel also does a great job in this movie.  As the plot develops, a significant and moving relationship forms.  This is a nice inspirational, humorous and entertaining movie.  How can you really miss with Al Pacino?!

 | product/productId: 6302479401 | review/userId: A3NVNNLSVEVZ99 | review/summary: Ahead of its time | review/text: "Under Suspicion" is a truly remarkable film that addresses a taboo issue. The film is well head of its time, which will ensure it remains classic for years to come.<br /><br />Based on John Wainwright's 1960's book "Brainwash" and the 1980's French film "Garde a Vue" or Police Custody. The book title gives you a hint of the plot which neither film title does. Whether the American movie is loyal to the French film or British book I do not know, but the European influences are readily apparent.<br /><br />One can expect superb performances from Hackman and Freeman, but one should also expect that such actors can choose superlative plots. Under Suspicion is a complex plot which explains why so many do not see it. If anything it is too complex.<br /><br />One of the advantages of film over print is that a film can use multiple Points of View far more readily that print.<br /><br />The first point of view is that of the junior detective, ably acted by Thomas Jane. Horrified by the crime - rape and murder of two children, blinded by prejudice, the detective jumps to the gut belief a rich dirty old man must have done it. The detective reflects the mob mentality.<br /><br />The second point of view is that of the senior detective (Freeman). Both detective and suspect (Hackman) are of similar age, know each other and have similar marital problem, so a battle of wills develops between them. This is common plot device used to encourage the audience to identify with the characters but in this film it detracts from and confuses the plot.<br /><br />The film opens with a plot device intended to create tension. The suspect is on his way to public speaking engagement when called in for questioning. This is implausible and again detracts from the plot. The device becomes effective when the senior detective's boss puts pressure on the detective to release the suspect to fulfil the engagement.<br /><br />The evidence against the suspect (Hackman) is circumstantial. However the suspect's explanation of the events is confused and self-incriminating, which serves to convince the Senior Detective of his guilt. Hence the title of the French film - Police Custody.<br /><br />At one stage the plot `thickens' leading the audience to suspect the male suspect is guilty of under-age sex, but his wife is guilty of murder, driven by jealousy. This plot line is made implausible by the beauty and young age of the character playing the wife, Monica Bellucci.<br /><br />The subtext of "Under Suspicion" is classically French. Many Hollywood films seek to capture the beauty of French film when seeks to get behind the headline "Lock your daughters away - Paedophile on the rampage, raping and murdering little girls." French film often deals sensitively with the cause of such issues. The problem is not Hollywood' failure to portray the issues but the audience demand for likes of Scream 1, 2 and 3.<br /><br />The subplot, the theme of the film, is played out by the suspect (Hackman) and to a lesser extent by the wife (Bellucci). The subplot is brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. Whether he is guilty or not is irrelevant by the end of the film. The suspect is coerced into believing he is guilty. Hence the book title "Brainwash".<br /><br />The Point of View of the wife, told more than acted, reveals the sub-plot and the theme of the film. She first met the suspect when she was twelve and he was a 30 year old adult. His hobby was photography. She delighted in the attention of his camera lens. As she grows she accepts his patronage to attend university and finding men of her own age wanting, she returns to seek him sexually. Passionately in love, they become the celebrities of their town, until one day she sees him paying the same photographic attention to her niece. Blinded by jealousy she believes his intention can only be sexual. In her jealous rage she freezes him out. His sexual deprivation, his love of photography, merely serve to provide motivation to the circumstantial evidence. If his wife, the one person he loves, can believe he is guilty, then he must be. Hence he confesses to something he had not done.<br /><br />"Under Suspicion" is a gripping and frightening film. Its shows how innocent people can be made to feel guilty and be found guilty by social prejudice, ignorance and misunderstanding. More frightening is the potential sequel to the story. That a person made to feel guilty, but found not guilty, can and probably will proceed to commit the crime with impunity. Both themes have been portrayed in other books and films. I do not know of a film which portrays both themes with the subject of paedophilia. Lolita is probably the closest one can get. Under Suspicion fires a warning shot across society's bows. It warns that the more society is blinded by moral indignation, which is happening with paedophilia, the worse problem will get and innocent people will be destroyed by the prejudices of the lynch mob.<br /><br />All film functions to reinforce or question society's values and attitudes. Society, even in 2009, is not yet ready for the questions raised by "Under Suspicion". Brilliantly acted, directed and edited, `Under Suspicion' is undermined by the commercial demands on contemporary cinema. But it has got to be 5* for its courage alone.
 | product/productId: 5554818293 | review/userId: A152C8GYY25HAH | review/summary: Coy, prudish recycling of 'Flashdance' | review/text: Many who watch Coyote Ugly will find themselves feeling the story is very familiar. There are some good reasons for that. One is that Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the most successful producers of all time, insists that his movies be done by the numbers. As a result, while most people in the business are envious of his financial success, you'll rarely find him grabbing awards on Oscar night. Mr. Bruckheimer is also a firm believer in recycling. Sixteen years ago, he produced a big hit called Flashdance, in which a determined and beautiful girl worked as a dancer in a fancy bar until she was able to become a dancer in the theater. In Coyote Ugly a girl so similar as to be a clone works as a dancer and bartender in a huge bar until she can make it as a songwriter. In both movies, the girl is mentored into stardom by a handsome young man because, I suppose, we are still saddled by the odd notion that, not only can a woman not make it without a man, she has to sleep with him, too. I am certain that Mr. Bruckheimer would claim that the guy is still around to give a movie dramatic appeal, but I would argue that it says that the more things change, the more they remain the same in Hollywood. <p>Violet Sanford [Piper Perabo] moves to New York City from New Jersey. Dad [John Goodman] doesn't approve, but this being a by the numbers movie, we all know from the start that he'll come around. In New York, Violet takes cassettes of her songs around to the big music companies. They virtually throw her out on her ear. One night a tape winds up in the hands of a charming cook named Kevin [Adam Garcia], and he realizes what we know even though we haven't yet heard the songs: Violet is a super talented writer. Meanwhile, she lands a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly. In this establishment premium liquor is sold in shot glasses. That's all they sell. When the girls aren't too busy pouring shots or spraying customers who ask for water in the face with the same, they get up on the bar and dance. The crowd goes wild. This is the kind of place that only exists in a movie. <p>Coyote Ugly has in its favor a very high energy level and a very pretty cast. It has a great many familiar songs, mostly from the 80s, in it, thus assuring brisk soundtrack sales. Its original songs, unfortunately, are unlikely to still be being played in the 2020s. Perabo is a charming and talented actress, and better parts are bound to come her way. For her, this movie is merely a stepping stone.<p>Bruckheimer is a pro at sniffing out the winds of change, and he knew that the summer of 2000 would be one in which the 'PG-13' rating would rule. This was not due to Hollywood's sudden taking of the moral high ground. It was due to saber rattling coming from Washington and to the fact that Hollywood's core audience is now so young that many of its member aren't supposed to be able to buy tickets to 'R' rated fare. The result of Bruckehiemer's having copped out is that Coyote Ugly, which by it's very nature should have been 'R' rated, comes off as coy and prudish. There are many times when we want to say 'for shame' to producers whose use of gratuituous sex and violence earns their movies an 'R' rating. Still, there are times when it is somehow dishonest NOT to go the restricted route, and Coyote Ugly is a good example.

From the beginning to the end, El Cid bequeaths a universal example of patriotism and leadership during hard times.  Anytime  I feel the world is falling apart, I pull out El Cid and find inspiration.  This story did begin as the actual Spanish legend of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar  and even though Hollywood has romanced it just a little, it still lives on.  The ending is the most dramatic commitment to inspire the troops that I  have ever seen.  We need more heroes like him.  This is a story of a man  who made great personal sacrifice to unite his country at a time when unity  seemed impossible due to religious and political differences throughout all  of what is now known as Spain.  I show it to all my Spanish III students  and they really love the ending!  It is also good for World Lit classes as  a Spanish legend during the Medieval period.

Just picked it up at Meijer for 10 bucks, thought that it was a great deal.  Even though the info on the back of the box says that it's from 2007 and is formatted for widescreen TVs, it's still two-sided (you have to flip it over halfway for the other half of the movie) and it's literally NOT made for widescreen televisions.  Of course since it was opened I couldn't return it unless I exchanged it for the exact same thing, which also happens to Warner Home Video's policy according to their website.  No thanks, I'm good.<br /><br />If you want it to actually look NORMAL on your widescreen TV, you have to spend twice as much and get the special edition...great job there Warner...
 | product/productId: 6300256073 | review/userId: A1YXU284YM7EDN | review/summary: The REAL Triumph of the Will | review/text: This and "A Matter of Life and Death" are Powell & Presberger's masterpieces, before they descended into the schmalz of "The Red Shoes". The tale of the essentially decent British and German gentlemen, played by Roger Livesey and Anton Walbrook respectively, rapidly becoming dinosaurs in the changing Europe between the Boer War and the Blitz, yet clinging to their values despite being kicked in the face by the brutalisation of Germany and by the consequent brutalisation of a Britain attempting to survive against barbarism. Their friendship begins from the mutual respect engendered by a duel fought reluctantly for the honour of their respective traditions at the time of the Boer War. During convalescence they vie for the hand of Deborah Kerr, turning up in the first of 3 roles. Livesey's shyness leaves Walbrook holding the field. Nearly 20 years pass until they meet again, at a POW camp in Britain. Livesey's essential naivete rides roughshod over the wartime enmity, but Walbrook's response is ambivalent, and the reunion is short-lived and bittersweet. Livesey marries Deborah Kerr's reincarnation as a nurse, because of a resemlance to his first love. A further 20 years pass. Livesey, widowed, is asked to act as sponsor for Walbrook, now exiled from Germany, also widowed and estranged from his Nazi children. Together they come to terms with their sidelining in a world of younger men with few of the old values. Deborah Kerr turns up for the third time as Livesey's driver as he moves from army officer to Home Guard organiser,refusing to be pushed out of the fight. In appearance Livesey's character assumes the appearaqnce of David Low's cartoon Colonel Blimp, but underneath he is more rounded; decent,generous to and loyal to friends, slow to denegrate his foes and totally patriotic, but finally nobody's fool. John Laurie appears in a delicious cameo as Livesey's batman/manservant, crusty but loyal. His boss may occasionally infuriate and perlex, but Laurie recognises the basic decency, as, finally, all do who come into contact with him. It may be propaganda, but it is still magnificent.

There are complex character studies that flow naturally as the torment escalates.<br /><br />This is almost perfect spy thriller.  Since it was made right after World War II, the propaganda slant is noted.

The whole issue has not been completed so we will see if they replace the one I can't use with one I can and if they refund the return shipping costs.  They said that they shipped the item "as ordered".  Why would I want a DVD that can't be played on USA players?  If I had wanted one that could be played overseas I would have asked for one, but in fact there isn't even a way to request such a product on the Amazon ordering site, that I could see, so of course never indicated such a thing.<br />So just be warned.

 | product/productId: 0790731037 | review/userId: A34PUCLNFN62D3 | review/summary: THE WILD BUNCH.- A Mexican footnote. | review/text: Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' is a masterpiece western. Not the best ever made, but close. So don't think I don't like this movie because I love it. However, since Mexicans are its villains, perhaps you'd be interested to read an opinion from this side of the border.<p>The Mexico of 'The Wild Bunch' looks more like a metaphor than a real place. It is both Heaven and Hell; the theatre where the bunch will find Death but also Redemption. Accordingly, every Mexican depicted in the picture is either a saint or a monster (no middle ground here, except for the Mexican member of the Bunch, who is aptly named &quot;Angel&quot;, although a fallen one). This serves the story splendidly, for it's meant to be an epic ballad and not a travelogue, but it does jolt the Mexican viewer because the &quot;good Mexico&quot; is portrayed so idyllic it's unreal, while the &quot;bad Mexico&quot; is very, very accurate; in fact, no American movie has captured the look, sound, feel, texture and carnage of the Mexican Revolution as this one has (even if the grandiose final scene, where the Bunch kills hundreds of heavily armed soldiers all by themselves and none of the four falls down even when riddled by bullets, defies all logic!). Perhaps that's why it was banned in Mexico back when it was released in 1969.<p>Funny, for it was filmed in Mexico as well. The Texas bordertown you see at the begining of the story is actually Parras, Coahuila, and many of its citizens acted as extras in the movie: white ones as &quot;Texans&quot;, brown ones as -what else?- Mexicans! Don Ra&uacute;l Madero, brother of Francisco I. Madero, the man who started the Mexican Revolution, appears ...as a Texan! Even the two German officers are Mexican! So, as you can see, we Mexicans come in all shapes, sizes and colors, and hardly fit these two tiresome &quot;noble peasant&quot;-&quot;greaser bandito&quot; stereotypes American movies seem so comfortable with! I hope some day Hollywood realizes this and &quot;walk the extra mile&quot; to portray us for what we are: a very complex and diverse society. Neither saints, nor monsters, and certainly not mere bowling pins!<p>P.S.: Many great Mexican directors, all personal friends of Peckinpah, appear in the film. Emilio &quot;Indio&quot; Fern&aacute;ndez (Mapache) and Chano Urueta (Angel's grandfather) were the best of our cinema's Golden Age. Fernando Wagner (German officer) was also a competent theatre director, and Alfonso Arau (Herrera) is best known for his international hit 'Like Water for Chocolate'. Jorge Russek (Zamorra) was an outstanding photographer for National Geographic, and Sonia Amelio (Teresa) is a world-aclaimmed dancer (she was even awarded with an &quot;Order of Lenin&quot; back in the Soviet Union). And just for the record, the word &quot;Mapache&quot; (&quot;racoon&quot;) stands for &quot;coward thief&quot;. No Mexican general, no matter how corrupt, would use, I believe, such a nickname! And since Mapache is &quot;a killer working for Huerta&quot;, the action takes place in 1913, not 1916 (Huerta was ousted in early 1914).

I've seen it through 3 times now, and I still don't understand what's so great about this movie.

It is one that needs to be viewed as a &quot;thoughtful comedy&quot; to be appreciated.  It deals with some heavy duty material, but is done so in more of a &quot;what if&quot; manner.  This is not to be taken as the absolute truth.  Anyone who thinks that this is an indication of how things are needs their head examined.<p>Acting wise, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, and Jay Mewes shine.  Even Ben Affleck is quite entertaining.  In all honestly, Linda Fiorentino is the only disappointment.  Everyone else pretty much NAILS their roll.  <p>And of course, the commentaries are great.

 | product/productId: 6300213803 | review/userId: A2RKI7RPP5CJMG | review/summary: Space Opera Supreme | review/text: Take a classic television series with a dedicated fanbase, insert one of its most popular villains and toss a major motion picture budget at it and what do you get:  "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan."<br /><br />Perhaps the closest film in the "Star Trek" catalogue to the original televison series, "Khan" finds Kirk as the admiral in charge of assessing a green crew on routine training maneuvers.  They happen to be aboard his old ship, the Enterprise, and the crew includes most of his key past crewmates.  In another part of the galaxy, former crewman Chekov and his new captain are investigating a planet that may be used for Project Genesis, a device that could literally give new life to a planet.  What Chekov and his captain actually find is a man hungry for revenge:  Khan.<br /><br />Having been exiled years ago and blaming Kirk for the death of his wife, Khan puts a plan into action to bring Kirk back into his clutches in order to get revenge.<br /><br />Falling for Khan's trickery and with an inexperienced crew in tow, Kirk takes the Enterprise to Regula One, home of Project Genesis.  He hopes to find out who used his name in order to get their hands on Genesis.  Instead, he finds an ex-wife, an estranged son and one of his greatest enemies waiting to strike.  What happens next is, simply put, a wonderful blend of drama, suspense and humor as Kirk and Khan battle each other to the death.<br /><br />For a film released in 1982, "Khan" has excellent special effects.  Granted, there are a few miscues, but the story more than makes up for them.  Director Nicholas Meyer paces the film with perfection, utilizing the musical score and the individual performances of the players in order to build tension on the screen.  He guides the games between Kirk and Khan with precision.  All of the original crew do superb jobs, but I must point out that William Shatner gives his best performance ever.  Ricardo Montalban's over-the-top performance as Khan makes this film worthy of five stars.  Kirstie Alley makes her first big screen appearance and adds quite a bit of sex appeal to the film as Lt. Saavik.  That's a tough job for a person playing an emotionless Vulcan to do.<br /><br />As for the DVD, this two disc set makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.  The digital transfer of the film is excellent.  It's one of the best transfers of a film including the original cast.  Only "Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country" has a crisper looking transfer.  The sound is also very good.  There aren't as many special features included with this set when compared to the other films in this series, but they are some of the best extras you'll find.  Highlights include original interviews with DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban as well as new interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, Meyer and executive producer Harve Bennett.  There's also an interesting segment involving "Star Trek" authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox.<br /><br />Fans of "Star Trek" have most likely viewed this film already.  For those folks who haven't or for people who aren't fans of science fiction, I highly recommend "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan" for its drama, wonderful suspense and overall story.  For fans of military films, the calculated tactics of both Kirk and Khan should keep them interested.  These are just a few of the reasons that have made this film one of the most popular of the "Star Trek" pictures.

 | product/productId: 6301978536 | review/userId: A1M9DQDGE07Q0U | review/summary: BITTERSWEET TEAR-JERKER IN GLORIOUS TRANSFER | review/text: One of the all time great four hanky tearjerkers, "Random Harvest" (1942) is a bittersweet tale of love and sacrifice, set against that mythical backdrop of jolly ol' Britain that never was. It stars Ronald Colman as Charles Rainier, a war veteran who is suffering from amnesia. Paula Ridgway (Greer Garson) is the unfortunate dance-hall hostess who falls in love and marries Charles - renamed John Smith. But true love never runs a straight course and John and Paula's brief chance at divine happiness is overturned when a car accident jogs John's memory. He returns to the life he once knew, oblivious that his new and fragile world with Paula ever existed.<br /><br />Colman's gentlemanly congeniality, as always, astounds with genuine canter and frank grace and maturity - qualities soarly lacking from the leading men of today's cinema. Garson is charming; blowing in as a summer's breeze and just as passionate, divine and charming as Colman. Director Mervyn LeRoy modulates each plot point and circumstance with subtle panache and quiet rectitude for his subject matter. There's never a point at which the melodrama becomes cheap, exploitive or overwrought. Ah, but the years may pass and memories fade, but "Random Harvest" has proven to be that rarest of eternal cinematic treasures - genuine  and outstanding in every way.<br /><br />Warner Home Video delivers a marvelous DVD transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with fine tonality and attention to fine detail. The picture is generally sharp and pleasing on the eyes. Blacks are very rich, deep and solid. Whites are on the whole clean. Occasionally one will detect a note of edge enhancement and the odd age related artifact, but these are bare quibbling on an otherwise flawless presentation. The audio is mono and very nicely balanced. A hint of background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes, but again, for a film element that is pushing 70 plus years, there's really nothing to complain about here.  Two vintage short subjects, a trailer gallery and audio only broadcast of the film round out the extras. A very nicely put together trip down memory lane from the good people over at Warner Brothers. Top marks and highly recommended!

Heck, I even like Fantasia.<br /><br />Even though I like the book, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," more than I like the Disney film, the film is still magnificent.  The animation is nothing short of gorgeous, as is the case with all of Disney's animation, and the continuity is solid.  The characters are instantly likeable, and I just love the songs.  I would recommend this movie to anybody.  It's a classic.
 | product/productId: 0790741814 | review/userId: A3BAE79NXFDXGV | review/summary: From a good film to an excellent one. | review/text: The Big Red One-Restored Cut turns an okay film into a classic!  Sam Fuller's W.W.II film is finally the epic it was meant to be.  The extra forty minutes of footage and other minute tinkering makes The Big Red One one of the best films about World War II ever made.  Fuller brings his own experinces along with Lee Marvin's and uses them both to it's fullest creative extent.  This disc is well worth the price.  Two discs (One with the film and the other is chocked full of extras).  The soundtrack has been remastered and pumped up as well.  You can't go wrong with this extended version.<br /><br />Far from perfect but it's an awesome film filled with hard-boiled grit and smooth direction.  Sam Fuller knew how to film battle scenes.  The extra footage gives this film a "hard" R-rating.  Grab a copy of this and Beach Red, another classic World War II film.  Forgot Saving Private Ryan, watch a war film made by someone who was there!  The picture quality is clean and pristine and so is the sound.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

 | product/productId: 0783223161 | review/userId: A1NOLEWY3EBW01 | review/summary: The best suspense movie ever made. | review/text: It took me such a long time to write a review for this masterpiece because there's just so much to say about it and a movie this good deserves a good review. This movie is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, along with Rear Window, Vertigo, and all the others. I'd have to say this is my favorite Hitch movie, next to Rear Window.<br />  First, I'll start with the performances, which are beyond Oscar-worthy. Janet Leigh should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress back in 1960, and Anthony Perkins wasn't even nominated for Best Actor, which I think is a huge mistake. I think Norman Bates is one of the best movie villains of all time. And all the other performances (Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam), are amazing, too. The film opens with amazing credits by none other than Saul Bass, into the opening scene, and scene after scene is filled with sharp dialouge, great characters, and a very eerie feeling out of all the dreary black and white, and finally halfway through the film, after the amazing parlor scene, there's the infamous "shower scene", with the shrieking violins, composed by Bernard Herrman, the camera cuts (77 different camera angles/took a week to film, and the scene is only about a minute!), and the pure terror of the scene. I really envy the people who saw it back in 1960 not knowing what was going to happen.<br />  The film is basically two acts. The first act ends an hour into the movie, after the ten minute clean up scene, with no dialouge, right after the shower scene. The remaining 49 minutes build up more suspense until the crazy ending, which literally sent a chill down my spine. In fact, it's my favorite scene, next to the shower scene, of course. And for anyone who hasn't seen the film, I won't tell you the rest of the ending, but it's just so creepy and disturbing. It holds you right until "The End"<br />  I haven't really said anything about this film that hasn't been said, but I just need to say this is the best suspense film of all time. The music, the acting, the black-and-white, the disturbing story (based on the Robert Bloch book), the infamous Bates Motel, and of course the shower scene. This is one of my favorite films of all time, from the best director of all time.<br />  The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely wonderful. It comes in a hard plastic case that snaps open like a book. The Disc 1 comes with the film, and some special features, including a vintage newsreel of the release of Psycho, the shower scene with and without music, lobby cards, production photos and notes, the original 6 1/2 minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel, and some re-release trailers. The Disc 2 comes with The Making of Psycho, an amazing 1 1/2 hour documentary that tells all about how Psycho was made, a half-hour documentary about different directors talking about Hitchcock's influence (how it influenced thier own movies, along with showing clips of Hitchcock's own movies, which I really liked). It has different directors talking like William Friedkin, Eli Roth, Martin Scorsece, etc. I love watching that special feature over and over. The third feature is a fifteen minute excerpt of the legendary 12-hour Hitchcock/Truffaut interview. They both talk about Psycho, while it shows clips from the movie. The fourth and final feature is an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled "Lamb to the Slaughter", which is one of my favorite episodes. I love that show!<br />  Altogether, "Psycho" is one of the greatest films of all time, and this is the greatest release of this movie (other than Blu-Ray). If you haven't seen or bought this movie, do it NOW!
 | product/productId: 0792840852 | review/userId: A2EIKI4ZYV8VU7 | review/summary: The Best Musical Comedy Ever Produced! | review/text: I fell in love with this film when I was seven years old; I watched it on a B&amp;W television on &quot;The Early Show&quot; in NY (circa 1957 or 1958).  I didn't know who any of the stars were - it didn't matter.  It was magic to me.  From the Hollywood opening (dignity, always dignity), the romp of the elocution lessons (Moses supposes his toes are roses!), and the trial and mostly error of trying to record the sound (&quot;I can't make love to a BUSH!&quot;) when the gorgeous leading lady has a voice that rivals nails on a blackboard, all the way to the grown man dancing in the rain and the final rising curtain - pure magic. In glorious black and white - at the time, I didn't even know it HAD colour!  I decided then and there, this was my absolute all-time favourite movie.  (One of the highlights of my adult life was seeing this wonder on a full, big screen at a revival in the 1970s.) I have seen many films since then; I have reviewed them for friends &amp; family, written reviews for a monthly entertainment publication.  I have an extensive collection of my own (VHS &amp; DVD).  I know a lot more about films and production values now.<p>&quot;Singin'in the Rain&quot; remains my all-time favourite film.  (No surprise, this.)  It's not just another one of &quot;those MGM musicals.&quot;  It was released in 1952. Dated stuff?  Not a bit. Unlike the marvelous &quot;An American in Paris,&quot; which was done as a contemporary film to its time, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is a  period film, and it's based in fact.<p>This film (which started out to be a western for Howard Keel) takes a fond and loving look at the birthpains of the sound film (the &quot;talkies).  Set in 1927, with authentic equipment from MGM's own history (Debbie Reynolds drives Andy Hardy's old jalopy, the microphones are real), it details the frantic efforts to get on the sound bandwagon - no one was completely sure of the new technology.  What makes the plot classic is the basis in fact.  Many silent stars had totally unacceptable voices or speech (too nasal, unintelligible foreign accents, too high, too low, etc.) for sound production.  The songs used were true to the period.<p>Then we have the performers.  Jean Hagen was nominated for an Academy Award for her role of Lina Lamont.  The character (whose voice you don't hear for the first 10+ minutes of the film, although she's on-screen) is a one-of-a-kind.  [Side note: the voice dubbing Lina's line is actually Hagen's normal voice, not that of Debbie Reynold's Kathy Selden.]  Reynolds does an admirable job - it couldn't have been easy keeping up with her two male co-stars.  It's still a joy to see Donald O'Connor's &quot;Make 'em Laugh,&quot; and wonderful to see Gene Kelly teamed with a good male partner for &quot;Fit as a Fiddle&quot; and &quot;Moses&quot;.  Gene Kelly is, and always shall be, the best and this was done at his peak.<p>Of course, for anyone who has been living in the back of a cave under a rock (or too young to appreciate it), the title number is a delight.  It looks like one continuous take, it is so smooth.  This was not the first appearance of the song, but it's the one we all remember. The sheer exuberance of Kelly's performance carries us right along with him.  <p>The extras with this set are valued items for anyone like me who is interested in the backstory of the era and this film in particular.  And don't fuss for a widescreen version.  This is the way it was.  And now it always will be.

This film must have been a fantastic escape from the Great Depression. The timeless score, graceful perfection of their dances, the witty banter and the production design all offer a glimpse of the incredibly deep pool of talent the country had to draw from in the 1930s. No special effects, no auto-tune for the singing, just a terrific cast of seasoned performers doing wonderful work.

I loved this movie when I first saw it and through the years Ive always remembered the rats of NIMH.  My 10 year old son was assigned a book to read this summer for school and the name is Mrs. Frisby and the rats of NIMH.  When I bought it for him I wasn't paying too much attention to it and assumed it was from the same author but a different book.  As he has been telling me what the story is about I excitedly told him that I had seen the movie when I was little and that I loved it.  Ofcourse his reaction was "There's a Movie?" "I don't have to read it.".  To which I laughed and promised him we would watch it when he finished.  I am thrilled to find it here and be able to share this with my son, especially since he likes the book so much.

Strooooong greeeeean teeeeeaa. | review/text: Somewhere along the way, the writers of KITE lost all remaining sense of direction, got boozed up and decided to go with whatever they had in the morning. What started with a script of Luc Besson's 'La Femme Nikita' ended up being one of the most uninspired and dumbest pieces of crap ever made. Halfway through, you can't help but think this conversation took place:<p>--<p>Writer: "Uh, sir, to tell you the truth, I have no idea where I'm going with the script, and the plot so far has no redeeming value whatsoever."<p>Boss: "Add sex scenes."<p>Writer: "Maybe if I add some character development and--"<p>Boss: "SEX SCENES!!"<p>--<p>Sawa is just a regular cute Japanese teenage girl. (sounds original already, doesn't it?) The thing is, if it seems like she's coming on to you, she's probably getting ready to shoot you in the head with an exploding bullet. Don't feel bad, though, it's nothing personal. She and a male assasin named Oburi-- who English voice actors pronounce "Ovary" for some inexplicable reason (something I don't believe is a coincidence... I thought there was something strange about that guy)-- systematically kill people who their employer decides are evil.<p>The voice acting is laughable at times in the English dub ("I like teeeeaaaa. Stroooooong greeeeeeeen teeeeeeaaa."). Monotony and raspy voices is the game here, apperantly. The script is not awe-inspiring, either ("Impressive, my cute little assassin. Too bad you're going to die ugly."). In fact, just about everything in this movie in subpar.<p>The ending is the epitome of all copped-out (not to mention inane) movie endings. Just why the basketball girl does what she does at the end has actually caused me to lose sleep over trying to figure it out. I thought I might sound like an idiot if I didn't decipher it before posting a review, but I've come to the conclusion that even the writers had no idea... what they were doing.

 | product/productId: 0783114222 | review/userId: A11KPB9VZP8LIG | review/summary: Aspect Ratio Debate -  My Take | review/text: First, let me say that I own both the 1998 full screen Collector's Edition and the 2005 widescreen Signature Edition.  Many reviewers are debating whether the 2005 edition is true widescreen (1.85:1) or a cropped version of the full-screen (1.33:1) picture.  Well, I compared the two versions I have, and I can tell you that the answer is:  IT IS BOTH.<br /><br />In the filmed sequences, there is more of the picture visible in the 2005 edition.  This definitely means that the show was originally filmed in widescreen format.  However, the entire series is a composite of filmed sequences, actual archive footage/pictures, and computerized special effects.  Since the archival footage and special effects were not filmed in widescreen, they had to be cropped to widescreen format.  So, in the 2005 edition, anytime you see original archival footage or SPFX it is going to a cropped image.  The rest will be true widescreen.  In the 2005 edition, the cropping is very noticeable during opening title sequence of each episode.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help out potential buyers.  In my opinion the cropping is not a big enough reason not to by this DVD.  This is an excellent mini-series, and should be seen by everyone.

Lord, is 'You Can't Take It With You' corny.<br />And dated.<p>I wont argue that many of this Capra classic's<br />sensibilities haven't slipped from vogue.  But kids,<br />this is an old movie starring a lot of famous old<br />actors that you might want to check out.  It's about<br />a family of eccentrics living together in a single<br />house and behaving like a truckload of Looney Tunes<br />characters let out on loan from the Warner Brothers<br />studios.  They don't fret money. They don't fret<br />mores. They don't fret the authorities. They don't<br />give a hoot about appearances.  In fact, they don't<br />do much of anything, other than what they feel like<br />doing, which is usually nothing that'll help anyone,<br />not even themselves.<p>I'm willing to admit that even as a fable it's not a<br />very practical, pragmatic, or mature message to impart<br />on a child.  But impart it on yours anyway.  Just about<br />everything else kids meet in this world will teach them<br />to be pragmatic, sensible, even calculating, quick<br />enough.<p>I think every ten-year old kid should see this movie<br />(and 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington', and 'Meet John<br />Doe').  Parents, wrestle those young'uns away from<br />blowing things up on their video console, or from<br />watching things get blown up on television, and force<br />them to watch this flick.  If they're too jaded by age<br />ten, then show it to 'em when they're nine, or eight.<br />Heck, beam it at 'em 'in utero'.<p>The collective message of Frank Capra's films is<br />frequently misidentified by his critics as a belief that<br />human beings are all inherently good, and will do good<br />if given the chance.  Such critics like to point out how<br />dangerously naive that belief is (and they're right),<br />but Capra's message is more subtle than that: that any<br />community--a town, a country, or a family--can and<br />should be based around an unwavering doctrine of<br />unconditional compassion.  Once you have that, you're<br />protected from this oh-so pragmatic, sensible, and<br />calculating world.<p>SIDE NOTE: Jean Arthur was the greatest celluloid<br />combination of knockout sex appeal, smarts, and comic<br />ability ever, and young girls looking for better role<br />models than the narcissistic twits personified on film<br />these days by the likes of Cameron Diaz and Julie Roberts<br />should check her out in this and other Capra classics.
 | product/productId: 1566052580 | review/userId: A1YIWDKM1292L4 | review/summary: "Don't be afraid of Lobo. He's as gentle as a kitten." | review/text: Bela Lugosi, Jr. once said in an interview that his father always gave his best to a performance, no matter how bad the movie itself was. This is true in the case of "Bride of the Monster." Lugosi's performance is the highlight of the film; despite his obviously frail health, he does a good job as Dr. Eric Vornoff, employing Dracula-like hand motions, extreme close-ups of his glaring eyes, and evil little chuckles.<p>As for the rest of the film...well, it's not as bad as I would have expcted an Ed Wood film to be. Sure, the octopus is so fake it's ridiculous, and the dreaded atomic machine is a doctor's examining table with a salad bowl for your head, but it's not a total shambles of a production to the extent than "Plan 9" would be. <p>The movie probably looks better than it did originally, due to a very good transfer to DVD; the picture is great for an old movie which was at the time cheaply made. The sound, however, could have been a little better; I had turn my TV volume almost all the way up in order to hear Loretta King speak and make out what Lugosi was saying, with his thick accent.<p>If you're a fan of the movie "Ed Wood," it's worth checking out to see the real "Bride" portrayed in that film. I would also recommend it to loyal Lugosi fans who want to see Bela in his final speaking role. He said he wanted to work until the end, and although "Bride" is by no stretch a worthy farewell to such a fine actor, you will still enjoy Lugosi's performance.

Sunny is a cocktail waitress that always seems to be on intimate terms with Murphy.  Anything that can usually does go wrong for her.  When she sees a man with a gun, and thwarts his plans, it is revealed later that an assassination was going to take place.  Sunny has saved the Emir, and in the process takes a bullet in the tush.  She is turned into a media darling overnight.  A grateful government gives her a job in the protocol office, but that is only what appears to be on the surface.  The Emir has decided that he wants Sunny for his next wife, and thus a deal is struck.  When Sunny discovers what her government has done on her behalf, Washington will never be the same.  I enjoyed Goldie and Chris Sarandon.  They have chemistry, and great comedic timing.

I love it, and bought the DVD the day it came out in that format.  I love DVD because you can skip to a favourite scene, but I realized when I started watching this  movie that I love the whole thing.  I think every single line in the movie  is funny.  NO EXCEPTIONS. Every single line. The bank robbery scene is pure  genius.  This is a credit to the Coens.  The amazing part is that they have  found a way to make such a funny movie without being offensive or obscene.  An extremely intelligent comedy that only plays dumb.

I didn't like the Sixth Sense and never saw Signs.  Yet, this movie just was disappointing.  You totally know the ending if you pay attention at the begining (I won't spoil it for those who want to see it).  Beware it was not scary.<br /><br />The previews had hyped this movie up so much that it looked amazing! I am suprised that I stayed the whole time. Yet-it wasn't.  Even looking at the previews currently showing it looks like something I would love to see--but I don't care to watch it again.<br /><br />It is your call on this movie--some people who I talked to loved it; others were like me and thought it was a joke.  It is one you will have to decipher on your own.

 | product/productId: 0792164946 | review/userId: A190MNWZC1PN8O | review/summary: Absolutely Incredible | review/text: Braveheart is simply the best movie ever made. Mel Gibson directed the movie of a lifetime. The beautiful love story and Wallace's fight out of revenge transform this epic into an eternal classic. <p>Gibson tried to mirror the success of Braveheart with last summer's release of The Patriot. And don't get me wrong, I loved that movie as well. However, there was one critical error in the production of that movie: the abscence of a score by James Horner. Horner's score from Braveheart creates feelings of despair, rage, and suprise that go beyond the story. The call for &quot;freedom&quot; at the end of the movie is incredibly intensified by the background music and there hasn't been a single time that I didn't get chills while watching that scene. <p>If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not waste one more second. Go to your closest video store and rent the DVD. Watch it on a big screen tv and grab some popcorn, a Coke, and a box of Kleenex. I wish I could go back and watch this movie for a first time. Have Fun!!
 | product/productId: 5554452396 | review/userId: A2KW8K3Q5PAO2F | review/summary: One of the best films of all time? | review/text: In the final days of the last war, a badly burned man lies dying in an abandoned church in newly liberated Italy. With his memory of the past gone, the one purpose left in his life is to regain his memories before he  dies. As those memories come back, a story of love and tragedy  emerges.<p>This film appeals on very many different levels.<p>The story  that unfolds of the doomed love between The English Patient and the wife of  one of his fellow pilots and explorers really is a powerful tale.<p>But as  this is revealed, we also see the Patient struggling with a life whose only  purpose has become to try to survive for long enough to remember. We see  this man living parts of his life again as the memories  return.<p>Interwoven with this is the quest of the mysterious Carravagio to  find, confront and bring to justice the man whom he blames for the  mutilations that he suffered at the hands of the Germans.  <p>Then there is  the story of the Army Nurse, Juliette Binoche who, despite the conflicts  and tragedies that she sees remains totally committed to both her patient  and the man whom she comes to love.<p>If these story items are not enough,  the beautiful filming of Africa and Italy is real artistry. It's just  wonderful to look at. Even without characters and plot, the landscapes and  flying sequences would make it worth watching this film.<p>The acting is a  delight to view as well. The actors are confronted with roles that cannot  have been at all easy to portray. Despite this, every character in the film  is brought to life.<p>This film was showered with awards when first  released and it deserved every one of them. It's a great movie and you can  watch it over and over again and keep finding something new to think about.
 | product/productId: 6302069122 | review/userId: A2ZHH7AK83JB5G | review/summary: Great double feature | review/text: I rented this for I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE because  I was intrigued that it is supposedly "inspired" by Jane Eyre, perhaps my favorite book.  Well, like Jane Eyre it has a young woman in love with a man she works for who has a "mad" wife and both mad women had spent some time on tropical islands but the similarities pretty much end there.  The story told in ZOMBIE is compelling and though not pure horror is quite spooky at times.  The nurse taking the mad woman through the sugar canes to get to the voodoo ceremony was suspenseful and chilling and there are some other creepy touches throughout the movie.  The atmosphere of the island is deftly created by a soundtrack of songs and mysterious drumbeats as well as decent acting and believable sets.  The romance between the nurse and the "zombie's" husband was of secondary importance to the voodoo tale.<br /><br />  I wasn't even going to watch THE BODYSNATCHER but when I saw it had both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in it I thought it deserved a look.  The movie was well plotted and paced and the secondary story of the crippled little girl fit in well with the main plot line.  I don't know enough about 19th century Scotland to say the setting of the story is historically accurate but the movie sure gave the feeling and mood of that time and place.  And like "Zombie" this is a well told story that makes sense in it's context.  Karloff's acting as "the bodysnatcher" is great and Lugosi has a fairly minor part as a doctor's servant who tries to blackmail Karloff and is killed in a rather chilling scene.  The ending is a little over the top but I have to admit I liked it. Both movies are just a little over an hour a piece so they make a great double feature.
 | product/productId: 6301977688 | review/userId: A2L6QS8SVHT9RG | review/summary: An undeniable Hollywood masterpiece of wit & wisdom! | review/text: This is classic old-school Hollywood masterpiece at its best: with a total run time of 117 minutes, this is altogether a much-condensed version of Jane Austen's beloved tale, "Pride & Prejudice."  I love A&E's 6 hour version (which is more accurate to the book), but this shorter version is just such fun to watch & enjoy!<br /><br />When there are 5 unmarried daughters in any upper-class Regency family, it is sure to lead to trouble!  For Mrs. Bennett, the news of a rich, young bachelor (Mr. Bingley) moving to town, sends her into quite a tizzy!  She spends all her time scheming & plotting to marry her daughters off to any suitable gentleman in the neighborhood who will take them:  Jane, the eldest & prettiest, Elizabeth (our heroine), the second & wittiest, Mary, the third & bookish, Kittie, the fourth & silly, and Lydia, the fifth & silliest.  Mrs. Bennett has such a time keeping all her daughters in line, and all (*gasp*) without the help of a governess!  The antics of the Bennett family are sure to have you rolling in stitches...<br /><br />Greer Garson is simply excellent as Elizabeth "Lizzie" Bennett, and Laurence Olivier is wonderful as Mr. Darcy: Elizabeth is just so independent & intelligent, while Darcy is proud & haughty.  Their quick-witted, sometimes tongue-in-cheek dialogues are so entertaining to watch & enjoy!  All the cast is simply excellent: Miss Bingley so snotty, Lady Catherine de Bourg so supercilious, and on and on...<br /><br />This is one I have been waiting ages for the DVD release!  This is highly recommended as an amazing piece of Hollywood movie history!!

 | product/productId: 5559395153 | review/userId: A1YCIZ7N76Q5AH | review/summary: A timeless classic | review/text: Absolutely one of the best films ever made!<br /><br />This move encapsulates the essence of what Jesus died for! We watch a pompous tribune turn from being a self centered angry gambler and drunkard to a man tortured by his crimes against humanity when he crucifies Christ. When he sees the Light, his life is changed, and in the end he makes the ultimate sacrifice for the one thing worth dying for: one's faith in Christ!<br /><br />How tremendously sad that this movie was so moving in it's initial release that it won several academy awards, yet nowadays, the majority of people in Hollywood would be amongst the crowd at the end yelling "death" I was moved to tears at the attributes so clearly defined in all characters. The picture of what occurred during the first century in relation to Christianity was clearly painted. What a marvelous movie.<br /><br />Bravo!!

Not to mention, I simply cannot imagine the possible deleted scenes that would be available.  However, until such time, buy the VHS, because until those sales rise, we won't have a DVD.

 | product/productId: 0790729989 | review/userId: A2L4N0OT3CNCJE | review/summary: Brilliant Spin on the Seven Deadly Sins | review/text: Despite being an unnerving, gruesome, and at times, twisted film, Se7en directed by David Fincher takes an accurate look at today's society.<p>Granted, everything has been amplified, but by the end of the movie, you can clearly see a message being put forth to the viewer, and that is, the world that we live in is dark, disturbing, and full of sin.<p>Se7en, which was made in 1995, takes place in a crime-ridden district, where a fresh-face detective by the name of Mills (Brad Pitt) has just arrived and been paired with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is on the verge of retirement.<br />Although wise-mouthed and impatient, Mills' outlook on things is quite bright, while Somerset's is pessimistic, which quickly leads to a clash in styles.<p>Right off the bat, the duo is assigned to check out a murder where an obese man has apparently been forced to eat himself to death.<p>At first, it seems to be just an unusual murder, but Somerset soon sees a pattern being formed, following the murder of a high-powered lawyer, whose blood was used to write "Greed" on the floor of his office.<p>Somerset catches on that these two murders were based after two of the seven deadly sins, with the obese man's sin being gluttony, and the lawyer's, of course being greed.<p>Murders based on other deadly sins such as sloth and lust soon follow, with each one not being for the faint of heart, even though in each case, the victim is already dead when we finally see them.<p>Somerset concludes that the serial killer is using these murders to preach his sermon, and a small game of cat and mouse between the detectives and the killer ensues.<br />The mood of Se7en is projected nicely through its look; it's dark and gloomy, even indoors, colors with even a hint of brightness in them are used sparingly, and it's usually raining outside.<p>One dynamic that most people are sure to notice is the film's intelligent and unique dialogue, which can be credited to the film's writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, who didn't "dumb down" any of the film's dialogue.<p>The key characters in Se7en were well cast, with Pitt doing a fine job as the well-meaning but at times nave detective, and Freeman excelling in his role as the "seen it all" detective.<br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tracy, Mills' wife and is effective in the role, despite being seen infrequently throughout the film.<p>One of the more unique aspects of Se7en is that the killer makes his first appearance near the end, and provides a thought provoking little speech explaining his motive behind the murders.<p>This is really a strong element, when you take a look at so many other movies that feature a murderer who is killing for no apparent reason (or whose reason for killing is quite lackluster).<p>To some, the ending may seem unsatisfying, but in my eyes, it just sent home the film's message via a cruel twist.<br />Overall, Se7en will have you on the edge of your seat for two hours, but unlike other films that do that; this one will provoke your mind, leaving you full of thoughts at its conclusion.

 | product/productId: 0800130928 | review/userId: A2QN6WUEPY82P2 | review/summary: The case for delirium | review/text: The ending of Taxi Driver has generated a lot of controversy and confusion because most people tend to assume that it's a simple continuation of the narrative of the film.  In critical studies, however, the possibility is often raised that the end (after the  the shoot-out scene to the end of the movie) is no less than Bickle's dying delirious imagination.  I want to set forth the case that this is so.<p>First, at the end of the shoot-out scene, Bickle rolls his eyes backwards in the classic movie signature of death.  Just before, of course, he put his blood-dripping finger up to his temple and mimed blowing his own brains out (after having failed with the empty real guns).  Bickle is suicidal, dying, and will not recover.<p>Second, after this scene the camera pans across various news clippings on the wall of Bickle's room; these clippings describe him as a "hero" that saved a young girl.  Also we hear the voice-over of Iris' parents saying that Bickle would always be welcome in their home for saving Iris.  But think about real life crimes for a moment.  When newspapers report about a man that goes on a shooting spree in a run-down part of town, do they really ever report them as "heroes"?  Even if Bickle could explain to them why he did this (Iris' dad says he was in a coma after the shoot-out), would anyone really take a person like this at their word?  And would Iris' parents really want to allow a murderous man a place at their table?  What we have here is Bickle's fantasy about how he _wants_ the press and Iris' folks to interpret his actions, not a realistic view of how the world generally views such actions.<p>Third (along the same lines as #2), it's hard to imagine Bickle's buddies at the cabstand glossing over his rampage and treating him like old times.  Really, if a co-worker of mine were involved in so violent an incident, I would probably not hang out with him so blithely.  This is Travis imaginging that things are "back to normal" after getting out of the hospital -- a fantasy of peace.<p>Fourth, Bickle happens to find Betsy in his cab soon after returning to work.  How fortuitous in a city of millions!  But their conversation shows that she now respects him, considers him a hero like the newspapers and Iris' parents.  Again, extremely unlikely -- especially given their history.  In real life if she heard about the rampage (or recognized him trying to kill Palentine), that would only tend to confirm her earlier opinion of him as a depraved person.  But here she also interprets his actions in the way he wants them to be interpreted (that he saved Iris from the human scum that were selling her) rather than how she probably would in real life.  (Also note that the photography of this scene always shows Betsy's face from his viewpoint, floating in a dreamlike way in his rear-view mirror.)<p>Fifth, when Bickle drops Betsy off she seems uncertain, embarrased, and demure, and is obviously just on the verge of offering some kind of intimate apology.  Instead she asks how much is the fare.  He drives off without accepting a dime.  This is Bickle's triumph -- he wins their relationship battle by rejecting _her_, and by being confident, independent, and morally superior.  Typical subconscious inversion tactic.<p>Sixth, as he drives off, Bickle sees himself in the car's rear-view mirror, then adjusts it to see if he can see Betsy.  As he does so, a violent wrench is given to the accompanying musical score.  Then we see no one in the mirror at all as the credits roll to Bernard Hermann's haunting love theme.  There's nothing in the mirror (except the rolling, ubiquitous city) because Travis is not there.  Its symbolic of his death -- like that of a vampire -- that the mirror doesn't show his reflection.  Travis is dead and we have just witnessed his last thoughts.<p>Travis is only a hero in his own mind.  There is no hero in this movie.  It does not have a happy ending.  Travis continues to justify his own behavior and viewpoint to the last, and grants himself a kind of sainthood -- beatified by the press, Iris' parents, and Betsy's acquiescence.<p>The tragedy of the movie is deepend by this reading of its end.  To my mind, this also makes the movie more coherent, since it's main theme is the psychological isolation of Travis Bickle.  The end consumates his separateness.  Others will never connect to his vision of himself as a master (rather than a victim) of circumstance, a protector of innocence, a scourge of evildoers, an instrument of God's judgement.

It also seemed as if not many had DVD players either.<br /><br />I watched this alot on DVD(origianl).  When this new one came out, I did not buy it because I already had it.  I knew that it needed remastering bad.  I did not know how bad until I watched on a HDTV!  Like "Strange Days," the original "Scarface" was encoded in the wrong way.  On an HDTV, you have to resize it to fill the screen.  That is the reason I decided to purchase this newer version.<br /><br />Without telling the story, this version has encoded the disc correctly.  Qulaity wise, there does not seem to be much difference between this and the old one.  This one has taken the very strong film grain of the original out.  It has been replaced be a smoother picture at the expense of some detail.  I guess this may be good.  The strong film grain was really noticable on a SDTV.  If you have to get it, of course get this one.
 | product/productId: 0792841808 | review/userId: A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z | review/summary: One of Costner's First Good Films | review/text: Roger Donaldson's 1987 film regarding the intrigues of the Department of Defense and the Pentagon starring Kevin Costner, Sean Young, and Gene Hackman.<br /><br />Costner is a navy officer and C.I.A. operative who starts having a risky relationship with the mistress (Sean Young) of the Secretary of Defense (Gene Hackman.)  When the Secretary of Defense accidentally kills her, Costner is made a scape goat to cover up the potential scandal: he's accused of being a KGB mole. The story then becomes a cat-and-mouse game between the U.S. Government and Costner on the run.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Costner's better movies and the film carries the suspense quite well.  Costner's limited acting talents are also complemented by those of Gene Hackman.  This is a better movie to rent as it counts on mystery to carry the suspense which is resolved at the end of the film.

Yet it was made with exceptional fine detail. I've watched it time and time again over recent years and it never ceases to amaze me at well thought out and acted it is.<br /><br />The scenes flow from 1 to another.<br /><br />Every line, emotion, and reaction by every character in every scene is carefully scripted, acted, and benefitial, and because of that you're able to watch the movie itself of different scenes over and over focusing on a different characters.<br /><br />Not a wasted line or view in the entire movie. There is underlying humor to be discovered by watching it over and over as well, it just never fails to entertain.<br /><br />The characters are more than affable, and their is story within the story and humor within the humor. But you have to be able to think at times and discover some of it for yourself. Way to much to expect from so many mainstream movie fans anymore, which is much the reason some people might not enjoy it.<br /><br />It certainly seems to be the type of movie that tends to bring about strict black or white opinions.
 | product/productId: 5559791539 | review/userId: A207IYGZTAF0DS | review/summary: Frightening | review/text: In the tradition of the "Apocalypse" and "Left Behind" series, this is another Christian movie based on biblical prophecies. If you've seen any of those you know the story: Antichrist takes over the world and bans Christianity. Christians are put into some sort of prison camp until they agree to take the mark of the beast, or get executed.<br /><br />The moral is that it's better to die as a martyr than to survive in AntiChrist society and end up in hell for denouncing your faith. This intention of this movie is not to entertain, but to scare the viewer into becoming a Christian - or if you're already a Christian - stick to your faith, or else.... This is a message that only true religious zealots can sympathise with. It is an insult to anyone who has ever lived under oppression and fought back, rather than just lay down and die, for a supersticious fear of eternal damnation. If you think dying for your faith is admirable, remember that's what suicide bombers do. It is frightening indeed, that movies with this type of message is made in these supposed civilized times.
 | product/productId: 6301269780 | review/userId: A3A4WQL80WOTMH | review/summary: Dead Movie.. | review/text: The Amazon review and all the other hype on this listing might suggest that this is an interesting movie.  Quite the contrary actually.  Though it started off well, it was frustrating how long and slow it was in reaching its anti-climactic ending.  Gimme a break, is about all I could think from the second half on, and for more than one reason.  A ridiculously convoluted, wanna-be artsy plot and typical melodramatic overacting compliments of Jeremy Irons are only half the bargain in Dead Ringers.  The other half is a more or less glacially slow film, that may keep you watching till the end only to realize you'd have done better turning it off and going to bed.<br /><br />If you liked him in Damaged, then you may enjoy this as well.  I will say it wasn't quite as bad as Damaged in terms of melodrama, but it does have a fair dose of 80s cheese about it and yes the 'artiste's' over-zealous flair. Damaged tried to be art, and so did this one, albeit creepier than average "art".  Yes, there's something of a gimmick in Irons playing twin brothers with opposite personalities at the same time, and yes, it must have been a trick to get two Jeremy Irons on the screen at once - but beyond this the movie doesn't have much going for it. Its logic and character motivation make sense only in the mind of the twins - the audience will be thinking "What?!".  Also, they should have chosen a more attractive female lead.  Her acting was ok but was hard to believe Irons would let himself go to pieces over her.<br /><br />Final analysis: Dead Ringers tries to create a world, a situation, which never comes off as fully convincing, is occasionally self-consciously over-acted by Irons himself, and finally is nothing less than boring from well before it's half over. In terms of generating interest, it comes nowhere close to Cronenberg's better films "The Fly" or "Videodrome".

 | product/productId: 0792157869 | review/userId: A3UDYY6L2NH3JS | review/summary: Let's burn books and Hitler on top | review/text: Spielberg was well inspired again and anew after the badly thought second episode and he brought his Indiana Jones back to the Nazi time and context. It's clear and some of the scenes, including the meeting with Adolf Hitler himself are sickeningly obnoxious and hilariously crystal clear: Hitler is evil, he burns books, he kills people, he enjoys it and he is surrounded by the scum of humanity. But Spielberg goes one iota further and introduces his version of the American Nazi and this one is worse than Adolf Hitler himself, he has no historical ambition or vision just plain personal and self centered egotistic interest. He is a Nazi out of pure opportunism and that is even worse evil than Nazism itself. But Spielberg gets to another dimension too by introducing Indiana Jones's father and Sean Connery does quite a credible father of that crazy adventurer, or should I say adventuring archaeology professor. But one improvement is never enough for our Spielberg and this time the main woman is an evil traitor, a Nazi that prefers dying to letting the prey of her hunt go, even when it is obviously too late and out of reach. And that prey is the Holy Grail, mind you. This time the myth is a good western myth, Christian what's more. And this myth needs a delicate treatment but has immense possibilities for us and these possibilities are used right to the end. So we discover the underground catacombs of Venice and their rats, a good old chase on a train transporting a circus and all its animals, a sacred temple in Jordan and all kinds of religious symbols and traps, and the winners are those who believe in and respect these symbols, and that has to be Indiana Jones and his father. Too bad for all the others: the treasure hunter who takes the most beautiful and golden chalice and dies on the spot after drinking from it, the greedy woman who disappears in the depth of the earth, and all the other bad guys and bad boys. Some scene are superb like the crazy German tank in the desert. Every detail is hilarious and suspenseful and even a second viewing, or probably even more, is as effective as the first one. Very well inspired indeed this time, this famous Spielberg, but since he made Dr Jones Senior drink the water of eternal life in the Holy Grail itself, he is doomed to go on and on with that legend. The fourth episode has already been produced and Harrison Ford has just announced a few days ago he was ready to get into the adventure of a fifth episode, now he has been provided with a son in this fourth episode: he has to guide the new Junior into the next stage of the quest.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

 | product/productId: 6301879260 | review/userId: A2BDQQ39DJ826Y | review/summary: Mediocre crime movie simply goes through the motions | review/text: This movie is better than Sunset Grill, another marginal, grim, murky film in which Peter Weller plays a tough, honest loner taking on a powerful criminal conspiracy.  But it may be less interesting than that strangely quirky, offbeat movie.  Rainbow Drive is a thoroughly undistinguished dud, which is especially disappointing given its talented, recognizable cast and its origin in a Roderick Thorp novel.<br /><br />Waking at dawn in the bed of a married woman (Kathryn Harrold), Weller, as the chief of detectives in Hollywood, hears strange sounds coming from the house next door. He discovers five dead bodies, neatly killed in their beds, sees a man running away, and fruitlessly gives chase to a fleeing car. By the time he returns to the crime scene, the "big city" cops - represented by a blowhard chief running for mayor and his ice-cold lackey assistant (David Caruso) - have already moved in on the case and frozen out Weller's local office. A woman's body mysteriously disappears from the house and shows up in another location, the four remaining, male bodies in the house are quickly written off as victims of a drug-related gang crime, and Weller's partner (Bruce Weitz) soon dies in a car crash after having tried to warn Weller off the case.<br /><br />Seething with suspicions about his partner's death and what appears to be a big-scale cover-up, Weller digs into the case.  But he is hampered by warnings from higher-ups to keep away and by not being able to divulge that he had discovered the five bodies at the house because that would also mean revealing that he had been with the married woman next door. He is fed clues by a lovely, intelligent woman (Sela Ward) who tells him she is a psychiatrist "profiling" the mass killing.  Despite the lock-down on access to the case, she seems to have free run of the crime scene and the case files. Weller enlists the reluctant help of a sympathetic but cowardly coroner and of a fidgety but dutiful cop, who provides various wiretapping and other gadgets (like a "pen gun" more fitting in a low-budget spy film). Along the way, Weller leaves unanswered phone messages for Harrold, takes a late-night swim in the pool at his house (how did he afford that?), shares a kiss and a hug on the couch with Ward, finds his house is bugged, and survives a clumsy attempt on his life.<br /><br />The trail leads to a sleazy nightclub. It turns out to be a money laundering "front" for unidentified corrupt activities of a high-society big-shot, who is so evil as to have "butchered" the people in the house, including an intimate, for attempting blackmail. Weller tracks down and beats the truth out of a punk who sold out the others in the house but apparently has managed to stay alive by hiding evidence as "insurance" (that conveniently only Weller gets him to admit and then finds). An FBI agent surfaces, claims to be conducting a long-term investigation, and tries to warn Weller off. But he slugs the agent and bulls ahead alone into a final confrontation and gun battle. It leaves a pile of dead bodies, except for the big-shot, who slips away. After the FBI bursts on the scene, declares Weller's use of a wire "illegal," and berates him for blowing the chance to nail the top person, Weller shakes his head and walks away, with the cynical exit line, "The important ones never get caught." The credits roll.<br /><br />This movie is more serious and less uneven than Sunset Grill, which came off as weirdly tongue-in-cheek. Weller looks quite different than he did there, here as a clean-cut, suit-and-tie chief.  Again, he does an adequate, straight-ahead job.  Popular supporting actors are on hand, like Caruso, Ward, Weitz, Harrold, and Megan Mullally.<br /><br />But the talent is wasted in a weak, flat, unoriginal effort at a "gritty crime thriller." The story is choppy, trite, and undeveloped. Weller's "investigation" is flimsy and confusing, and his tactics are unprofessional and self-defeating. The movie lacks wit or feeling. For a movie set in "Hollywood," the film offers nothing more than dirty, dingy shots that seem like they could have come from many other places.  The music by Tangerine Dream is barely noticeable and completely unmemorable.<br /><br />None of the characters is interesting or engaging, and it is hard to follow who they all are. Weller's brooding, opaque character soon becomes tiresome. Caruso and Ward do good jobs, but they have only thin, limited roles. Harrold is a glorified extra, given nothing more to do than look pretty, fill out a nightgown, and banter with Weller in one trivial scene. Mullally fares only slightly better in the bit part of (I think) a loudmouth friend of the murdered woman. (I did not even see the cute blonde on the box cover in the movie.)  Here, Weitz wears loud, checkered sport coats, chews with his mouth open, and by all appearances is a spineless, good-for-nothing smart-aleck whose only contributions are to keep repeating that "Rainbow Drive is not our case" and to suddenly blurt out that he sold out his badge years ago by letting a VIP hit-and-run driver go before other cops arrived. Yet we are supposed to care about this nothing, amateurishly drawn character, who the movie belatedly and implausibly tries to turn into a hero by saying he "knew something" and was "tracking down a lead" when he died.<br /><br />TV Guide billed this as a "whodunit." It is more like a "who-didn't-dun-it" and a "why'd-they-bother-to-make-it." Everything in the movie, including the tone, look, feel, settings, and characters, exists only to conjure up a superficial effect -- a cynical, bad attitude and image of a cesspool of corruption. All that is accomplished in the end is an uninspired, shallow, murky, disorganized, depressing, pointless police procedural that is not meaningful or satisfying but instead merely goes through the motions.
 | product/productId: 6300988694 | review/userId: A1S3C5OFU508P3 | review/summary: The character of Mira Romaine needed to be expanded to explain why she is Scotty's love interest | review/text: The biggest weakness of this episode is the introduction of the new character of Mira Romaine with nothing provided in the way of background. She is a major love interest of Scotty, so overplayed that he is absent from his beloved engines. Some background about her should have been provided to explain why Scotty has fallen for her in such a way. There are some good points, in my opinion the best is where Spock is at the science station trying to determine what the energy storm is. You can see Kirk's impatience in his eyes and mannerisms, yet he waits quietly for Spock to complete his analysis.<br /> Another high point is the introduction of the idea of Memory Alpha, a repository of all the knowledge possessed by the Federation. However, this concept is somewhat poorly handled when the knowledge is destroyed. In the future world of Star Trek, it would not be easy to destroy knowledge and the planners of the archives would have made certain that it was hardened against all possible destructive forces. I also am a fan of the garbled speech patterns of the people infected by the energy creature, the first time I saw it I thought it quite spooky.<br /> While this is a poor episode, it does have some good points, and in the relative weakness of the last episodes of the third season, that makes it somewhat of a standout.

In the Lovecraft-inspired HAUNTED PALACE, Vincent plays Charles Dexter Ward, the heir to a castle in the seaport village of Arkham. Said castle was once inhabited by Ward's warlock ancestor, Joseph Curwyn (Price). Curwyn was burned alive by the townfolk, causing him to curse their families forever! Now, one hundred and ten years later, Ward takes up residence in the castle, terrifying the superstitious villagers to no end. Will he fulfill the ancient curse upon Arkham? Will he use the odious Necronomicon in order to call forth the Elder gods? HAUNTED PALACE is nice and gloomy w/ lots of magik, murder, and mutants! TOWER OF LONDON has Vincent as the insane, totally homicidal Richard III. He will stop at nothing to secure his place on the throne of England. Anyone in his way is terminated expeditiously. Uh-Oh! Richard didn't count on being pestered by the ghosts of his victims! He is soon over-run by spirits seeking only to have him join them. This Corman / Price twin bill belongs on every horror shelf...

 | product/productId: 630197767X | review/userId: A3RTMB76CJWY9U | review/summary: Ladies, Be Not Afraid | review/text: It finally happened--my fiancee consented and agreed to watch Rocky with me.<br /><br />Being female, she was quite hesitant to watch it. After all, Rocky is Sylvester Stallone in one of his most famous "macho" roles. It is a movie about boxing. A guy movie for sure, right? She thought she was in for two hours of torture.<br /><br />But it was not to be so: just like I said she would, she actually liked Rocky. She liked it alot.<br /><br />That's because (as she pointed out after the movie) Rocky isn't a movie about boxing. Not really. It is about a man who has been a disappointment to himself in life, who gets a second chance--the chance of a lifetime--and makes good. It is a movie about redemption. It is a movie about the American Dream.<br /><br />It is a classic film (Best Picture winner, in fact), and is compelling to human beings of either gender. So, ladies, be not afraid to see this film. Gentlemen, be not afraid to show it to your girlfriends/fiancees/wives. Quite likely they will be surprised by how much they'll enjoy it.

His reasearch, his facts and suppositions are all impressive. Read it to follow the Von Daniken trail but don't start with this one

 | product/productId: 0790729989 | review/userId: A3KF46HP60GDFX | review/summary: Creepy and bizarre, but well done | review/text: Before watching a few other movies about vicious serial killers, I thought I'd seen the worst depiction of human cruelty in this film. Having said that, this film is very well done, but if you have a weak stomache, I don't recommend it. On the other hand, if you got through 8mm( by the same script writer-Andrew Kevin Walker) unscathed, you should be fine. Certain scenes, mostly the kill scenes, sent chills down my spine. It is a very good movie, and worth owning for the psychology behind it alone, but don't watch it after dark, that's a precaution. The story, though not original by today's standards, is chilling, to say the least, but the actors do an excellent job with their roles, Kevin Spacey as the killer does a great job being creepy, showing no remorse for his actions, thinking he was chosen by God...to kill, make sense? Didn't think so! Check it out, if you haven't already.

I love Adam Sandler, but I don't think you have to be a fan of his to enjoy this movie. He is more mellow in this movie than in most of his other movies. It has a lot of the same people in it that are normally always in his movies. This movie has me laughing from beginning to end. One of my favorite parts is when Jon Lovits is behind the curtain listening to Adam Sandler singing his song. Drew Barrymore is great too! I never get tired of watching this movie. If you havn't seen this movie, you need to. Go rent it now! Go ahead! It also has an amazing soundtrack, two seperate cd's, full of great 80's songs!
 | product/productId: 1558908242 | review/userId: A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX | review/summary: A few brief comments | review/text: As this movie already has hundreds of reviews (many by much more knowledgable movie fans than I) I just had a few brief comments on this film, mostly related to a particular aspect of the movie that I liked that I hadn't seen discussed yet.<br /><br />Probably Tarantino's best or at least well-known film, the movie is filled with ironic twists of fate or perhaps ironic juxtapositions (I'm not sure what else to call it). For example, the two main characters (played by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) are a couple of amiable hit-men who are perfectly friendly and civilized as long as you're not on their little list of people to eliminate, as they go around cheerfully discussing philosophy, sex, and the meaning of life while offing their boss's enemies. But Travolta himself comes to an untimely demise after sitting on the pot after leaving his gun in the kitchen when Bruce Willis goes back to retrieve his father's watch. The watch makes an interesting symbol, because neither Travolta nor Willis has time to lose messing around with, in Travolta's case, nature's call, or in Willis's case, sentimental keepsakes. Marcellus Wallace, their employer, is busy trying to screw the boxing fans by fixing fights, but he in turns gets, well, the same treatment from the two B & D types in the store. Not to mention what happens to Wallace when Willis in his car meets up with Wallace in the crosswalk, and the fact that Willis double-crosses Wallace by refusing to throw the fight, thereby double-crossing the double-crosser. And so on and so on. I enjoyed this clever and funny aspect of the movie and it probably remains my favorite among Tarantino's films. Plus Harvey Keitel is great as the guy who can fix even the worst of Travolta and Jackson's screw-ups and misadventures.
 | product/productId: 0767819446 | review/userId: A39RX8GDG1GU4 | review/summary: An Entertaining Film | review/text: Every so often I rent a science fiction movie that either never made it to the big screen, or went through so quickly I never got a chance to see it. You never know when you will find a gem. &quot;The 13th Floor&quot; is one of those movies. It's not a gem, but it's not bad, either.<p>The movie  involves the efforts of a man to unravel the death of a business partner in  a high tech industry. The twist is the dead man was using experimental  technology to transport himself into a virtual reality world where the  inhabitants are not aware they are not real. When the hero is framed for  the murder, he must enter this virtual reality to discover the truth before  the real murderer or the police catch up with him.<p>This is not &quot;The  Matrix,&quot; and is more reminiscent of the tepidly received thriller  &quot;Dark City,&quot; though not quite as complex and difficult to follow.  &quot;The 13th Floor&quot; lacks eye-popping effects, but the film is  entertaining and thoughtful with enough action to keep the film moving. The  filmmakers don't spend very long explaining the technology, and that's a  good idea. This allows the film to play both as a murder mystery and sci-fi  thriller.<p>There is an interesting twist to this movie, that you may guess  before it's revealed. The filmmakers do enough to allow the careful viewer  to figure it out. This is an easy movie with a few surprises. That's a  pretty good rental in any genre.

 | product/productId: 6300253228 | review/userId: A1XAR44IW48IEK | review/summary: Black and White | review/text: Like Christopher Columbus, Martin Luther is one of world History's Great movers who left his mark on the world. He was not a General. He was not an artist. He was not a politician or builder of buildings. He did not see himself as a Holy man like the Apostles but only as a humble reformer in a corrupt church.<br /><br />Black and White is the format of this film. It is also the way in which the Great Uncompromising Christian Reformer is portayed. From the day he abandons his legal studies and promising future legal career. Through his ordination and his early inner troubles with God, Man's Relationship with God and Luther's own inner demons. His kindly mentor who takes Luther under his wing and then does his best to stear him right. First sending him to Rome (BIG Mistake for the Catholic Church establishment) and then to study scripture where Luther finds God and the truth about him. First his discovwery of the loving Word. Then his questions of Relics. His finding in Paul Salvation by Faith. His question of Indulgences.<br /><br />Then in comes Leo X one of the Catholic Church's more mediocre Poples and his ambitions for the arts and the Church and a certain Archbishop who wants one more territory but is short of  money. Admittedly, I feel they misportrayed Tetzel. This film makes him out as a bumbling Used Car dealer. But Tetzel really did believe in Indulgences and what he was selling to be genuine. He believed he was selling a real cure to afflicted people. Every coin he took in for indulgences he turned over to his church leaders. (And when Tetzel lay dying, lying in disgrace in a remote monostary, the only one who had anything nice to say for him was Luther. Luther actually wrote Tetzel a very comforting letter when he heard he was ill and dying).<br /><br />But Luther's outrage at this shake down of the German peasanty and the the 95 Thesis Luther nailed to the Church Door for all to see is quite genuine. Written in Latin to spark enlightend debate within the Church. Some fellow apparently read it. Liked what he read. Copied it. Translated it into German. Showed it to his friends who liked what it said. And then somebody put both latin and German copies on a Printing Press (the internet of its time) and then the whole corrupt house comes tumbling down.<br /><br />Luther did not want to destroy or harm the Catholic Church. He saw it was corrupt and wished the Establishment to clean up the corruption. Problem was the Establishment was the Corruption. The film is quite clear.<br /><br />Just as it shows Luther's worst experiences. What happened was what he dreaded most. The house of the Catholic Church was corrupt and rotten and near collapse. The reformer had to build a shelter for his flock and the Christian people. And apparently took to the line He who is not with me is against me as he established his church and the Reformation began. His marriage to an escaped Nun is also covered. They had six children but few know they raised four orphans as well.<br /><br />Still, for what it is worth, this is a great biography of the Great Reformer.

Also, this movie has some fun with some of the characters names like: Dr. A. Tomic, Professor I. M. Learned, and X-Ray. When Pat Patton is in a taxidermy store, there is a sign on the wall that says Y Stuffem. Also Junior and Vitamin Flinthart are not in this one. The Pat Patton character provides some comic relief, but is not dim witted as in the last two films. Basically the plot reviles around Gruesome, who just escaped from prison and is hooked up with his old crime buddy Melody, a piano player. To make a long story short Gruesome steals with the aide of a scientist formula to freeze people for a short amount of time while they rob a bank. Dick Tracy finds out and tries to save the day. The in the final battle between Dick Tracy and Gruesome is play out like one of the cliff hanger chapters in the Dick Tracy Republic Pictures serials. This movie marks the fourth and final installment of the Dick Tracy movies. Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome gets an AAA+++.

But I have to say I would disagree about the Academy's decision to give Jones the Oscar.  That year other actors could have received the Oscar John Malkovich for In the Line of Fire, Pete Poseltwete for In the Name of the Father, and Ralph Fiennes for Schindler's List.  I watched this movie several times, Jones does give a good performance but I bet no one expected him to win the Oscar. Jones gives a performance that is so low-key that a moment or two gave a great impression to the Academy.  For example, Jason Robards for both All The President's and Julia, Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine, , Cuba Gooding Jr. for Jerry Maguire and Jack Palance for City Slickers.

 | product/productId: 0790750627 | review/userId: A31U2QT7SAL7K | review/summary: Hitchcock, Grant, and Herrmann....WUNDEBAR! | review/text: Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual ("Vertigo" and "Psycho"), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick. "North by Northwest" features a cross-country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's "Roger Thornhill" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!) and our own government (headed by Hitchcock stalwart Leo G. Carroll). Eva Marie-Saint, though not as alluring as other Hitchcock "blonds" adds the right blend of mystery and sex appeal to her character. Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.<br /><br />So, set your travel plans to include a trip "North by Northwest."

 | product/productId: 1603780920 | review/userId: A2BO71LC5FLOSY | review/summary: Randy Rhoads Rules !!!! | review/text: This is a very solid instructional video from Cherry Lane --Featuring Danny Gill. It has four songs (Mr.Crowley, Crazy Train, Revelation (Mother Earth) and I Don't Know) off the first album Blizzard of Ozz and four songs (Dairy of a Madman, You Can't Kill Rock and Roll, Flying High Again, Little Dolls) off the second album Dairy of a Madman which Randy co-wrote and played. So you have you Five out of the Six songs Randy considers his favorite songs from these two albums, the Sixth being "Over the Mountain" which I felt should have been in there myself (my choice would be to have it over "I Don't Know"). The Five other songs are, if your curious, "Revelation, Mr Crowley, Dairy, Flying High Again, Rock and Roll" which were his favorites.<br /><br />It does have 2 DVD's and the running time is 4 hrs and 48mins. I was taking a gamble with this order because it has the wrong description for this item from Amazon. Danny goes through each song showing you in moderate musically terms, the rhythms and leads fully for each song. Having said that, if you are a Beginner to Intermediate player this will be good for you if you are disciplined enough to learn these songs all the way through off of this DVD. He does go slow enough to learn each bar and phrase of the song. If you are Intermediate to Excellent player you should have no problem with the musically terms and the fact that there are NO Tabs.<br /><br />It does NOT show On-Screen Tablature of what Danny is doing but, if you have the Tab books from Cherry Lane of these albums <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157560437X">Ozzy Osbourne - Blizzard of Ozz (Play-It-Like-It-Is)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1575600137">Ozzy Osbourne - Diary of a Madman</a> you can follow through that way too. (NOTE: only 95% of what Danny does and the Tab books correspond exactly, The 5% you can decide which way you want to play it). I like to have both Visual and Written to learn if I can so these books will help alot.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for was Danny's fingering on some chords, he makes it harder than it needs to be ---Expl. on Dairy.<br /><br />Good Luck and Keep Rocking !!!!<br />R.R. Forever
 | product/productId: 6301115430 | review/userId: A1T2E1SY35D6ML | review/summary: GREAT MOVIE.......POOR DVD | review/text: This movie more than stands on its own. Charlie Sheehan is a rich  kid who actually volunteered to go to Vietnam. His performance is admirable and  makes you wonder what happened to his career. Tom Berringer and William  Dafoe are oustanding as two seargants with two very different opinions on  how the war should be fought.  The movie centers around the atrocities of  war. Good imagery, good score, and good supporting cast members make this a  five star movie that was very deserving of the 86 academy award for best  picture.<p>So....why a four star rating? Well I rated the DVD and not just  the film. To keep it simple, there are NO EXTRAS. No extra scenes, no  interviews, no making of special, no commentary options. I love this film  so I bought the DVD. You can't beat the price but I would have paid more  for interesting extras.
 | product/productId: 0790741970 | review/userId: A1YDDQ6YCN678K | review/summary: Director Hugh Hudson's Best Film | review/text: I've always thought "Chariots of Fire" was an over-rated bore, and "Greystoke" was an incongruously stuffed-shirt version of an enjoyable pulp source. But in "Revolution", Hugh Hudson had a canvas that was well-suited to his sumptuous visuals. This is one of the best looking films I've seen. The 1770's may well have looked and felt the way this film looks and feels. Kubrick and Terence Malick (referenced by Hudson in the extras) really did come to mind when I first saw this years ago. And now, in retrospect, Michael Mann's "Last of the Mohicans". Or Ridley Scott's historicals.<br /><br />Strangely, like the later (ironically titled?) "The Patriot" (or the earlier Civil War film "Shenandoah") the protagonist gets involved in the conflict mainly because of his son, rather than idealism. The big issues that led to America's independence must be hard to present cinematically.  A fault of both films is the caricature villainy of the British military. Shorthand for myriad abuses of the colonists, I suppose.<br /><br />Criticisms of Pacino's accent are all based on what, exactly? First hand knowledge of Eighteenth Century dialects in a multi-cultural colonial region? As for the "muddled storytelling", the new Pacino narration added for the Revisited release adds some context, and, just as importantly, another layer of dramatic effect. Admirable that the star and director came back to this project after decades to try to improve its unjustly bad rep. Sadly, to me, one of the few scenes that Hudson eliminated was my favorite shot of the whole film: a really long tracking shot that must have been a pain to set up, but was apparently in service of a scene imposed by the studio that Hudson disagreed with, so out it came when he got the chance. Now I have to look for earlier home versions of the film (I'd been waiting years for a letterboxed release) to make sure I'm remembering that scene correctly. Anyone know if there's a widescreen disc or tape of the original theatrical version?
 | product/productId: 0783226055 | review/userId: A29O2PKTLCWFQF | review/summary: Most emotional picture I've ever seen | review/text: Enough has already been said about the story of this movie, so I will not go into details. I'm sad however at how much people have already given away. The power of Vertigo is seeing it for the first time and being surprised. It always leaves me asking deep human questions. True the story is simple, but its also human. The reason this film has become popular is because it reaches people emotions and isn't so far fetched from our own experiences. A lot of people, I believe, can identify with some part of this story, bring home the fact it's meant to be personal and not just get the plot right.<br /><br />  I love the music, U might say I'm obsessed with it. The music adds to the emotionality of this movie and is like another character. There is definitely a theme song throughout the movie but it stays so unique that one never notices the similarity because it is masterfully woven together with the movie itself. Color is another character and is musical in an ethereal way. Red and green are the dominant colors but a whole array of colors are used in this film.<br /><br />  Jimmy Stewart....one of the greatest actors of all time and my personal favorite actor...he does play the everyman in this film, because he's human. He struggles with fear and illusions and obsessions and other powerful human struggles and this makes Stewart great in this film. Kim Novak is spellboundingly beautiful! Her blonde figure, particulary stands out against greens and reds, which I'm sure Hitchcock planned out. Stewart is the more extroverted and Novak is the introvert. Their opposite personalities add to the drama of the story and make it what it is...a masterpiece.
 | product/productId: 6300214672 | review/userId: A2CT2SA6KFE8GC | review/summary: Watch it.  You Know You've Been Wanting To | review/text: I'm willing to bet you've put this film off for years.  I'm sure you've seen it at the video store numerous times throughout the years, and you may have been intrigued by the cover with the chick holding the knife behind her back with her hair in a noose.  Well, it may not be worth all those years of putting it off, but you'd might as well take that plunge now that the film is out on dvd.  Ya know, this movie is actually pretty good considering it's a slasher flick.  Slasher flicks aren't exactly the mark of quality, but this one has some decent performances and a good script that actually conjures up a few scares.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't gonna keep you up all night or anything, but with a formulatic genre like this, April Fool's Day manages to be kinda spooky.  And it's actually funny too!  Alot of slasher flicks can't quite pull off the humor thing, but this movie actually manages to be laugh out loud funny.  The humor and scares can be put down to some very good performances by the young cast.  Most slasher flicks have acting that leaves much to be desired, but I'd have to say this movie has the best acting of any slasher flick I've seen(and I've seen many).  The ending of this film gets mixed opinions.  Some people see it as a letdown, while others find it quite original.  I'm in the latter category, but it's one of those endings that's only gonna work once.  Similar to Primal Fear or The Sixth Sense, the twist is good for the first viewing only, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy watching it again.  Just make sure you watch it with someone who hasn't seen it before.

 | product/productId: 6302424739 | review/userId: AGTECQ01OG8F7 | review/summary: Simply perfect | review/text: There are many excellent reviews of this film here, it's hard to know what to say in addition to them to convey just how delightful this film is. I've lost track of how many times I've watched it, it one of those films you go back to when your not sure what you want to see, when your mood is hard to define. It took a long time for me to work out why this film has such a hold on me, then 'the penny dropped' it's real life! Not the imagination of a talented writer of fiction, but the simply telling of something that actually happened to real people. It shows why the written word makes us so special, how humans can create a bond of friendship that can overcome distance and separation, that it can be possible to form a lasting, meaninful, bond with someone you've never met and lives thousands of miles away. Bancroft and Hopkins put in stellar performances, the story is allowed to tell itself in it's own time, at an appropriate pace. This is a film which restores your faith in humanity and makes you feel better just for investing a little bit of your time viewing it, personally I'd give it 10 stars if it were possible.

 | product/productId: 0780616456 | review/userId: A2TXR85WQLE32N | review/summary: A Fistfull of Dollars for the Chicago Mob... | review/text: 1996's "Last Man Standing" is a remake of the Clint Eastwood classic "A Fistfull of Dollars", itself derivative of an earlier Japanese samurai classic.  In this version, Bruce Willis is the mysterious drifter who wanders into a dusty 1930's town in the American Southwest, where two rival gangs from Chicago, one Irish, one Italian, duel over prohibition liquor smuggling from Mexico.  As in earlier films, the stranger who calls himself "John Smith" sells his very lethal services to the highest bidder, while the rivalry between the gangs literally becomes a war to the death.<br /><br />Director Walter Hill is only partially successful in laying down an atmospheric thriller over several gunfight sequences.  The respective Irish and Italian gangs seem more like stereotypes than the real thing.  Fortunately, the gunfights are nicely staged and excellently choreographed.<br /><br />Willis is entirely credible as a gunman on the run and down on his luck, injecting his everyman vulnerability into a role more easily played as a heartless killer.  A sequence in which "Smith" clears a house of armed gang members, shooting and reloading twin .45 caliber automatic pistols with almost balletic grace, is a highpoint of the movie.<br /><br />Christopher Walken, pitch-perfect as a psychotic killer for the Irish mob, is "Smith's" most dangerous opponent.  The movie implies the two men have a history from Chicago, and their final confrontation will determine the "last man standing." Bruce Dern has a nice supporting role as a corrupt sheriff who waits out the violence to take back an almost deserted town.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a serviceable action movie.  It is too much a copy to become a classic in its own right, but it is certainly entertaining.

 | product/productId: 1558801596 | review/userId: A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ | review/summary: The greatest movie on race relations ever made! | review/text: Do the Right Thing is a classic. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest films on race relatons ever produced. Everyone living in the United States should watch this film, because its message is timeless.<br /><br />  Many people have blasted this movie as being anti-white. Why? Because a white man's pizza shop gets burned to the ground at the end of the film. What's interesting to note is the fact that the people who make such ridiculous claims fail to take into account that the looting and burning of the shop followed the murder of a black man by the NYPD, Sal's non-chalant concern about this, and the fact that Sal pretty much brought the destruction of the shop upon himself with his "so what" attitude after Radio Raheem is killed.<br /><br />  What I like about Do the Right Thing is it forces the viewer to show their true colors. What does the viewer attach more importance to - a white man's money, or a black man's life? The viewer's answer to this question will determine their attitude about this movie.<br /><br />  Far too many people watch this movie with the mentality that they are watching a football game. In other words, the white characters are the "hometown team" and the black and Puerto Rican characters are "the away team." By the end of the film, many viewers are down to cheering and rooting for "their team" to score a victory over "the other team," that the end up missing the bigger picture.<br /><br />  This film really makes a lot of viewers uncomfortable because Spike Lee does not present us with the typical liberal, multicultural baloney that we should just "all hold hands" and pretend to love one another. The reality has now set in that individual and institutional discrimination, along with prejudice, are so entrenched in American life that there is no easy way to undo this damage. The fact that this film pre-dated the L.A. riots by three years makes it all the more powerful.<br /><br />  Ultimately, Do the Right Thing is a reflection and observation of American life, not a fantasy about how things should be in an ideal world. Those who are anti-black, anti-Latino, racist, prejudiced, or otherwise living in a fantasy land or just plain unaware of the magnitude of racial animosity in this country will most certainly condemn Do the Right Thing. Anyone that actually takes the time to move beyond their personal prejudices and examine the subtleties and numerous conflicting and seemingly-contradictory messages of this film will realize its powerful scream for racial understanding and reconciliation.<br /><br />  Easily Spike's best film. Even Roger Ebert has listed Do the Right Thing as one of the 100 most influential movies of all-time. Strongly recommended.
 | product/productId: 6300248100 | review/userId: AOBUUZNV6UUK9 | review/summary: Offbeat sci-fi, with emphasis on character | review/text: Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. give bravura performances as mortal enemies, one human, one saurian, marooned on a desolate planet where their survival depends on overcoming their deep-seated prejudices. Overcome them they do, in fascinating fashion that neatly balances character study and survival epic, with jiggers of theology, humor and action thrown into the mix. At the movie's heart is the evolving friendship of Quaid and Gossett, as their enmity slowly gives way to mutual respect for each other's cultures and beliefs. It's a wondrous thing to watch. Unfortunately, the film's second half - sans Gossett - falters considerably, introducing cardboard villainy, transparent moralizing, routine action and the very painful sight of Quaid teaching Gossett's lizard son how to play football.<p>Quaid is at his cocky best as Davidge, a hot-shot, all-American pilot who wears his machismo on his sleeve until Gossett's spirituality brings out his true humanity. All but unrecognizable underneath Chris Walas's amazing make-up, Gossett is marvelous as the reptilian Drac character, a deeply religious male/female hybrid. The scenes with an ecstatically pregnant Gossett embracing his maternal instincts, much to Quaid's incredulity, are funny and poignant. <p>Not your standard sci-fi fare, and more power to it. Enthusiastically recommended.

 | product/productId: 0800116917 | review/userId: A30OXD42ZFYZLO | review/summary: Magnificent epic of an enigmatic person | review/text: David Lean's epic "Lawrence of Arabia" is one of the best epics filmed for multiple reasons: acting, photography, screenplay, music, direction, the list is endless. Filmed over 2 years is Morrocco and Jordan this brought together a spectacular cast to the tale of Col. T. E. Lawrence. Right from the moment in the start in the desert when the haunting music of Maurice Jarre shows the sunrise, one is mesmerised. It is difficult to produce such movies now. This is a cinematic masterpiece that defies imagination. Most important is the screenplay by Robert Bolt.<br /><br />Initially Lawrence thinks he can accomplish anything, however, he comes to realize the limits of his abilities. When he helps capture Damascus, Gen. Allenby realizes that he has no further use for him. He says "You are promoted Colonel now".<br /><br />Lawrence says "Why?".<br /><br />Prince Faisal says "Take the honor Colonel, be a little kind. Young men make wars and the virtues of war are the virtues of youth, courage and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace and the vices of peace are the vices of old men, mistrust and caution. It must be so."<br /><br />After Lawrence leaves and they start bargaining, at one point Prince Faisal says "Lawrence is a sword with two edges, we are both equally glad to be rid of him, are we not." Gen. Allenby says, "I thought that I was a hard man Sir." To this, Prince Faisal replies, "You are merely a general, I must be a king."<br /><br />Col. Brighton leaves in disgust over this. I do not think of any movie that has such a meaningful repartee. The passion and triumph shown in the movie is outstanding as are the bad parts. I would recommend this movie to any one interested in special movies, learning art of movies. It is not rated the AFI #5 for no reason. Peter O'Toole was outstanding in his first role. A classic in every sense of the word.

 | product/productId: 6301996135 | review/userId: A2H0E6PVDI4X8I | review/summary: View the Civil War the way contemporaries lived it! | review/text: Fifteen hours of videotape that records a scant four-year period of history might at first seem like something to pass up. Don't; you'd be missing one of the great video-viewing experiences around. Where else could  you learn, for example, that General Ulysses S. Grant showed &quot;no more  emotion than last year's bird nest&quot; after he read Robert E. Lee's  letter of surrender? Or that Union troops marching through Georgia ripped  off and bowed so many railroad tracks along the way that Confederates began  calling the familiar sight of twisted metal &quot;Sherman's neckties&quot;  after the general that led the march? Set to nostalgic period music and  refreshed with sideline comments from historical experts, the series is a  visual treat meant to be viewed again and again. It's not only a valuable  and accessible source of historical information, but a truly entertaining  drama that never failes to inspire new insights with each viewing. The test  of any work is its ability to present solid information in a beguiling and  memorable way, and &quot;The Civil War&quot; excels even at its own high  standards. Its open-ended construction is meant to be seen in the  open-ended way that history is lived, so that it's logical for a few hours  to suspend the historical knowledge of the war's outcome that's known to  every school child. Thus, as the film unfolds, it seems realistic to think  the &quot;rebs&quot; could rally and defeat the northern blues after all,  or that Lincoln might stay home that April evening instead of going to see  a play at Ford's Theater. All in all, it's an experience not to be missed.

 | product/productId: 0764005332 | review/userId: A3T69POTR8R107 | review/summary: Out of the Park | review/text: This movie isn't watched so much as lived through.  Gena Rowlands is brilliant as an L.A. housewife knuckling under to schizophrenia, with Peter Falk as her equally befuddled husband.  Cassavetes refuses to play heroes and victims--the movie treats Mabel's madness as an extreme case of the pressures we all face in trying to conform to our social roles.  Falk's unpredictable bouts of love and rage show how often violence polices the line of sanity, yet ultimately he's just as lost as Mabel in trying to figure out the part he's supposed to play.  <p>The story is told through a series of long, seemingly aimless events that unfold mostly in real time--a spaghetti dinner, a trip to the beach, a family party--to track the shifting relations between the characters.  Each one on its own can seem pointless, but the effect by the end is tremendous;  I felt I knew these people better than a lot of my family.  I can't think of a movie outside of Citizen Kane that uses the medium of film so well to tell its story.  Cassavetes and Rowlands knocked this one out of the park.

Tambien, fue impresivo que Amen&aacute;bar creio la composici&oacute;n de musica que fue muy importante en la creaci&oacute;n de este nivel. Pens&oacute; que la pelicula empez&oacute; un poco lento, pero al final, la estructura  de que fue posible para las car&aacute;cteres esta completamente cambiado, y este experiencia es importante para la audiencia. En general, Tesis fue como un misteria de asasino, pero la parte de la victima repongo la parte de la detective. Al final de la pelicula, fue obvioso que Amen&aacute;bar estuv&oacute; enamorado con los detalles que crearon la experiencia para todos las personas. En general, me guste Tesis, que es raro porque es de una g&eacute;nero que usualmente no me gusto.<br /><br />- Tony (on Luke's account)
 | product/productId: 1573624039 | review/userId: AKRRL7358VJIS | review/summary: Frightening...but...true...somehow... | review/text: I first heard of Gregg Araki through the trailer for &quot;Nowhere.&quot; I saw that movie and thought it one of the gutsiest films I'd seen in a  long time. Then I heard that it was the third in a trilogy of teen angst  apocalyptic anarchy, including &quot;Totally F**ked Up,&quot; and this  film. &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; is even more difficult to watch than  &quot;Nowhere&quot; was. Araki's penchant for using obviously half-assed  teen language that is so outdated it's beyond humorous...which is the best  reason to laugh at it, is only amplified by the extensive cussing. Also  extensive in this movie is the sex and violence, both of which are VERY  abundant. From a quicki-mart owner's head getting blown off (sorry for the  spoiler) to stabbings to getting beat up by gang members (played by the  members of the late industrial band Skinny Puppy) to the shocking and  saddening climax, this movie is a bloodfest that could rival the &quot;Evil  Dead&quot; movies. The sex...well, in Rose McGowan's first starring role,  this movie makes it clear that she has to be a screwed up person to begin  with just to be involved in a movie like this (and to think...with this as  her first movie, some people were surprised that she would become Mrs.  Marilyn Manson). Her depravity as a person goes beyond being a slut, but  even to a sense of self-denial and hypocrisy, a condition that is worsened  by the fact that everybody else in the movie thinks that she's someone they  once knew who left them...and in return they must kill her. Was she? Maybe.  It's beside the point, and yes this movie DOES have a point. And it's a  little more than conveying the idea that this world we live in is a literal  hell, as is told by the 666 and Hell references that are so blatant and  obvious, they also add to the humor. However, this movie has no laughs. Not  that that's a bad thing, but it has almost no moments of light-heartedness.  It grabs you by the head and gouges your eyes from beginning to end. The  unrated director's cut is apparently a far superior version (I'm sorry to  say I haven't seen it yet, but I hear that the climax is extended and the  brutality of it is not only deafeningly saddening but also essential to the  subtle point this film tries to make). A great soundtrack also adds to the  gloom and eeriness of the movie. Not for the weak-stomached, and certainly  not a movie for those who don't know how to think (you don't know who you  are but I'll give you a hint...you liked Armageddon and thought it was the  most beautiful and emotional film ever made...). Even for people who do  like to think...this movie is painful. It will hurt. Physically, it will  make you sick, but if you can deal with its over-the-top dialogue, it's  bland acting, it's unnecessary but still compelling sex and gore, and the  fact that it reveals an underside to this world that is blackened by our  own demons, then you just enjoy that twisting sensation in your gut when  you finally feel like you're ready to puke by the end of the film.

Carole Lombard is still one of the greatest actresses ever and if you've never seen her before, now is a good time to go ahead and find out what you've been missing.  The movie itself stands on its own without the star power.  It is well-written and witty.  Robert Montgomery is also fantastic.  If you don't really like many Hitchcock films, don't worry, this one is different.

It *is* an excellent movie for all the resons already noted but on todays stereo,high-fidelity systems (mine), I  notice a lot of tape hiss and high end noise that is quite distracting and  at times almost intolerable.  If you play this tape on speakers with good  reproduction in the high ranges you might find the high frequency whine a  bit hard to take.

I once worked for a gaffer who excused himself from the set by mentioning that he had to go to the sandbox and take a Universal. I then discovered from another crew member that the bus would take different crews to the backlot and stop in between sets so they could walk the rest of the way. The astute collector will know that this contempt seeps into retail where they are just as likely to anger as please the consumer. Perhaps that is why the English can watch this film in scope and you cannot. Be persistant in looking for the European product. dvd beaver. com is a VERY GOOD place to search.
 | product/productId: 0780625854 | review/userId: ADRW96ZDK894X | review/summary: Despite negative reviews, Striptease is a great movie | review/text: Demi Moore was excellent in this film. She is not only a beautiful woman, not just body wise, but within her soul.<br />Demi plays a divorced woman, Erin Grant, who looses custody of her beloved daughter to a scumbag of an ex husband. (This is typical justice in the real world. I relate to this movie because it happened to me and I haven't seen my daughter for 13 years.)<br />Anyway, she had a respectful job at the FBI and looses it because of her husband's criminal activities. Then she looses her daughter because she doesn't have a job.<br />So she becomes an exotic dancer to make the money needed to get her daughter back. It's excellent money for her but she doesn't really like what she's doing. However, she performs with class and dignity, regardless of the stigmitism of &quot;strippers.&quot; Ving Rhames, who is the bouncer Shad, has a soft spot in his heart for Erin. Anyone calling her a &quot;stripper&quot; will find a drill gun spinning at their forehead. She is a &quot;dancer.&quot;<br />Burt Reynolds plays the corrupt, twisted Congressman who finds his &quot;angel&quot; (Erin) and persues her. There is legal snaffu's, funny scenes, and Erin is witty and courages because she will not give up on her daughter. Her love for her daughter is deep and real.<br />Demi learned to dance like an exotic dancer for this film and after just having a baby at the time, she looks great.<br />This film you will either like it or not. If you're looking for a lot of skin, T&amp;A, this is not what you want. This film does have class. Demi's brief nudity in the film just proves that she is a confident woman and a great actress.

You Talk To Me... | review/text: Later to be known as a man of dignity, honesty, and fragility, Mel Gibson is known to most ignorant men as a pansy. However, for the select few who can actually bare the man, we always come to our senses to watch this film whenever time is on our side. Once Mel was known for his survival instincts, keen street smarts, and his signature everyman-for-himself attitude. This movie proves that in all aspects...<br /><br />Max Rockatansky is the protoganist on the verge of collapse. His wife and child were murdered by a group of bikers, only later to be almost fully exacted on by Max single handedly.. He now runs life on the highway with his faithful canine and the champion Pursuit Special Interceptor. Suffering from disillusionment, society seems all to desperate in his eyes...just as desperate as he is to stay alive in search of pertroleum. What you will find throughout the movie from here will only bring you driving plot sequences and entertaining scenes that will keep you watching the whole way through. All the action never gets old, many instance come up that will make you have that tad laugh you want to let out, and the ending chase will leave you wanting to explore scene selection the next time around.<br /><br />The best way to sit through this is with an open mind, so be aware of things that you might not see in a normal action film. Now since this is science fiction, there will be many skeptics upon stupidity and pointless aspects to this film, but hopefully you will understand the true concept about this movie and everything that fills it.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a exemplary masterpiece in every way possible for a film. This is Mel the way he wanted to be portrayed in the beginning...raw, tough, and in your face. He makes sure you understand what kind of hell he has been through, and this movie is a veteran example of such reality. I highly recommend adding this to the library which you have forged, as it only reigns as an essential piece in film history. If you already purchased it before, give it another round. Only classics are worthy of so...
 | product/productId: 0767810171 | review/userId: A2S6KKPGH2NQU | review/summary: Long, but worthwhile | review/text: Surprisingly enough, Brad Pitt didn't compromise this film!  I always question the use of big name actors in important movies.  Yes, I consider this to be an important movie.  Every time I watch it, I am overcome with  the beauty and tragedy of Tibet, the wondrous mystery of Tibetan Buddhism  and the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.  It's a true account, which  chronicles the experiences of Heinrich Harrer.  His transformation  parallels that of the Tibetans who regularly make the pilgrimage to Lhasa  for spiritual purification.  This DVD has no extras at all, but worth the  price for the film alone.  The transfer to digital is good.  It would've  been nice to have some information on the true account of Harrer as well as  info on the Chinese occupation of Tibet.  You might also wish to check out  the soundtrack featuring Yo-Yo Ma.

Timothy Spall &amp; Billy Connolly<br />provide great comic relief (&quot;I'm Posh Fruit&quot;) from the<br />sombre sections of this classic story. I loved it from<br />start to finish, and was so taken by it that I'm ordering<br />the soundtrack as a keepsake. I'm also obsessed with<br />&quot;The Flame Still Burns&quot;, a classic ballad which I have<br />been playing to death on my VCR. It's a touching song, and<br />adds to the moving and triumphant ending. Please get this<br />cast together one more time for a sequel, as there's some definite magic happening here.

Coble (Richard Farnsworth) who offered him to ease up at his place for a while... Tom accepted, but he said I'd to earn my keep...<br /><br />Seeing Horn with great ability with a rifle, and after speaking with the Association, John asks him to eliminate the rustlers who have completely wiped out their herd profits not to mention what the buzzards and the predators have done to their cash crops...<br /><br />But after one incident has disturbed the Association in town, and the rustling has stopped, they determined to get rid of Horn forgetting he was only doing what they hired him to do... Mc Queen plays well the Indian tracker "scared to death of lobster, the man of the West "afraid to lose his freedom and not be able to get back up in those hills again."<br /><br />Linda Evans is appealing as the school teacher from Hawaii who saw a man of the Old West trying to live in the New...<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth is the loyal friend John C. Coble who was quite sure that Tom never killed that kid... John advices him not to try to break out of the jail... He knows he can do it, but it's just admitting his guilt if he tries...<br /><br />Billy Green Bush is the U.S. Marshal Joe Belle who asks the newspaperman to sit behind the door and write lying down what he hears real good...<br /><br />Slims Pickens is the old Sheriff Sam Creed who arrested Tom...<br /><br />With a legendary hero, great photography and good direction "Tom Horn" is very good Western to watch...
 | product/productId: 6300214052 | review/userId: A1MKEG6UVIVB5V | review/summary: Not too bad, but showing its age | review/text: Compared to modern Fantasy and effects it doesn't really hold up so well, but for its time it was very impressive, and on certain levels a new standard.<p>The story is a little bit linear, and I'm not so sure the characters are very charismatic - the accents are kind of annoying, too - but despite the minimal humour, and the classic feel, the acting is far from bad or even as melodramatic as you might expect.<p>It's a good ride.<p>The score, however, is utterly awful. Cacophonic, badly paced, and uninspiring. It doesn't even have a theme.<p>As for the DVD itself, it has the absolute bare minimum - the film and some choices for sound quality. The menu isn't even animated or with music. This is a great shame, it deserves better.

You know that satire is great when it is rocketing along that close to the truth!

 | product/productId: 6301966740 | review/userId: A30UTOXO99BSKG | review/summary: Boring | review/text: This is one of the only movies that I will turn off before it's finished. Although I did have to watch the rest of it so I can say I watched Casablanca. <p>This movie is horrible! It is so boring and unoriginal that I can't stand it. The only good thing about it is the cast. Bogie is the man of course and Ingrid Bergman makes the screen shine with her beauty and talent. But that's it.<p>How is it boring? Because all they do is talk. The only moment I felt enthralled is where Rick flashbacked to Paris and the end. That's it. The rest is a bunch of talking and ordering the African-American around. Now I know it's old but it's not based on the Civil War. It's during World War II. A lot of people, including blacks, got killed so the studios could make this awfulness.<p>How is it unoriginal? It's about a love triangle. You take away the locale and the nazis and that's all it is. Besides, there's absolutely no chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. They looked more uncomfortable than in love. A lot of professional reviewers praise it because they base it around World War II. Of course they did, the movie was made in 1943. <p>According to the AFI this movie is #2 in the best movies of all time. It's right above The Godfather. Say it isn't so say it isn't so.<p>Final words: If this movie is so great then could anybody tell me the director or the screenwriter?

 | product/productId: 0780621654 | review/userId: A2C3X01L03NG9P | review/summary: Deconstructing Harry Rocks | review/text: This movie is simply the best self-parody ever done.  In the poetry world I'm sometimes sneered at because self-parody is considered self-indulgent, usually by pinchy-faced critic types as opposed to the people who don't mind seeing the whole truth, whether that truth allows someone to be egotistical or not.  So, predictably, critics were a bit snarly about Woody's new level of self-indulgence.  In fact, the first time I saw the movie, I too was a bit upset about it, (and I'm not a literary snob).<br /><br />In fact, after all these years, it turns out the film is raw talent and genius with some of the funniest romantic-horror-comedy scenes of all time.  The highlights of the movie are quite simply two scenes.  The first is the argument between Woody and Judy Davis, a real high-energy scene, complete with harrowing action.  But the apex of the film is the final conflict between Kirstie Alley and Woody, which is just the best couples' argument scene that has ever been produced.  Woody is good in the scene in that he keeps interjecting jokes in what should be a deathly serious thing, and he plays the "calm abuser," a type toward whom I have much bitterness, brilliantly.  But it is Kirstie Alley who gives simply the best performance of her life in this scene.  She is both frighteningly angry, in a way that is completely believable and yet she does hilarious things.<br /><br />Of course he ongoing dialogue with his Jewish roots is very evident, and the conflict he has with his Judaic Fundamentalist sister and her similarly-oriented husband is classic.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a brief appearance that is sheer slapstick.  She really is very funny and very sexy in this movie.  Woody often disproves the critics, who by the way need to be disproved and mocked at every turn, when he takes actors that have been pigeon-holed by the critics and proves that they are great actors in their own right and, in fact, very convincing in diverse roles.  (I'm a left-winger, but so are most of the movie critics.  However, my form of leftiness doesn't include this "debunking" of people's careers or art.  There is just some cynical urge in the critics to box people in, and it comes off practically like an edict or some authoritarian impulse.  Sorry about the political note, but I sometimes have to take my fellow liberals to task, since conservatives do not have a corner on the market of pettiness.)<br /><br />And, of course, we can never forget how wonderful it is when Woody takes a trip to Hell itself, which, it turns out, is ruled over by Bill Crystal, for subconscious reasons the movie itself will make clear).  You never saw a Satan more comfortable in his own skin.  The dialogue is funny and perverse, and a bit x-rated, so I can't quote much of it here, but it's some solid locker-room filth delivered by two men in suits looking quite classy as they do it.  All of the contrasts here are excellent.<br /><br />And, throughout the movie, as one who loves Woody would insist, the Psychoanalytic and Atheistic world view as they play out in their journeys through the subconscious and the conscious mind are sheer mythological and philosophical wonders.  (I myself and not an Atheist, and am in fact very religious, but I really believes every belief system, including those differing from mine, have something great to give.  In truth, Woody would agree with me in saying, whether or not there's a God, most people can't be trusted with religion, as the current wars display all too well.  So I'm not at all hostile to Atheists, since they are usually more trustworthy than their spiritual counterparts, and I'm secure in my own spiritual feelings, so none of this threatens me.)<br /><br />Now, if you are a person whose life is held together, and about to break apart, but not for a thin thread of romantic and philosophical constructs, this movie might not be for you.  The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't strong enough to handle the truth of it.  (This is very much a "you can't handle the truth" movie.)  I have beliefs, but I'm not addicted to them.  However, if you need to be right most of the time and you NEED to have your beliefs validated, you may want to skip this film.  It's for folks who can be hit with the whole truth of their romantic and philosophical condition.

Close Encounters, about a man (Dreyfuss) and a few others all have a calling to meet at Devil's Mountain where they will meet  extra-terrestrials. Some of the best scenes full of intesity made whole  with John Williams awesome score.

 | product/productId: 6301376757 | review/userId: AJKWF4W7QD4NS | review/summary: Lame sequel to Cronenberg's classic | review/text: David Cronenberg's The Fly turned out to be better than the original, thanks to the director's unique vision, an eerie performance from star Jeff Goldblum, and superb Oscar winning makeup effects from Chris Walas.  The Fly II finds Walas returning, this time in the director's chair, picking up where the first film left off.  Goldblum's mutant offspring (Eric Stoltz) is raised by the company he once worked for, who have every kind of exploitive intention in store for him.  What results is a pointless and predictable revenge yarn that lacks every bit of personality and poignancy that Cronenberg managed to lace into the first film.  While The Fly II boasts some decent looking gore and effects, the overall result is a dud that not only fails to live up to the first film, it doesn't even come close.  All in all, if you've never seen The Fly II, you haven't really missed much.
 | product/productId: 0790741164 | review/userId: A34KBX6VF28QYN | review/summary: One of Stone's few worthwhile efforts | review/text: Forget whether this film is factually accurate--it's not.  But that's not the point.  As sheer cinema, it's a tour-de-force, one of the few times Stone's over-the-top antics make the film rather than derail it.  Though  Costner is only serviceable in the lead as Garrison, where this film  flourishes are in the bits: Tommy Lee Jones as an effeminate conspirator,  John Candy at his best as an FBI insider and man of great appitites, Kevin  Bacon gritty and real as a convict contacted by Garrison.  It's easily  Stone's best film--his two Viet Nam films are powerful, but this one has  the scope and sweep of an epic, and for once he lives up to his ambitions.  As a true detester of Oliver Stone's later work, I can honestly reccomend  this as not just palatable but powerful.
 | product/productId: 0780622642 | review/userId: A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D | review/summary: a nifty little space adventure | review/text: Having never saw the Lost In Space series, I will only review the movie itself. Now some of you have bashed this flick simply because you didn't think it measured up to the tv series. For all I know, that could be correct. Still, I enjoyed this movie regardless of having not seen the series. The only con I found with Lost In Space is that even though it was slightly over two hours, it seemed a bit rushed. Even putting back some of the deleted scenes would not have added much more to the story although the deleted scenes were somewhat good. On the pro side, the casting was great and the special features are overall interesting. I am usually not a fan of space movies with the exception of star wars though I really liked Lost In Space.
 | product/productId: 0790741628 | review/userId: A1XX5797TIZT5Q | review/summary: Awe-inspiring action sequences; preposterous writing. | review/text: Jet Li and Chris Rock are the reasons to watch this one -- Li because it's about time Martin Riggs gets his behind whipped by a truly formidable villain (the weakest point of all the Lethal Weapon movies -- Gary  Busey!?), and Rock because Joe Pesci was becoming much more of a  multi-million-dollar liability in the series than an asset.  Pesci's brand  of humour can work sometimes, but the character was so thinly written from  the get-go that they should have just dispensed with him.<p>The scripting  is preposterous -- the flame-thrower-wielding maniac in the beginning had  nothing to do with the rest of the movie; the dialoguing is like excuse  after excuse for jokes, most of them bordering on the offensive; Riggs'  character is rendered absolutely despicable.  So it's up to Rene Russo and  Danny Glover to put some humanity into the story and they succeed well.  Li, also, finds that subtle place in his character that makes him a much  more well rounded villain (eg. his love for his brother) than those  amphibian, stereotypical South Africans in Lethal Weapon 2.<p>I must admit,  I'm annoyed at the fact that Chinese characters are STILL inexorably tied  to kung fu.  Even after the John Woo revolution, the Chinese character in a  mostly American cast is still pitted into the chop-socky category.  That  said, Richard Donner's approach to the martial-arts sequences is  superlative; by avoiding the badly conceived, rhythmically inept  slow-motions, posing, unnecessary montages and ultra-close shots of most  Chinese martial-arts movies, Donner achieves a kineticism that was  breathtaking when seen on a big screen.  I saw this movie twice at the  theater just for the action sequences and trust me, this is one definite  case where video can't measure up.  Li's extremely mobile actions are  awesome.<p>So that means the car chases, burning houses and gunfights pale  all the way in comparison.  As much money was thrown into that car crashing  through the building, ten seconds of Wah Sang Ku pounding both Riggs and  Murtaugh into submission completely override the big spectacles.  And when  Riggs finally defeats Wah, it's great resolution for a good human conflict.

 | product/productId: 6301826558 | review/userId: A1ZLFCUF4XX7RZ | review/summary: Worth a Watch | review/text: This movie is long. I'll say it...it's like Titanic long, but without all the glitz and glam of Titanic. Well it did have the glitz and glam, but not in the same manner. Griffth's work is the answer to the critics who critized his most well known worth Birth of a Nation.<br /><br />Intolerance follows four different story lines. A modern one concerning "do-gooders" and the poor, the fall of Babylon, The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and the trial and crucifixtion of Jesus. All of these based somehow on the theme of intolerance for something, most notably that of religious differences.<br /><br />This movie is not for those who need a lot of plot to keep them interested. It's fairly straightforward. And since it's a silent silm many may be bored by it. But it's something to give a change. It's a classic that shouldn't be missed.
 | product/productId: 0790734508 | review/userId: A3T1YHEP25SGDK | review/summary: Neat story | review/text: Personally, I find that the first three minutes of the movie are the absolute best.  It's a brief view of Mr. Seagal running an Aikido class and demonstrating technique.  Since he is wearing a hakama, his footwork is hard to follow (which is the purpose), and the motions are extreme, but it is interesting to watch.  I'd even be willing to bet that the freestyle sparring is neither choreographed or the blows pulled.  For that bit alone, the movie is worth purchasing.<p>There are a few problems that might cause the purist to cringe.  The goal of Aikido is to execute technique with a minimum of movement, and it is not intended to be as agressive as it is in this movie.<p>Nevertheless, this is a very good movie.  Enough plot to fill the space between the fight scenes, and the fight scenes are very well executed.  As has been pointed out, you realy need to watch the scenes in slow motion to appreciate them, but that's half the fun.<p>Steven Seagal tends to try much too hard, and there are moments where it's just a bit cheesy, but you can't have everything.<p>This is a must view for someone who appreciates the &quot;art&quot; in martial arts (the technique is amazing!), and is probably pretty decent (though a bit slow) for the action movie fan.
 | product/productId: 140496102X | review/userId: AUFG3RMKQR4UX | review/summary: Guy movie. | review/text: This movie has all of the elements you'd look for in a guy movie: guns, explosions, sex, and shoddy acting. They start delivering on the sex scenes with 2 of them in the first 10 minutes or so. Bam!<br /><br />The reason it only gets 3/5 stars here is because for a guy movie, the body count is kinda low. Instead of piling the bodies high, they waste scenes on trying to get Van Damme to act. Hello? In one scene they try to show Van Damme crying and turning to alcohol, but instead he looks like he's having a glass of scotch after work with too much eye drops in his eyes. Come on, we want violence not melodrama!<br /><br />All in all, this movie won't waste too much of your time if you're into guy movies. That is if you can get over the fact that they kill off the chick of the movie early so there's less time to oogle over her body and if you can laugh off the acting scenes.<br /><br />PS - The best guy movie of all time has to be Dolph Lundgren's Army of One. They actually try to keep track of how many bullets a gun can hold in that movie and you'll laugh at how they compensate for it. Please watch that movie if you haven't. You won't be dissapointed!!

 | product/productId: 0790739909 | review/userId: A3V96P0M0EB451 | review/summary: A little Predictable, Great Performances | review/text: For you Meg Ryan fans [10 years ago], this may well be the best performance of her career. She is utterly believable as a young heart surgeon who falls in love with a haunting Nicholas Cage [her angel]. I found Cage's performance strong [because he is a strong actor], but in this case, not strong enough to maintain my suspension of disbelief. The script is a little heavy-handed on the metaphors, like Ryan's "heart surgeon" role, and the fact that angels must literally "fall" out of their protective, celestial perches in order to experience what humans feel when they "fall in love." I dunno. Maybe thse are minor points, but they seemed a tad hokey to me. What happens as we follow the foibles of Nick's coming to terms with human frailty - as well as the conclusion - are also a little predictable. I did, however, love Dennis Franz's performance as a fallen angel who learned to accept - and adapt to - his new role as a human being. He brought some much-needed levity to a script that might have otherwise found itself drowning in self-indulgence. In the end, this is a film about true love, and about how much we're willing to give - or let go of - in order to feel it in the first place. In a world where everything is over-analyzed, and caution is at an all-time high, it was a welcomed relief to visit this over-the-top look at romantic love one last time...before we forget it ever existed. Maybe that's why I gave it 4 stars.

This film is made with the same eye to beauty and presentation of character, but captures the tale of St. Francis of Assisi.  There may be some overdramatization to make a point here or there, but then I don't mind that sort of thing - it's artistic freedom.  One of my favorite scenes, is when the group of Franciscan brothers finally gets to have an audience with the Pope - and the Pope acknowledges &quot;Christ in the distressing disguise&quot; of Francis and his group of brothers, it speaks volumes.  See this movie if you have respect for the message.

Pictures presents "MARKED WOMAN" (1937) (96 min/B&W) -- Starring Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell, Eduardo Ciannelli, Rosalind Marquis, Mayo Methot & Jane Bryan, .<br /><br />Directed by Lloyd Bacon<br /><br />Lloyd Bacon directed this tough, fast-paced film about "hostesses" in a nightclub run by a ruthless gangster. Star Bette Davis shines in the leading role, but it's cobra-like Eduardo Ciannelli who steals the film as the crime kingpin. A sleek, urbane actor, Ciannelli was a doctor before turning to the stage. He made his film debut in the previous year's Winterset, and would go along to become a top movie villain for the next several decades. Ciannelli had about him an air of refined cruelty that made him compelling to watch. Unlike Davis, his is a name that never became well-known.<br /><br />Dedicated to realism, Bette Davis left the set when the makeup department outfitted her with dainty bandages for the hospital scene following the physical attack on her character by mobsters. She drove to her own doctor and instructed him to bandage her as he would a badly beaten woman. Returning to the set, she declared, "You shoot me this way, or not at all!" They did.<br /><br />This film also shows wonderful examples of the Art Deco style in the Club Intime nightclub sequences. The design is lustrous. Hollywood Deco always signified glamor, modernity, and sexual liberation.<br /><br />This film also has an up-and-coming actor by the name of Humphrey Bogart along with his soon-to-be-real-life-wife Mayo Methot. Get a load of some of the other female names in the cast: Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell and Rosalind Marquis - all "marked" women!<br /><br />Special footnote -- Screenwriters Rossen and Finkel capitalized on a sensational trial reported by the "New York Times" between May 14 and June 22, 1936 according to film historian Charles Eckert. Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey was the prosecutor and Charles "Lucky Luciano" Lucania his target. Dewey went on to become New York governor and a two-time Presidential candidate while Luciano went on to organize Dannemora, the New York dock workers, and the international drug trade. The women whose testimony led to a conviction left the House of Detention and were sent to Dewey's offices in the Woolworth Building, where they received sums ranging between $150 and $175 dollars, barely a half week's wages that they earned as prostitutes. Then, according to Eckert they "disappeared, as they do in the film, into the fog."<br /><br />BIOS:<br />1.

 | product/productId: 0790741164 | review/userId: A3DHDS5HDFE6IX | review/summary: Oliver Stone World (forget logic and hold on)... | review/text: First, as a movie, you can't do better than JFK.  In fact, it would be hard to do better than Stone, period, in terms of movie making.  This guy is a fantastic director (and writer) - imaginative, original, courageous and much more.  This movie will absolutely keep you riveted to your seat. In many ways, like Stone's "The Doors" (a five star effort), it will blow your mind.  Stone's creativity, compared to the crap spewing out of Hollywood these days, is truly remarkable.<br /><br />So, why two stars?  The allegations this movie makes (and don't be fooled by Stone's baloney that the movie gives multiple points of view - Stone's point of view, not subtly delivered, is that the U.S. government whacked Kennedy) are so absurd, when compared to the actual facts, as to be comical.  The completely unfunny part is that many in our illiterate society - particularly the young - will take this crap as real history.  The threads of coincidences, etc. which Stone, through nut-case Garrison's character (well played, as usual, by Costner), tries to morph into facts are so blatantly ridiculous (if you have taken any time at all to read about or study the Kennedy assassination) that your mind may be blown in this respect, also.<br /><br />To hear Stone tell it at the time of the movie's promotion, Kennedy was killed and the Warren commission illegally and under-handedly threw out the lone gunman as fact and no one in positions of responsibility ever challenged that conclusion (an assertion Dan Rather did a great job of exposing as false in an interview with Stone).  It would be easy, but probably boring, to point out all of the absurdities in this film - for they are legion.  So, my advice would be to 1) enjoy the flick, but give it no more credence as history than you would The Wizard of Oz; 2) if you are interested in the Kennedy Assassination, refer to the plethora of great books, documentaries, etc., which are available from all points of view; last, as with all things Oliver Stone, consider the source.  He is a genius in many ways, but not one who has ever been a champion of truth...oh, and that Joe Pesci - HOLY COW!

A very sad and  shocking film.  Not something I encourage anyone suffering from depression  to watch.
 | product/productId: 0783228023 | review/userId: A3OT8HDV03UV0U | review/summary: Worst Tremors Movie Ever. | review/text: Lets see, where to begin on this disasterpiece? For one thing, the acting on this film is pretty bad and seems to reek of B-Movieness. Actually, now that I think of it, everything in this movie is pretty average, except there is one thing in this movie that is extremely stupid/annoying: The way the tremors look, act, and move. <p>In case any of you that are reading this haven't seen the movie, I will now describe what the tremors look like. They are short, stupid-looking creatures that looked like they couldn't hurt anyone, let alone kill them. This movie was completely unrealistic and I just couldn't see why anyone would be afraid of those things. It's the film-makers job to make the creatures look scary, but they've obviously failed in that aspect. I know this really doesn't sound like very big of a deal, but the whole movie was just ruined for me because of this.
 | product/productId: 1415757690 | review/userId: A2U9VFA27PIN5C | review/summary: Lousy drama, worse history | review/text: This is historical drama at its worst.  There is no sense whatever of being carried to another era or sharing the lives of  its people.  I felt like I was watching a drawn-out costume show, interrupted by exaggerated violence that created no tension and exaggerated sex that had no erotic appeal.<br /><br />But what's really disturbing about this series is the screenwriter's total lack of respect for his historical material.  Far from being "relatively free of historical inaccuracies" the series is rife with them.  Entire episodes are based on incidents that never happened.  Worse, many of them never would have happened; they contradict what is known about the characters or the era; sometimes they contradict simple common sense.<br /><br />A guest leaves the table at a VIP dinner for the Pope and Curia, and goes unchallenged into the private quarters of his host to do lethal mischief?  That is no more credible in a Cardinal's palace in 1492 than  it would be in the White House today.<br /><br />Young highborn ladies travel on horseback and alone across two hundred miles of bandit-ridden countryside and the Appennine Mountains?  The producers of Hollywood's silliiest westerns would shudder at the notion<br /><br />Those are just two examples of implausible events that never happened.  There are many others.  In the very worst, we  see Cesare abduct Giovanni Sforza, beat him brutally, and take him to the Vatican dressed only in a night shirt.  There, in the presence of two whores, a big bed, and the entire Curia, Sforza is taunted about his virility--or lack of it--while all the Cardinals titter and jeer.  This ugly travesty never happened, either.  Sforza's long quarrel with the pope about his marriage took place entirely through letters.  As for the Cardinals, corrupt though many of them were, they were generally astute.  They were unlikely to risk scandal for the petty satisfaction of humiliating an insignificant count.<br /><br />I have been reading about Borgias and their era for many years.  Their story--their real story--is rich with drama and complexity.  What a pity it all went to waste here.  But there is one good film around that you can watch: "The Conclave."  It's set much earlier, when Rodrigo Borgia was just a young cardinal, laying the groundwork for his rise to Papacy and power.  "The Conclave" is an intelligent, engrossing movie, and it tells us more about the Renaissance and its church in two hours than we get from this whole sleazy series.

 | product/productId: 0800187784 | review/userId: A21EGMJ3E78LPV | review/summary: You will love this even if you are not a Jim Carrey fan! | review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a Jim Carrey fan. I don't particularly care for his brand of physical, over the top comedy antics. Well this is nothing like his other films and that's a good thing! If he did more roles like this instead of more of the same, he would have an even bigger fan base. Here, Carrey plays it cool. And I'm a big fan of subtlety in comedy. Watching him drive the good-natured Matthew Broderick crazy is just plain hilarious. This has a sort of Fatal Attraction feel to it. The cable guy wants Steven (Broderick) to be his best friend. And he'll go to any lengths to prove it. But after Steven tells the Cable guy that he no long has room for another friend, Carrey begins to sabatoge Steven's life in retaliation. Sound familiar? I guess that is where the darkness people refer to comes through in this film. I enjoy dark comedies like this and Death Becomes Her, also recommended. I feel when you have brilliant writing and the right comedic timing, the comedy will shine through without all the physical craziness that some comedians force onto us. I guess it depends on your taste. However I highly recommend this even if Jim Carrey is not your cup of tea. I would even say it's his most intelligent comedic performance to date.

 | product/productId: 0792839072 | review/userId: A1WZZGWET3EHFH | review/summary: What Is Wrong With This Good Movie... | review/text: HOW THE WEST WAS WON is a good movie; however, it and the 2008 blu-ray restoration have some big mistakes.  First of all, let me say that the blu-ray version is very beautiful, with rich color. I particularly like the smilebox presentation on disk two.  A problem in the restoration does spoil the early part of the movie, in the section dealing with the river.  The scenes where the Prescott family and the Scottish family are camped along the river at night were filmed as day for night.  When the movie came out in 1962, these scenes were darkened to appear as night.  So when Linus (James Stewart) comes along, the families wonder about what kind of man travels the river after dark.  On the blu-ray it looks like broad daylight.  Otherwise I find no fault with the blu-ray.  It's great!<br /><br />The movie has a fine script with many of the best actors of the times.  But there are a bunch of geographic goofs:  1. The rapids depicted early in the movie looks nothing like the historical Falls of the Ohio River.  The real Ohio River ran through deciduous forests.  The rapids in the movie is obviously on a river in the mountainous west, with coniferous forests.  2. Not even 100 miles out from Independence, Missouri, the wagon train is passing in front of towering Rocky Mountain peaks.  We know this because Gregory Peck's character arrives after 100 miles.  The Rockies are hundreds of miles from Independence.  3. The wagon train heads out with the leaves turning autumn colors.  It would have left in spring, to make it across the mountains by winter.  4. The colored leaves are seen throughout the trip to California.  Such a wagon train could never cover that distance in that short of time.<br /><br />I do wish film-makers would be a little more careful with details.  (I also know that there were considerations of budget and time.)  The truth is I like this movie a lot and can't praise the musical score and songs enough.  Buy it with the second smilebox disc. ( Just once I had to sound-off about the inaccuracies in a movie.  I'm sorry if that is too much info for you.  I do not want to spoil your enjoyment of this classic film.)
 | product/productId: 6301863186 | review/userId: A2CZPM110DW516 | review/summary: Obscure dramatic gem | review/text: Despite its inclusion in the Fox Film Noir series, "House of Strangers" has more in common with "King Lear" than it does with "Panic in the Streets" and "The Street With No Name." Still, it flirts with noir through casting. Stars Edward G. Robinson and Richard Conte have frequently walked the dark, rain-swept streets of that anxiety plagued genre which generally focused on society's underclass.<br /><br />"House of Strangers" tells the story of an Italian immigrant barber who finds his fortune in banking. But success comes with a heavy price as his tyrannical ways alienate his sons, three of whom let their father twist in the wind as his kingdom crumbles due to mismanagement and unethical practices.<br /><br />Although Philip Yorden receives sole credit for the screenplay, film historian Foster Hirsch, who provides an insightful and entertaining commentary, insists the script was primarily the work of the director, Joseph L. Manckiewicz. The acidic tone of much of the dialogue does suggest it written by the man who brought us "All About Eve" the next year.<br /><br />The cast is superb with Robinson brilliant as always, but it is Luther Adler as Joe, the eldest son and the most conniving, who offers the standout performance. His scene with Conte in the restaurant is a textbook example of fine acting. Susan Hayward is good, too, but her part is rather superfluous, added for box-office purposes rather than dramatic necessity.<br /><br />"House of Strangers" is fairly obscure these days, and is probably best-known for having inspired the 1954 western "Broken Lance" with Spencer Tracy and Richard Widmark, but it stands tall on its own merits and is well worth seeking out.<br /><br />Brian W.

 | product/productId: 6302353785 | review/userId: AK61LQI92GTCH | review/summary: On to Kansas | review/text: DARK COMMAND is a good, old-fashioned western.  The movie takes places in Kansas on the eve of the Civil War. Not just anywhere in Kansas, either - the movie's set in bloody Lawrence, the hotbed of guerilla activity during that war.  Perhaps no guerilla leader was more notorious than Kansas's William Quantrill, the school teacher turned raider who fought against the Union until his death in 1865.<br /><br /> Although DARK COMMAND is a work of fiction, it doesn't try hard to hide its sources.  DARK COMMAND is adapted from a novel by the talented and prolific W.R. Burnett, whose Hollywood credits include either the based-on novel and/or screenplay for such action classics as Little Caesar, the original Scarface, The Asphalt Jungle, High Sierra, and dozens of others. John Wayne plays a roustabout Texan named Bob Seton who's traveling through with dentist/barber/sidekick Andrew `Doc' Grunch (George `Gabby' Hayes.)  While in Lawrence Seton meets and immediately falls for pretty Miss Mary McCloud (Claire Trevor), local belle and daughter of the president of the town's bank, a Virginian (where you were from counted a lot in Kansas prior to the Civil War.)  Seton's competitor for the affections of pretty Miss McCloud, and a bit later for the office of town marshal, is schoolteacher William Cantrell (Walter Pidgeon.)  That the real life Quantrill was also a Lawrence, Kansas schoolteacher is, well, probably something more than a coincidence.<br /><br /> Of course, Cantrell loses both the election and the heart, if not the hand, of Miss McCloud to Seton.  As filtered through the Hollywood lense that's more than enough justification to embark on a campaign of pillage and murder, which Pidgeon's Cantrell proceeds to do with a certain amount of righteous dignity.  Raoul Walsh, whose last movie before this one was the classic gangster movie `The Roaring Twenties,' directed DARK COMMAND with his usual relentless flair.  Also in 1939, the young John Wayne had finally broken through to the a-list after playing the Ringo Kid in John Ford's `Stagecoach.'  `Stagecoach' co-star Clair Trevor is billed above Wayne on the credits, but this is very much a John Wayne movie.  The two principals, director Walsh and star Wayne, were at strong points in their careers and this movie did nothing to derail them.  Wayne wasn't an icon yet but he had the moves down - he's shy and awkward around the women folk, toweringly commanding with men.  One of the text extras on the film quotes Walsh's observation that `Wayne had learned to walk and talk' by the time DARK COMMAND was filmed, and if you watch some of Wayne's earlier b-movies you'd have to agree with Walsh's shrewd assessment.<br /><br />  I've seen a handful of Raoul Walsh movies in the past year and enjoy them tremendously.  Pidgeon's Cantrell seems to be a prototypical Walsh heavy - he's erudite, urbane and refined, and, we suspect, substantially smarter than the hero. If Hollywood was about to fall in love with Freud Walsh definitely wasn't leading the charge.  Even the presence of a maternal housekeeper, played in American Gothic style by Marjorie Main, doesn't do anything to explain what makes Cantrell tick. Cantrell is a Walsh villain, which means he's evil because he's evil and that's that. We'll have to understand him through action rather than introspection.  In lesser hands this would leave us with a scowling, carpet-chewing bad guy.  But DARK VICTORY'S script is tight, Walsh was a master at action dramas, and Pidgeon is too good an actor - he never drops Cantrell's courtly faade, and he's all the more a menace for it.<br /><br /> Fans of old b-westerns will get a kick out of seeing a (very) young Roy Rogers and `Gabby' Hayes together in the same movie before they became cinema trail mates.  Hayes' slightly mush-mouthed `gol-durn-it' routine can be grating, but Walsh uses him as a relatively subtle comic foil to good effect.  If you've watched a few too many b-westerns chances are you'll find oddly touching the one scene between Hayes and Rogers.  Rogers is in mortal danger and Hayes is his best and only hope.  Hayes drops the Gabby act and lets George take over.  It's a nice way for Walsh, through Hayes, to turn the tension up a notch and let us know that this is important.  It's been my experience that Walsh's movies are filled with such nice touches, and it's one reason why I like them so much.  DARK COMMAND has more than enough going for it to rate a strong recommendation.  The script is good, performances are uniformly strong, and Walsh is a master at keeping things moving.  It's a great early John Wayne western.
 | product/productId: 0790742799 | review/userId: A298JV8C4ADLU7 | review/summary: Falls short | review/text: Robert Duvall is great. There is no questioning his supremacy among all actors. One of his greatest roles was that of a looney marine in Apocalypse Now. I don't know if Apocalyse precedes or follows the great Santini. However, if it precedes, then Santini is a poor exploitation of a great character for Duvall.<br /><br />This movie portrays an extremely demanding and unforgiving father of four kids. It shows Duvall's character's strengths of leadership and drive are his greatest weaknesses when transferred to his private family life.<br /><br />The movie is very sentimental and has moments of trajedy and requisite humor. However, it fails to really push Duvall's character to the greatness he deserves. In the end, it is just a bland sort of family movie.

Like all Python films, it is a wonderfully confusing mixture of slap-dash storylines, the obscene and ridiculous, and a satiric view of Celtic history. This film, however, is unique in its "simply silly" approach to one of Britain's most loved myths... Killer rabbits, three-headed knights, naked ladies, snobbish Frenchmen, and flying cows abound, so sit back and enjoy the show!

The characters are real, not the over used, over sexed ones you can find in a lot of &quot;gay&quot; movies out there.  The setting is  wonderful, completely in keeping with the feel of the movie, and the  situations of the characters.  Gabe is cute, vulnerable, and obviously  working on achieving his dreams in life.  Mark is Confident, macho, and  really cute.  They get to meet, and during the course of trying to have a  one night stand, with constant interuptions, find the beginnings of a  relationship.  The supporting cast is great too.  Tori Spelling is actually  good in her roll as the &quot;gay man's best friend&quot;  LOL you have to  love that.  The character of Perry is just incredibly funny, witty, and  ultimately loveable.  If you don't own this movie, buy it, rent it, get it  any way you can, it is worth it.

Finally, I got sick of AMC cutting out the good parts and decided to get it on DVD. Probably one of the best choices of my young life. Any kid nowadays would say that the dogfight scenes are tacky but I truly believe that this movie, for the time of its creation and for many years that followed, is a top dog in flight special effects.

Not only was it an excellent documentary, it gave many viewers their first and, probably, last look at stars from the silent era; most of whom would be dead within the next 5 years. Also since saving film wasn't much a concern back then, many of the clips used have probably deteriorated to dust. My only complaint is that this excellent 11+ hours series isn't released on DVD in America, as yet, and I still have to lug out 13 individual VHS tapes to watch it instead of 2 or 3 DVDs in a compact case.

Jake(Belushi) has just gotten out of jail and re-united himself with brother and bandmate Elwood.(Akroyd) The Blues Brothers have just found out the orphanage they grew up is going to be sold and they have to stop that from happening. They have a couple of days notice to get $5,000 or it'll be gone. But how can they fail, They're on a mission from God.<p>This movie has some of the greatest chemistry between actors that you will ever see. Jim Belushi and Dan Akroyd are great. Words don't give these guys the credit they deserve though. They stared, wrote, and actually played and sung the music in this. There characters are some of the most memorable in film history and both are pop cultre icons. Their easily the greatest SNL skit to ever go to the big screen and this is a must for anyone who considers themself a fan of either actor.<p>The music is awesome in this movie. You have to love a movie that has Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, and Ray Charles in it. The Blues Brothers and their band are awesome as well. This movie could be considered a musical and it has some of the best ever.<p>This one is also one of the first movies to have hit stars in short cameos in it. Carrie Fisher, Steven Spielberg, Frank Oz, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, John Candy, and Ray Charles all have good ones and there are pleanty of other guys you'll recognize.<p>I don't think I've ever seen more crashes in one movie either. If you love high speed crashes and chases you'll like Blue's Brothers just for it.<p>Blues Brothers is one of the all time greats. Director John Landis(Three Amigos, Trading Places, Animal House) called this the greatest action musical chase explosion movie you will ever see. He's totally right and I garuntee you will love this one.

There is a lot of punnish humor but also a lot of anachronistic dialogue that is just situationally hilarious.<br /><br />Paul LeMat stars as the leader of the Born Losers, a biker gang of good guys with three missions in life: Find the evil, Destroy the evil, and find a really great lite beer.  He has visions because of a steel plate in his head and he is being studied (sort of) by one of his fellow bikers who is from MIT. <p>The bad guys are a biker gang of women who wear what appear to be leather jackets with the letters WOW written on the back (later we find out that the jackets reverse to be bowling league jackets). WOW stand for Women of the Wolf.  They are kidnapping babies for fun and profit, says one of the girls but the truth goes much deeper.  The leader of the WOW, played by Eileen Davidson, was abandoned by her parents afer a shoot out with the law and was subsequently raised by wolves.  So now she has plans to create a new generation of fearless independent women by kidnapping baby girls and taking them to the woods to be raised by wolves.<p>It is up to the Born Losers to take on this bevy of beautiful biker babes and put an end to the kidnapping.  Davidson will have to choose between the attraction she feels for LeMat and the culmination of her feminist ideals.  <p>Absolutely fantastic but probably is not appropriate for kids.

 | product/productId: 0783226128 | review/userId: A11KNUBP56G6AL | review/summary: Disco Fun for the Whole Family | review/text: I'd been looking forward to watching this one.  I've had the DVD for several years and finally decided to break open the packaging and watch this tonight.  What a major disappointment.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be a movie about Al Capone or Chicago gangsters or something of that nature.  It's not.<br /><br />This movie has no likable characters, a bad story, and some pretty bad acting.  There is nothing redeeming or uplifting about the story. It is a total downer.  I kept waiting for some turn to come in the story or an arc of change in the characters.  Everyone becomes worse and worse during the course of the movie and in the end I turned off the DVD player and was glad the whole mess was over.<br /><br />I'll give the film some credit for some decent sets and production quality.  The film does fairly well at capturing the disco era and all of the excess that went with it.  And speaking of excess, there is way too much profanity in the movie.  I don't care if these types of characters would really talk like this.  In the final analysis, I don't see that there was any good point to telling the story of these characters.<br /><br />Not recommended for watching other than by students of bad film or masochists who want to subject themselves to nearly 3 hours of emptiness.

Most entertaining. Reminded me, in some measure, of "Waking Ned Devine". The cast gives believeable performances, and the story line, although a bit weak in a couple spots, is very rewarding.<br />My wife and a good friend were in adjacent seats on the flight, and had watched another film while I was watching the 'Girls'. I convinced them to watch it on the second showing (9 hour flight yeilds about three viewings), and they were equally impressed. I'll definitely see it again in the theater when it's released state-side.

The script is intelligent; the acting is powerful; and it is a movie that will keep the audience captivated from the opening scene until the end.

There is no clear "good" since every character is intensely human with some significant flaw, and this makes the characters very believable and sympathetic. The performances of both Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe are amazing.

 | product/productId: 6301768809 | review/userId: A2QPASVROZIK2L | review/summary: Important untapped themes | review/text: First Blood is an extremely important film but perhaps not for the chest-thuming nationalism that somewhat spoils its compelling climax. First Blood taps more importantly into themes of homosexuality and masculinity. The nature of Rambo's relationship with the old war "buddy" he seeks in Small town, USA is never fully explained, his rage at not finding him never entirely clarified. The viewer is invited to empathise with Rambo's cause, not because we can relate to him, but because he is rhe ideal attractive yet vulnerable male. Given that the target audience of this film is young men it is entirely reasonable to suggest that an exploration of homosexuality is a deliberate sub-theme. For those in doubt it is worth considering Stallone himself in this and the subsequent Rambo films. Long haired and muscles bulging, it is not hard to imagine what the decidedly phallic weapon he holds at the ready represents.<p>I whole-heartedly recommend this film to evey young man, it is one of our favourites at my local YMCA.

 | product/productId: 0783221088 | review/userId: A1DTCJV6KOMJOA | review/summary: Don't look down! | review/text: Vertigo is one of those rare films that runs on atmosphere. This film pushes you into a  a world of murder, lust, lies and a dream like state so real It's as if everything around you disappears and you're in a dream and not watching a flick at all. Stewart is Ferguson a cop who is afraid of heights after he watches his partner fall to his death while they chase a suspect, after this he retires and then is hired to watch over a friends sucidial wife (Novak) who he comforts after she throws herself into San Fransico bay! When the wife dies suddenly Stewart is left heartbroken and finds a new love who reminds him of th egirl he lost. The film pushes into overdrive but in a subdued and calm manner. Vertigo is pure cinema at it's most daunting and magical. Not for a second do you believe anything that is happening on the screen. If someone was to tell you this story over the phone you would probably laugh till you wet your pants-but have you ever had dreams where the same person vists you over and over again or a case of deja-vu, then this film isn't so funny anymore. Hitchcock takes these elements of illusion and throws them at us one after another for the entire film. Stewart is brilliant the drawl in his voice underlies his paranoia perfectly and Novak shines as an uneven object of desire. Novak gives the best performance of her carreer. Vertigo leaves you spun and weak after each viewing because to watch it, a little bit of you has to belive what is going on and you have to just let go and fall into the film's premise and if you are afraid to do so-well then you have the flick Vertigo my friend!

Is it the old Godzilla, no not by far. I love old Godzilla I really do, but I'm no crazed fanatic. I have all of the movies featuring Godzilla, and they are all fun, some not so fun like SOn of Godzilla-really bad film. BUt they all have they're charm.  I know that Godzilla fans hate the remake or revision. But lets be realistic, if your going to remake Godzilla go all out and make it different. The special effects were great, still are as well as they hold up even today. While I consider Gojira a full blown classic, I'm glad they went somewhere different with it here in the remake. There are some good laughs and cool action scenes. The overall story is weak but not bad, and the new look for Godzilla and lets be realistic fits, while I wanted a full blown fire breathing monster, at least we got a giant monster. I wish this would get a sequel. But I know most people will hate me for giving this a good review but yknow so what.  A man in a rubber suit doesn't cut it anymore people, I'm sorry. Thats probably why I don't like any of the modern films that came after this remake. They are just sad movies.

Glen Campbell gave a good, and underrated, performance as a likeable Texas Ranger.  Contrary to the critics, who ganged up on Campbell,  I thought that Kim Darby was the weak link in the cast.  Robert Duvall was  outstanding, as well as the rest of the supporting cast.  The soundtrack  was excellent and the scenery was fantastic.  Virtually every line that  John Wayne delivered in the film was gripping.  I have never seen an actor  since who could hold an audience's attention the way he did in True Grit.  An interesting anecdote: Henry Hathaway was pretty rough with Glen Campbell  and berated him mercilessly during one of the scenes.  Robert Duvall blew a  fuse and told Hathaway that if he treated any member of the cast that way  again, he would walk off the set.<p>Sit back and enjoy the show.

Watson, two are narrated by Holmes himself, and two others are written in the third person --- The first two stories, short novels, appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887 and Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890 --- The character grew tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891; further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared almost right up to Conan Doyle's death in 1930 --- The stories cover a period from around 1878 up to 1903, with a final case in 1914. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)<br /><br />Rathbone is most widely recognized for his starring role as Sherlock Holmes in fourteen movies between 1939 and 1946, all of which co-starred Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson --- The first two films, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (both 1939) were set in the late-Victorian times of the original stories --- Both of these were made by Twentieth Century Fox, later installments, made at Universal Studios, beginning with Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942), were set in contemporary times, and some had World War II-related plots --- Rathbone and Bruce also reprised their film roles in a radio series, The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939 - 1946) --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)<br /><br />Legend Films can restore, colorize and release many of the classic earliest black and white films --- a patented coloring and remastering process makes each film picture perfect plus more vivd than ever --- no one can resist collecting every title that Legend Films releases.<br /><br />Hats off and thanks to Barry B.

 | product/productId: 6300182916 | review/userId: A353XEWQABCLUZ | review/summary: Incredible Clarity | review/text: I literally just finished watching the HD DVD on my external XBOX 360 HD DVD drive.  Before watching the movie, I was skeptical that a movie filmed in 1982 could actually come anywhere near the clarity of HD.  Much to my surprise, the clarity and definition was just amazing.  You'll notice details in the film that you hadn't seen before.  You can actually see tiny detals on everyones' shirts, sweaters, hair, etc.  I just turned the disc over and am watching the plain DVD version; it isn't nearly as clear as the HD DVD version.<br /><br />The only minor complaint that I have about the disc is that the "Extras" feature (i.e. the interviews of the actors talking about the film) are on the DVD side.  However, you can fortunately listen to the director & producer's commentary on the HD DVD side.  It's definitely worth listening to because their commentary offers interesting insight for each scene.<br /><br />I highly recommend this classic!  When you see it in HD, it's like seeing it for the first time!
 | product/productId: 6301967992 | review/userId: A1HE70Y2W2W31X | review/summary: Not a bad spoof | review/text: This film was a great spoof, with pretty good performances by Jack McGowran and Roman Polanski, and a very good music score that really pulls you into the mood of the piece. I had previously seen a shorter edited version which was confusing and not well paced, so it's refreshing to see the movie in a longer form and more complete. This movie has to have one of the all-time funniest gay vampires. A must-see just for that.
 | product/productId: 5559458260 | review/userId: A3UU7QX6HXKU7S | review/summary: Days of Being Wild (1991) | review/text: Out of all of his films, Wai, in a personal statement is said to look back upon Days of Being Wild with great affection and it is easy to see why. Those familair to the sytle and thematics of Wai will instantly be able to relish the familair trappings, yet with new issues such as; abuse, denial, and maternal relationships. The dreamy, atmospheric cinematography of Christopher Doyle slowly seduces the senses and the heart. While the aural, operatic storyline frequently borders on tragedy, the film contains Wai's irresistible underpinning of irony and spiritedness. Overall, Days of Being Wild features beautiful, reminicient scoring, breaktaking scenery, ferocious performances and strong production values. My rating 4.5/5! A very human story of love (or not) and redemption.<br />Downside: The Kino Video restoration of the film is satisfactory and nothing more. While films such as Happy Together and Chungking Express have garnered second and even third restorations, you'd think Days of Being Wild would be an equally, if not more substatial priority to those with material rights.
 | product/productId: 6301327802 | review/userId: A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z | review/summary: One reason the sun set on Dmytryk | review/text: Those who enjoyed Robert Ryan's 1949 boxing noir THE SET-UP (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RE6I">VHS</a>) (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EZ6">DVD</a>) can also see him box a sumo wrestler (!) in RKO's BEHIND THE RISING SUN, when he as Lefty O'Doyle takes on a martial arts expert (Mazurki).<br /><br />That's however just an amusing sideshow highlight in Edward Dmytryk's generally grim picture, which concerns a Japanese father and son who by story's end adopt views in opposition to how each originally felt. The younger man (Neal) returns to his homeland from a U.S. college in an Americanized state that leaves him estranged from Japanese tradition. He eventually turns rabidly militaristic and commits atrocities in China, while his once pro-Japan father (Naish) becomes so appalled by their country's barbaric expansionism, he expresses dissent in the time-honored Japanese manner.<br /><br />A heavy-handed script shows our then-enemy in the worst possible light: infanticide, pederasty and intentional drug addiction of Chinese children are all offered as evidence of Nipponese infamy. Japanese civilians are depicted as victims of their fascistic government, with hapless (and innocent) Hirohito hamstrung by a powerful military junta.<br /><br />Conversely, since the USSR was then our ally, a Soviet character named Boris (Givot) is presented in a positive light by director Dmytryk, who was at that time a Communist Party member. By decade's end this political affiliation got him blackballed by the HUAC as one of the original infamous 'Hollywood Ten.' Dmytryk was actually imprisoned several months for refusing to testify before the House committee. He eventually did name names, which made him a pariah in many Hollywood circles.<br /><br />As of 10/09, "Rising Sun" was not available on DVD.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.2) - Behind the Rising Sun (1943) - Margo/Tom Neal/J.

 | product/productId: 6300251020 | review/userId: A1534MBU6VJXYN | review/summary: "Long Ago, It Must Be..." | review/text: Despite occuring over 20 years ago, the legendary Central Park reunion concert between Paul Simon & Art Garfunkel still is one of the greatest events in rock history. To see these two old friends together for the first time in over 10 years holds value, and though they have reunited sporadically since then (most recently in 2003 for a tour that yielded the excellent live dvd and album "Old Friends Live On Stage"), nothing can top this event.<br /><br />Kicking off with an exhuberant performance of "Mrs. Robinson", this is Art and Paul at the top of their game. Though you can still see a bit of tension brewing between them (you can feel Art's tension when he exits the stage so that Paul can sing one of his many solo hits), but they manage to overcome tensions and put on a flawless show (which includes hits such as "Homeward Bound", "America", "Bridge Over Troubled Water", "The Boxer" (with an added verse) and "Old Friends/Bookends")<br /><br />Of course, the dvd isn't exactly flawless. Yes, the sound and picture quality is great. But, there are some problems. First of all, why is it that several songs are grouped together into one chapter? Granted, there are no performances really worth skipping over, but still, it is a bit annoying. Secondly, Paul's John Lennon tribute "The Late Great Johnny Ace" is not listed in the track list, yet it is included on the dvd. I also would've liked to have seen some bonus features added.<br /><br />That being said, this does nothing to take away from the show, which is still a great show after all these years.

 | product/productId: 6302168465 | review/userId: A3013MHSQS4Y8Y | review/summary: An edition worthy of a classic! | review/text: Two conditions are necessary if you want to see this film: 1) You have to be a sci-fi fan, or at least have an open mind to the genre. 2) You certainly cannot be one of those people who mock at dated special effects. If you meet these two requirements, then you certainly can enjoy &quot;The Day the Earth stood still&quot;, one of the capital films made during the Cold War paranoia. <p>If you're reading this, then you must be a fan already. But just in case you never heard about it before, this is one of those genre pieces everyone knows, even if they've never seen it. It's about an alien visitor who comes to Washington DC in the early 1950's. He brings a message of peace and a warning to the human world, but he gets shot right away when he sets foot off his ship. After escaping the hospital, the alien (Klatuu), who looks exactly like a human, must pass himself as a citizen and stop his robot, Gort, from destroying the Earth in retaliation. In a time of paranoia, tense conflicts and stubborn world leaders (what else is new?), the message that Klatuu brings is, however, difficult to swallow: the only answer to mankind's rule of violence is totalitarism. <p>The debate about the message continues even today. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, it is as powerful today as it was during the Cold War. Unlike the giant insects movies of the 40's or the silly space serials, &quot;The Day...&quot; tried to make a serious statment using sci-fi form. It certainly suceeded, because the movie became a cult classic right away, and the robot Gort was to be one the most recognizable movie icons of all time. The special effects look silly today, but an intelligent script knows how to extract the juice out of the story and avoid the campy elements (mainly because there is very little action). <p>Now, Fox surely took a sweet time into releasing the film on DVD, but the edition is well worth the wait. The transfer is nearly spotless, both in video quality and sound. Apart from the special editions of &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, I don't think I've ever seen a B&amp;W restoration this good. I would like to know, however, why it's not in Widescreen format. Maybe somebody else can answer that for me. And the extras surely are great. The disc includes an audio commentary by director Robert Wise, as well a 1 hour documentary about the film and the cult that followed. This documentary includes interviews with the director and producer, among others (and what the heck is Joe Dante doing there anyway?). There's also tons of picture images, including the original posters. One more thing: among the trailers featured on the B-side there was the one from &quot;5 million years BC&quot; (you know, the cavemen movie starring Raquel Welch). Does that mean they're going to release that little jewel on DVD as well? I can't wait!<p>So, to end this extremely long review, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; is getting the DVD edition it deserves. It even has Spanish subtitles. Let's hope other cult classics are as lucky as this one.

 | product/productId: 0783225857 | review/userId: A29IYGR7SNPRIV | review/summary: An American Classic | review/text: Certain films define not only their particular genre, but also their country. For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of &quot;differentness&quot; that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.
 | product/productId: 1889710008 | review/userId: AJXCJBQABJDFM | review/summary: A Must See | review/text: This video radically changed my faith.<br /><br />I spent my entire childhood thinking that Jesus was a boring, meek and weak God.  This movie took the exact words of the NIV and transformed them into a new outlook on the "humanness" of Jesus.  People didn't follow a boring sulking man (who strangely didn't blink in Jesus of Nazareth), but a charasmatic and joyful man.  People gravitated to him.  They flocked from all over because joy radiated from him.<br /><br />I have followed Bruce's career since this film and God used him in a Huge way.<br /><br />If you are tired of movies that portray Jesus as meek, weak and boring, this movie is for you!
 | product/productId: 1415757690 | review/userId: AJ6EMEU3WIP2E | review/summary: Jeremy does not save it | review/text: What's wrong with the British? Why am I sure that, had HBO done the Borgias, they'd have wrung it not only for raunch, but also for torment, suspense, vivid emotion. There is something so anodyne about British story-telling. Correct but cold. Precise but clunky. Give me slick any day. Manipulate me emotionally: make me larf, make me cry, glue me to the sceen. US TV achieves this consistently in recent series. The British just don't get it.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons is delicious of course and, at some moments, almost saves the show. As he is anointed pope he staggers into the arms of his son, overcome by what he mistakenly believes might be his own holiness. He is mannered, but in subtle, riveting ways.<br /><br />I bought series one because of Jeremy. Sadly, even he can't tempt me to finish it.

 | product/productId: 0767802594 | review/userId: A32W0EJ0652QOB | review/summary: Denzel dazzles! Do Much Ado | review/text: There is an opening scene where the prince (Denzel Washington) and his men arrive at the villa of Leonardo. They bathe and then walk in unison to the main house. Washington's walk is worth the price of admission. (And I'm an  heterosexual guy!) Washington's role requires that he give the most  textured performance of the players - and he does it magnificently. The  entire cast shines, except for Mr. Reeves. (I would be interested in  knowing Branagh's true take on Keanu's performance.) Emma Thompson has that  old screen magic that literally causes viewers to fall in love with  her(both Hepburns had it, as did Diana Sands, Barbara Stanwyck and Dana  Wynter, to name a few. I think Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts are  contenders, as well.). Ken Branagh is effortlessly brilliant. Keaton was  somewhat over the top. Although the story is a bit contrived (it's  Shakespeare, after all), it is a wonderfully entertaining and accessible  vehicle for Shakespeare fans and detractors.

So Being that this was a very low budget film and there's no way that they could have used real sharks or made a dummy shark (like Jaws), where did they get the footage...looking at all the end credits didn't tell me so that makes me think...did they actually get it themselves  or did they steal the footage from like NOVA or National Geographic? Hmmm..i'll never know!<p>WAIT...THERE'S A SHARK ATTACK 2?!!?
 | product/productId: 6300263681 | review/userId: A1F1FOR46702YF | review/summary: A Monstrous Good Time | review/text: The world's most famous movie monsters meet their match in the 1987 comedy-horror film "Monster Squad". Count Dracula unites the Wolf Man, the Mummy, the Creature of the Black Lagoon and the Frankenstein Monster in search of a powerful magical talisman that will allow the forces of evil the power to rule the world. Now, the only ones that could save all humanity from Dracula's ghoulish plan for global domination are a tree house club of young teenage monster enthusiasts. "Monster Squad" is an amusing mix of horror and comedy in tradition of such 1980s film favorites like "Ghostbusters", "Gremlins" and "The Lost Boys". The 87-minute movie delivers plenty of thrills and laughs. Award-winning make-up artist Stan Winston's monster designs are similar to the ones from the classic monster movies but are well updated for a more striking appearance. Since its theatrical release, "Monster Squad" has earned a solid cult following and fans have anxiously awaited its release on DVD.<br /><br />Fans of the 1987 comedy-horror film favorite will rejoice for the release of "Monster Squad" 20th Anniversary Edition. The 1987 comedy-horror film is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-disc DVD has a good video transfer with little noticeable grain. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is rather enjoyable. Among special features, the 2-disc DVD includes two audio commentaries with director/writer Dekker and cast members, the extended "Monster Squad Forever" featurette, eight deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, TV spots, storyboards and a short interview with actor Tom Noonan (Frankenstein Monster). Overall, "Monster Squad" 20th Anniversary Edition gets a "B".

The sountrack by Alan Silvestri is also very good (I have it).<br />I can't decide which is better-the book or the film.  I know that Jodie played Ellie Arroway geniusly.  I think Carl would be proud of it.<br />  By the way, did anyone realize the two &quot;C's&quot; in the film.  One was in Ellie's father's hand.  And the other was at the very end when Ellie sifted rocky soil in her palm.  I think &quot;C&quot; symbolizes &quot;Carl&quot;.  They tried to be conspicuous because one &quot;C&quot; is backwards or reversed (forget which).  I love this movie.
 | product/productId: 6301773551 | review/userId: A3CRIJNXXDCMFH | review/summary: Finally!!!!!! | review/text: In 1977 I saw episode 4 in a Pittsburgh movie theatre.  I left that theatre a changed boy.  I waited patiently for each sequel.  I was blown away by each one.  Now let's fast forward to 2004.  I spent my money on the 2004 box trilogy.  George Lucas, you are the anti-christ!  It is agreed that Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were disasters BUT at least he could have released the original theatrical versions of episodes 4,5, and 6.  Thank God I own an original copy of "The Warriors" BUT that is another story.  Since I'm on the topic, will someone please pay Mike Tyson to punch Walter Hill in the mouth, as hard as he can.  Anyway, in 2004, Lucas seemed hell bent on estranging the true Star Wars fan.  Fast Forward to September 2006.  While holding out hope that I would find the Criterion version of John Woo's "Hard Boiled," I found the original theatrical release of Episodes 4, 5, and 6.  Phew!!!  I'm still hearbroken over that whole "The Warriors" director's cut disaster.  I'm sorry, I went off on a tangent, didn't I?  I'm going to buy a second set of these Star Wars DVD's simply because Lucas can't be trusted.  Remember Jar Jar Binks?  How about Greedo shooting first?  'Nuff said.  True fans know the deal.  We all got burned when we bought the 2004 release of the trilogy.  Why George? Why?  The original theatrical DVD's does not absolve poor Lucas of his prior sins (Episodes 1-3, and the 2004 DVD trilogy disaster) BUT it will shut me up for awhile.  These releases have also taught me something.  "Director's Cut's" usually suck.  Let us all pray that Abel Ferrara does not have a "Director's cut" of "King of New York."

 | product/productId: 1569382514 | review/userId: A2AKWF6P1HPKUA | review/summary: Spirited interpretation of Gilbert and Sullivan | review/text: Like so many opera films, this presentation is a film of a stage show.  Rather than ignore this, the producers include behind the scenes vignettes of the company and stage hands.  These brief interludes provided amusing transitions between parts of the opera and were not overdone.  The playful spirit is in keeping with the irreverant tone of sirs G&amp;S.<p>It is too common these days for producers to try to upgrade the words of G&amp;S operas, both for political correctness and to make them more topical.  This production is no exception.  Unfortunately, the new references often are so topical that they have no relevancy a few years later.  For example, the wonderful line, &quot;When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte, as any child can tell, the House of Peers, throughout the war, did nothing in particular, and did it very well!&quot; is replaced by some drivel about the mostly forgotten Falkland war.  At least the changes are documented in the DVD version.<p>There are no captions or sub-titles available on this DVD, which is unfortunate.  Nevertheless, this is a wonderful version of Iolanthe.  The players are in good voice and they clearly understand that this is comic opera.  This Canadian company ranks among the most refreshing modern interpreters of Gilbert and Sullivan.

Well filmed.  Good acting.  And good special effects for 1997.  And for those of you who don't remember,  this movie is based on bubble gum trading cards of the '60's, so it's kind of nostalgic too.  Enjoy.
 | product/productId: 156938195X | review/userId: A1BXA3SM3AJOKL | review/summary: Not a really faithful adaptation | review/text: This review is geared toward considering the episode in terms of its quality as an adaptation of the original story, rather than as an independent entity, so if that doesn't interest you, shoo. :)<p>The basic plot and some of the major subplots of the original novel have been adapted faithfully, but in moving the story several years forward in time (several years after Heribert's abbacy ended), several of the characters have been replaced or altered greatly.<p>_A Morbid Taste for Bones_ is the first book in the series, which follows a linear chronology (i.e., each book happens some time after its predecessor, so the characters change accordingly, and the events in the world around them track what actually happened in history). Revising the scripts to change the order of the stories consequently has inherent problems.<p>Rather than Abbot Heribert, Radulfus is in charge, which results in a different interpretation of several other characters.  Unlike Radulfus, who's in his prime, Heribert at this point was elderly, and nearing the end of his tenure. Prior Robert took it for granted that he would be the next abbot, while others had motives to try to displace Robert so they could step into the abbot's shoes later. Removing those possible motives changes the balance of the story.<p>The visionary Columbanus has been reinterpreted. His visionary fits here are bluntly interpreted as near-insanity, rather than offering any possible interpretation as a calculated pose. When Brother Cadfael considers that Columbanus might be trying to build a reputation for holiness as a lever into the abbot's mitre, he questions Columbanus openly about it rather than entertaining it as a private theory early on. Consequently, the stage for Columbanus' last vigil and vision in Gwytherin is arranged somewhat differently than in the original.<p>Brother John, Cadfael's first assistant, who entered the order after his girl dumped him, has been eliminated, along with the subplot concerning his vocation; instead, we have Brother Oswin, as usual in the adaptations (who is portrayed as an amalgam of Brother Mark and the original Oswin, without the wisdom of the former or the heartiness of the latter).<p>For the supporting players: the Welsh villagers look far more downtrodden than I would have expected (everyone except Rhysiart and his daughter is wearing an institutional shade of blue); the Shrewsbury villagers don't get that treatment when the monks are on their home turf. Cadfael's role as translator is eliminated, as everyone magically speaks English (OK, I'll grant that one for the sake of translation to film.) But to give him an equivalent role as a buffer between the monks and the villagers, Cadfael is presented as the only member of the monastic party with common sense - and if you think Prior Robert was politically naive in the books, think again. In fact, Robert's original problem was that he was *too* worldly-wise, and underestimated local affection for Saint Winifred.

Nestor Alemandros does excellent camera work as always, Mimsy Farmer is a complete babe, and there's lots of cool scenes of them getting high. And actually, it's a pretty accurate  morality tale.. I don't think it falls for the 'reefer madness' stuff, but  it shows a starkly realistic descent into the nightmare of heroin  addiction. I'm suprised the movie is not given a fair shake.. during the  wild, get-high times of the late '60s, this is a great little film that  shows the downside of drug culture without being preachy. And it's gorgeous  to look at.
 | product/productId: 5554819621 | review/userId: A96K1ZGW56S2I | review/summary: A Father's Love. | review/text: FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a romantic comedy in a different vein. Most movies of that type are about a boy meeting a girl and the two falling in love. That happens in FATHER OF THE BRIDE. However, the movie isn't about the romantic love between a couple; it's about a father's love for his daughter.<p>It is true that the cast didn't have very difficult roles. Nevertheless, Steve Martin, Dianne Keaton, Kimberly Williams and the rest of the cast do a remarkable job, making the Banks family seem like real people you know instead of just some characters on a screen. Also, Martin Short, as the wedding coordinator, Franc, steals every scene he is in.<p>I enjoyed watching this film alot. I laughed quite often and, even though I'm a bachelor, found myself crying during some scenes. The film is a family picture and for any man who has a daughter, ranks up with FIELD OF DREAMS for bringing a tear to your eye. It's a nice movie to bring the past into prespective, remind one of what really is important in life, and thank God for the blessings you have.

I have looked for it on DVD and other than an old video copy(in the big clam shell case that was Warner bros. trademark in the 80's) and found that very little was cut from the version I saw as a kid.<br /><br />  Brynner is the whole show here,so if you like him that's a plus for the movie,but the kiss of death for those who don't like him. Here he's a warrior in the 2012 world of New York. The planet has faced plauge and neglect til nothing will grow. One group of people,with Max von Sydow as it's leader has found some seeds that are growing and want to get away from the city to grow them. Enter Brynner, as a warrior hired to take them there and protect them from the bad gangs.<br /><br />  Not very "ultimate" but still good fun for the over 35 crowd and those who love Yul Brynner!

They really made me think about how amazing the creatures on this planet are and how amazing our God really is. To me it takes WAY more faith to believe in evolution than it does creationism. When you step back and look at the amazing complexities and how they are all intertwined and work together harmonically you can't help but realize that there has to be a God and this all could not have just happened from some primordial soup or some big bang. It's statistically impossible. I don't care how long of time it may have supposedly taken.<br /><br />For the evolutionists, where did the particles come from the big bang? Where did the first atom come from that makes up any kind of particle, and to take it a step further, to think that this whole complex eco system that we live on called Earth along with the entire order of the universe all evolved from 1 small atom molecule that suddenly decided to explode and make new atoms. You can't take absolutely nothing, no matter or particles or anything and then suddenly have something unless it was created. Believing in evolution is absurd. Our God is an awesome God.

 | product/productId: 6301969863 | review/userId: A17Z13IWLRGI1M | review/summary: He knows women so well; too bad they hate him. | review/text: Woody Allen probably knew that Interiors would be panned by his most loyal fans, his most ardent critics (Pauline Kael), and even the always honorable motion picture industry.  How he managed to ignore what might have been  insurmountable difficulties for another is a feat of no small measure; how  he managed to craft this dramatic gem is &quot;an impossibility  commensurate with two like snowflakes&quot; (from Woody's Getting Even).  Mary Beth Hurt shines as Joey, a passionate but ambivalent  actress-photographer-copywriter, who cannot transcend her pressing  responsibility as daughter to a delusional and depressed woman, Eve  (Geraldine Page).  She has two sisters (a theme to be further explored in  Allen's later Hannah and her Sisters), one of whom is fairly irrelevant and  indifferent to her life (the only underdeveloped character in the film),  the TV actress Flynn.  The other sister Renata (Diane Keaton) is a highly  successful poet who has distanced herself from Joey while she deals with  complex emotional issues stemming from an abusive, alcoholic husband  (Richard Jordan) and her own artistic &quot;paralysis.&quot;  Woody weaves  the stories together with dignity and grace, and Gordon Willis' superlative  cinematography pays homage to Bergman's Sven Nyqvist (the beachwalking  scene could be Persona in color) while infusing his own creative vision  into each shot.  Woody's comic flair is nonpareil, and his unique  cinematic concept is timeless and powerful.  With Interiors, Woody  indelibly makes his mark as one of the finest dramatists of the 20th  century as well.

We happen to see the quite young daughter of a really good couple friend of my parents, right before we went into the theater to watch this. My parents had no idea how bad this one was. My mother, just out of the blue, invited the young lady to join us. Brian DePalma has always been one of my favorite directors, and I only had a slight hint of how bad/good this would be. Well, I don't need to tell you the rest of the story, if you've seen this movie. My parents apologized profusely to her parents, later after we watched it. AND I WAS LOVING IT!!!<br /><br />I bought this on laser disc right when it came out, and recently, about 1 year ago, bought the DVD. I really like the movie, one of my favorite Brian DePalma flicks. I'll tell you some of my favorite parts.<br /><br />1) The music playing, when Scully, the Craig Wasson character, gets excused from his movie scene, and is driving home to spend some unexpected quality time with his live in girlfriend. That is probably the greatest sound track music I've ever heard, by Pino Donaggio.<br /><br />2) The edit cuts, between the viewing of the murder, through the eyeglass, that Scully is looking through, and the real life view, in the living room of the murder victim. I still remember the sound effects and cries of pain by the actress.<br /><br />3) The twirling effect of the cameras, when Scully and the female are kissing no the beach (no, it didn't make me dizzy, like other reviewers.)<br /><br />4) The "B" Acting of Melanie Griffith. You' d think she really was a porn star, the way she's acting.<br /><br />5) The police detective that interviews Scully. That guy was so creepy. Reminds me of the actor Fred Gwynne. Very entertaining.<br /><br />Rent or buy this movie, and you shall not be disappointed.<br /><br />Little known fact about this movie: Brian DePalma interviewed a real porn star (can't think of her name off hand, but she was extremely popular at the time this movie was being made) and rejected her based on her poor acting skills. Too bad they don't include her trial tapes in the DVD extras That would be bangin'!!! There is a book I own, called Double DePalma, which gives in great details the behind the scenes of this movie. I just checked, and it is also available for as little as $2.11. I highly recommend that item too.<br /><br />Dubyac99 aka MC White said: Ch-ch-ch-check it out!!! EDIT: I'm the 69th reviewer of this version? Coincidence? I think not!<br /><br />EDIT: 10/27/2006<br />Well, I have finally received my copy of this DVD from Columbia House, and let me tell you, it was really great!  I would have liked some commentaries from Brian De Palma, but I notice he does not like to do commentaries, for the most part.<br /><br />Still, this movie is one of my all time favorites by him.<br /><br />Totally Excellent!!!

It is horror with vampires, but it is more of the vampire hunter-type like Blade.  Blade is the best of  those movies.  I don't like some of the special effects as much as in  Blade, but it does have some pretty awesome scenes.  Valek, the master  vampire, is a very cool vampire.  In the scene where he attacks James  Wood's rag-tag band of vampire hunters he shows himself to be a very  powerful monster.  He cuts a guy in half using his hand like a sword, and  easily kills the whole team of hunters except for two of them.  He then  pursues a truck down the road on foot at nearly 100 mph and leaps fifty  feet into the bed.  He is more of the old-style vampire, unlike Frost in  Blade, who is a newer, hipper vampire.  If you like vampires or just good  action movies, you should see this.

But you know the way things are, and after watching 2 more times I began to love this film, it`s just SO cool and extraordinary, and there`s not a single Bond film like (thanks to George Lazenby). I`m glad Lazenby was cast as James Bond because I really can`t imagine Connery, or Moore crying over Contesa Teresa de Vinci`s dead body<br />Every time I watch it, it seems like a renude pleasure, there`s only 2 things wrong with the (atleast in my opinion): first of all, Blofeld should have recognised Bond and second of all, Donald Pleasence should have returned, but no, Telly Savalas was cast. Telly Savalas is still a wonderful Blofeld. The film is incredible one, buy it now and you won`t be disappointed, unless you HATE Lazenby of course............Good film, I rate it 5-Stars out of 5.

That being said, what I liked most about this film was that it was not "Hollywoodized". It gave a very realistic, straightforward story about a German U-boat crew and its experiences while carrying out their mission to sink Allied ships bringing supplies to Great Britain.<br /><br />After dodging destroyers and depth charges, enduring stormy seas, surviving being crippled on the bottom of the Mediterranean; they end up being strafed by Allied aircraft right in the theoretical safety of La Rochelle harbor. Most of the crew are killed including the captain - who's last sight was to see his U-boat sink in the harbor.<br /><br />All in all, a very entertaining war movie from an alternative perspective.

It's a good movie that shows you just how twisted and complex &quot;Batman&quot; really is.  He's not played out as some good guy without a care in the world, he's portrayed as a  vengeful, scared and somewhat chemically-imbalanced human being who just happens to be loaded and has a collection of &quot;wonderful toys.&quot;  In other words, Keaton plays the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; as human as a guy in a batsuit can be.  Although everyone talks about Nicholson, Keaton is the real treat here because he pulls off a character that no one really thought he could portray.  <p>Don't get me wrong, Nicholson is wickedly funny as our favorite villain, &quot;Joker.&quot;  He's a total jerk with a screw loose(not unlike our hero) who's hellbent on making everyone &quot;happy.&quot;  He is the glue that keeps this story together.  He's also the reason most folks who don't read comics went to the theater to check this movie out.<p>The special effects are excellent for the time period, and the supporting cast is good as well.  Kim Basinger is nice to look at, but she is probably the least convincing character in this film.  As other reviewers stated, the story is a little uneven, but it's made up for with the brilliant belltower climax.<p>In closing, &quot;Batman&quot; is what all superhero flicks should be:  1) True to the original concept of the characters(Manipulating 'Penguin' in the second flick was immoral) 2) Has an interesting storyline(unlike every sequel) 3) Good special effects that don't come off too cheesy(ref. every sequel) 4) A real cast that's actually interested in the story(no George Clooney) 5) And completely void of multiple arch-villains(Why did every movie after this one include two baddies versus &quot;Batman&quot; anyway?) <p>Enjoy this flick, and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy &quot;Daredevil&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; flicks as well.  They are just as dark and brooding.

 | product/productId: 6301972015 | review/userId: A3I6DTU1MS2W1Y | review/summary: Classic Sophistication | review/text: The first half hour of this movie might have you thinking that it will be a formulaic farce, but it quickly turns into a an interestingly off-balance look at the tension between societal expectations and true love, succeeding both as a light-hearted comedy and a serious commentary on the ultimate irrelevance of economic classes in the pursuit of love.<br /><br />  With lesser actors, the script might have turned into something heavy-handed and forced, but Hepburn, Stewart, and Hussey do a wonderful job of revealing vulnerabilities in their characters, something that transforms the action from soap opera to something special.  Cary Grant performs admirably in his role as the once-favored of Hepburn, but his role lacks the emotional range of the roles that Hepburn and Stewart played.  That aside, the acting is consistently great and quite moving, though 21st century sensibilities might find it a little too emotive.  The work of the young Virginia Weidler, who would die too young in 1968 of a heart ailment, is just one among many other hidden gems in this film.<br /><br />Please watch this film if you'd like an idea of what "romantic comedy" meant in the US at the dawn of WWII.

The story for me, was historical, as my great-grandfather was a postmaster in the 1800's, A history of what we take for granted today.<br /><br />Cosner's storys usually have had a historical/futuristic bent: and the significance for me. His "Dances With Wolves" was superb until the 'religious right" cut the guts out of the visual explanation of the movie's title. I can't find the original movie.<br /><br />I've come to view Cosner as a bigot at worse, a confused person at best and I forgive him. His religious beliefs override his being as a person; a human in his own right. The fruition of his thinking can't come forward because he's stuck in "faith."<br /><br />What a loss. A great mind stuck in idealogically.<br /><br />I'd pick the VHS over the DVD, any day.

 | product/productId: 6301810643 | review/userId: AZSN1TO0JI87B | review/summary: Still One Of The Best Movies Of It's Kind. | review/text: In 1989, Tim Burton and Warner Bros. brought Batman to the bigscreen, giving both Batman and Bruce Wayne a severe overhaul and finally giving him a movie that truly captures the purity of the character. Gone were any and all elements of the corny Adam West show of the 1960's. Here, a new and improved, darker and more complex Batman emerged. Personally, I love this movie. Always have, since I was [...] and was frightened by my first home-viewing of the movie. Opinions seem to go in every direction about this movie, but one thing that cannot be denied is that this incarnation of Batman was way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />To play Batman/Bruce Wayne, an unlikely candidate in Michael Keaton was elected. Delivering a somewhat neurotic and mysterious version of the Dark Knight, Keaton was complimented well by his nemesis in the Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson. Some may say Nicholson went over the top with his performance, but that's the way it should be. Balls to the wall is how Nicholson plays the Joker, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Nicholson delivers pure evil with a grin, and nearly steals the show from the Caped Crusader. These two performances alone just about make the movie what it is, and behind the direction of Tim Burton, create a movie that is really intelligent, moody and layered, but still has the accessible, popcorn movie feel that one should expect from any superhero flick. "Batman" delivers the goods, with just as much action as there is character development. The story itself may be a bit dodgy, but does a good job of telling the origins of Batman in a quick, and to-the-point manner, which helps push along the pace.<br /><br />Some may say that time hasn't been too kind to this film, and I'm likely to agree. Afterall, it was made in 1989, and with a soundtrack heavy on the Prince tunes, it's not hard to feel trapped in the 80's. So parts of it may be corny and truly dated, but it's still one of the best superhero movies to date. It set the standard for many movies to come, and for better or for worse, paved the way for many other Bat flicks and pushed Batman's relevancy to the point where now, he is just about the most recognizable superhero the world over. "Batman" is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve. Worth watching over and over again.

The movie is a wonderful comedy made in 1986 that is set in the early 1900s. The Three Amigos go to put on a show with someone that they believe is a great actor in Mexico, but rather were requested to actually fight the "infamous" El Guapo.  Comedy actors like Jim Carry and Eddie Murphey could learn from this brilliant movie.
 | product/productId: 6300146464 | review/userId: A2EDZH51XHFA9B | review/summary: Could have been groundbreaking, but no one picked up on it. | review/text: Final Exam (Jimmy Huston, 1981)<br /><br />The best thing about Final Exam is a spoiler, and so I can't really come right out and say it, but it's something that really, really confused me when I first saw it back in the day and really, really impresses me now. It's something that I can't remember any other slasher film doing, before or since. Which if you think about it is pretty darned impressive. That's not to say this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly makes it memorable. I hadn't seen it, before a few nights ago, in something like twenty-five years, and I still remembered a great deal about it. (Of course, this could be because I also still had the novelization of the movie, and read it obsessively in seventh and eighth grades; for that matter, I may still have my copy around here somewhere, as beaten-up as it must be by now.) One way or the other, though, it was much as I remembered it, though now dated and seeming somewhat clich&eacute; now that I have a larger grasp on the history of slasher movies than I did in the early eighties. Back then, I'd only seen two or three. I don't want to think about how many I've seen now...<br /><br />Plot: it's time for finals (actually, I could swear that in a few places, they say it's actually midterms, but I guess Midterm Exam didn't quite have the same ring to it) at a small college in the middle of nowhere. A killer struck (in the movie's opening scene) at another college just down the road, which has got everyone pretty keyed up as well, which isn't helped when the local numbskull fraternity plays a practical joke that sends some of the more gullible students scurrying for the cops. (Cue obvious "boy who cried wolf" subplot.) Of course, the killer has migrated, and starts picking off some of the last students left on campus, as most have already gone home for break.<br /><br />It's your typical slasher, except for that one thing (the question you're left with at the end of the movie? Yeah, that one thing), so don't go into it looking for any revelations vis-a-vis the acting, camerawork, score, or anything else; it's very typical of its subspecies in every other way. Still, that one thing does make it well worth your time if you're even a casual fan of the slasher movie, so in that case, you should probably hunt it down. **
 | product/productId: 6302098505 | review/userId: A1FG4KHP60L729 | review/summary: For animal and nature lovers | review/text: This film is a highly fictionalized version of what was actually a true story in the book of the same name by Gavin Maxwell.  As fiction, the screenplay takes dramatic license in ways both entertaining and trivializing.  But what the film does most compellingly depict is the beauty of the Scottish  shore, the uniqueness and remarkability of otters, and the life-changing relationship between a man and his otter.  I was one of the children who grew up watching the movie, "Born Free."  Those not of this generation may not be able to relate to the effect the movie ("Born Free") had on our culture and our awareness of animals as conscious beings (probably had a big part in giving rise to the enthusiasm for animal rights and the animal liberation movement that occurred some years later).  I found "Ring of Bright Water" equally moving, albeit not for the same reasons, but for that same way of depicting animals with dignity and humor.  In the more than ten years since I've seen this movie, I never forgot it and eventually bought a copy of my own [....])
 | product/productId: 0783224338 | review/userId: A35ZK3M8L9JUPX | review/summary: Dante's Peak | review/text: A vulcanologist arrives at a countryside named Dante's Peak after his boss instructs him to investigate the possibility of a dormant volcano (Dante's Peak) getting active again in that region. As story progresses, we see that Dalton is getting increasingly convinced that the volcano might blow up but his boss is reluctant to declare an emergency in the city yet because of possibility that if the volcano finally does never erupt, the real estate prices will plummet anyway and the city might loose a huge financial investment deal. Unfortunately, the common residents of the area know nothing about it until very late. Finally, when Dante's Peak does erupt, the city panics, some does not survive the catastrophe, including Dalton's boss and for Dalton and the mayor of the city who falls in love with Dalton and her children, it becomes a race against the pyroclastic cloud to save their own lives. There is plenty of good action and it really keeps you on the edge of your seats. Pierce & Linda gave outstanding performances and the photography was great through out the entire movie. Very entertaining.

Every few years you see yet another Austen film from Masterpiece Theater or the BBC or some studio, with yet another updating of an Austen novel.<br />Well, I'm announcing it formally right here and now: no more versions of Sense and Sensibility will be needed, because this one can't be exceeded.<br /><br />This is a truly towering achievement by director Ang Lee and screenwriter/actor Emma Thompson.<br /><br />The story is fabulous, the cast is superb, the settings and costumes are incredible, but here's the thing: this movie, with it's gorgeous lighting and photography, is simply the most visually beautiful film I've ever seen. You will be stunned when you see the sweeping expanses of the English countryside, the magnificent gardens and walled estates, all lit so carefully and exactingly. The HD version of this film may very well induce multiple screaming orgasms among cinephiles, it will be so spectacular.<br /><br />A career-defining role for Hugh Grant, who has the self-effacing, sensitive and lovable fumbling schtick down perfectly. Emma is one incredible actress, certainly one of the greatest performers alive today. Alan Rickman is incapable of delivering an uninteresting take on anything he's in, and finally, the luminous Kate, the English Rose, with her flawless, dew-dropped peaches and cream complexion, is Sense personified.<br /><br />If you don't own this movie, you are losing out big-time. If you don't like English period romances, you have no taste.<br /><br />Period.

Gattaca is one of the very few that genuinely deserves it. In a nutshell, it's the story of a mutt (Ethan Hawke) bypassing and surpassing a world that's designed against him. This movie really affected me (another overused appraisal.)<p>Maybe I just love this movie because I relate too much to the protaganist, Vincent. Despite everyones expectations, from my high school counseler on, and my lack of any prestigious schooling, I'll soon have my physics PhD.<p>This is a wonderful movie.

 | product/productId: 6300213803 | review/userId: A3G1GFI4YKCH1H | review/summary: The best of the classic Trek cast | review/text: Star Trek has great potential to be stuck in the hokey-schlok-weird-alien-meets-handsome-human-explorer rut.  Although the franchise still occasionally visits this pit, more often than not it avoids the fall.  Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan works the best out of all the classic Trek movies (ending with The Undiscovered Country) because of its superior story and action, its special effects (which still look pretty good today) and direction.  Wrath of Khan also caters two strengths Star Trek that have made the franchise so enduring: character and theme.  There are universal themes throughout the movie that make this sci-fi world applicable to our own; aging, facing and confronting death, the value of life, etc.  The themes are  subtly woven into the text and character interaction so that they're not didactic bombardment, but rather thoughts to be examined later.  Another great part of this movie is that this was the first time that you saw your favorite Trek characters and its beloved ship actually wounded to a severe extent, physically and emotionally, by an unexpected, malevolent force.  The stakes had never been this high before.  This was a true crises and its wonderful to see the shock, the response, and the ultimate price.  This review has a 4.5 star rating actually, and the only downgrade is for the low, occasionally rotten, acting.  Most of the time the cast sticks to their roles admirably, but some lines (particularly by Shatner and Montalban) are either grossly underdone or laughably overdone.  Nevertheless, the script (by long-time Trek writer Harve Bennett) and solid direction of Nicholas Meyer move the story at just the right pace.  Plus, they manage to create a truly honest, tender moment between Kirk (Shatner) and his son, David.  With a notoriously over the top actor like Shatner, creating that kind of moment is a true accomplishment.  Don't let the acting fool you.  This is a beautiful script and a well told story.
 | product/productId: 0783216084 | review/userId: A3Y6GNHCOER58 | review/summary: "You'll never go in the water again!" | review/text: This is the movie that really reminds me of high school; it came out the summer before I started my senior year, the summer I turned 18.<br /><br />"Jaws" was the "Psycho" of my generation. I don't apply this term to "Halloween", another equally scary film of the '70's involving pointy things that can kill you, because "Jaws" and "Psycho" have too very important elements in common with each other, and "Halloween" somehow seems to fall into a different horror genre.<br /><br />Both "Psycho" and "Jaws" are about ordinary people doing something ordinary and enjoyable, two activities one would normally never find dangerous: showering, and splashing about in the shallows of the ocean.<br /><br />I don't remember, but I can't imagine that this movie made people very happy whose livelihood depended on beach tourism, as it was released in the early summer.<br /><br />Seeing "Psycho" made many people afraid to take showers (including actress Janet Leigh, who starred in it and claimed she never took another shower afterwards), and "Jaws" made many people afraid to swim in the ocean. It scared the hell out of us teenagers and made for endless pranks at the beach that summer (hey, I was 17 when it came out in the theater, what can I say)? Two of my friends would take turns pretending to be an approaching shark in the water, using his hand as a fin, while hmming the classic "Jaws" soundtrack, or pretending to be the first victim in the film (minus the screaming, which upset the lifeguards), thrashing and flailing about in the waves as if being attacked and dragged underwater.<br /><br />"Jaws" was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster. It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star). It spawned one of the most classic and oft-quoted lines in film history: "We're gonna need a bigger boat." It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this film in several years, having seen it umpteen times when it first came out, and several times on VHS, as I owned an old VHS copy of it. But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full-screen only old tape).<br /><br />Suffice to say that when the head pops out of the boat...I still jump just as much as I did the first time I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />The ultimate, and best, of the "Scary Summer Movie" genre.<br /><br />This "Special Edition 30th Anniversary Edition" (widescreen, of course) of the film includes some great special features such as deleted scenes and outtakes, a never-before-available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two-hour documentary of the making of the film. The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot; I can certainly see why the shot of Robert Shaw's clog-sheathed foot stepping out of a big black car with the words "QUINT" in white and a white outline drawing of a shark on its door were cut! Shaft! We never knew ya!
 | product/productId: 6300214540 | review/userId: A2INBQ5UG0HB8G | review/summary: Top Gun Blu Ray edition........WHOOOOSH | review/text: Well, the dialogue is down right corny and the actual "in cockpit" footage isn't all that great given the fact that this is supposed to be about pilots and their machines, the fact of the matter is, if you loved Top Gun when it first took flight back in the 80's it's all the more reason to see this in HiDef.  The sound track in any set up outside of plain stereo is great and the sounds of the jet engines swooshing by you from front to back and left to right and so on is just booming.  I could do without the sausage fest of the volleyball scene but that was the hook for the female crowd.  I could do with more flight scenes and fight footage but I didn't write the script.  The videos of the songs are a nice inclusion, too.
 | product/productId: 1564427811 | review/userId: A2MAT0XWIGKQLH | review/summary: See Ya Later Alligator | review/text: Okay, so plot pretty simple:<br /><br />  A group of young kids accidentely kill a young girl durring a game of "killer" (ummmm), someone saw what happened....and is out for revenge.<br /><br />  YEARS before "I Know What You Did Last Summer" was written there was "Prom Night".  The idea is pretty much the same, although the kids as teen-agers don't really seem to show any remorse for what they did (besides Jamie Lee's boyfriend).  So it's hard to connect the teens to the killing they did when they were little.<br /><br />  This movie is ALL about red herrings.  The killer is a mental patient, the killer is the Bully at school, the killer is the janitor....I'm surprised they didn't put a pair of black gloves in Jamie Lee's locker....it doesn't matter though, the killer's identity was a surprise to me at least, when I first watched it when I was 15 (I'm 21 now).  The Red herrings work I guess, although I never really thought it was the Janitor or the mental patient.  Speaking of the mental patient, I guess he got blamed for the little girls death, and escapes years later leading the police to think he's coming back to Hamilton High.  This part of the film was disstracting to me, but after knowing the ending it's become downright unbearable.  TOTAL miss-direction, and once you know it for what it is...it gets boring.<br /><br />  However I think that it's good they put it there, to keep you guessing.<br /><br />  The death scenes are not that great, except for the little girl falling through the window in the beginning.  There's definete style to this film and came on the radar just after Halloween, but before Nightmare and Friday...so it wasn't stock in the sense that that it's bimbo's running around naked.  The characters are actually developed though not that like-able.<br /><br />  Jamie Lee's character is pretty much what you would expect from her in those early days, so I won't go into that.<br /><br />  My favorite part is the prom...and the music....I WISH I could have had a light up dance floor at mine, and the music (though all the songs kinda sound the same) went great along-side the flashing lights....really creating an atmosphere of glitz, lights and dance.  Just what Prom should be.  A Night to remember....or dismember...lol, sorry.<br /><br />  One thing I did hate about the film, is the ten minute chase scene.  The killer goes after Wendy, the bitchy popular girl (though she never really seemed to have friends) who looks like she's 30!  It goes on and on, and the song is the same "Prom Night...everything is allright" so it gets very old, very fast.<br /><br />  But overall, it's a fun slasher....a slasher that came out before the genre got tired.  If you love disco, this will be your wet dream.  If you love Sexy ladies....this probably won't do much for you.  The girls weren't really that attractive (besides Jamie Lee, though that hair made me wanna pull it out strand by strand).  But it was nice that the teens (who did look a bit too old) were normal.  They looked like every-day kids, which is great considering the New Prom Night movie is gonna be all hotties like Brittney Snow....lame.<br /><br />  This stays in my collection as one of the greats.  And it kicked off an...interesting series to say the least.  Let's hope Prom Night 2008 will get us a special edition release of the original with commentary from Jamie Lee!  (hey, I can dream!)<br /><br />  -DeNis

The Knight Sabers leader (Dr. Stingray) is a super-genius who designed (and keeps improving) the hard suits which are the only thing that can defeat Genom's android fighting units.  Anime pinup idol Priss, the toughest one, is as daring on a motorcycle as she is beautiful. Linna is a great athlete while Nene is a computer hacker.  Inter-personal relationships between these 4 are done really well.<p>There are lots of fighting scenes for those into that, but the story is really about the state of society (a possible future for us) and why the girls put their buts on the line and try to change what they can.<p>The music is like what MTV used to play, back when they actually played music videos.  Those really into this (Or fans needing to see more of the Knight Sabers in action) will love the &quot;Hurricane Live&quot; bonus DVD.  Kind of nostalgic, but not obnoxious as some 80's revival stuff tends to be.<p>Overall this MegaSeries is a great value with all 8 &quot;OAV&quot; episodes in this box set. The animation is a bit dated compared with more recent releases, but the story line is still better than most recent releases.<p>Anime doesn't get much better than this.  A must for &quot;best of class&quot; collectors.  (Word on the 'net is that this OAV series is superior to later derivatives).

Beyond this star's astonishing portrayal, the fun of this whodunit comes from the fascinating assortment of characters he interrogates, played by some of our most accomplished acting veterans: Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Wendy Hiller, and John Gielgud among them. Predictably, in addition to Finney, old pros Hiller and Gielgud steal the show. "Murder" should be nirvana for any mystery lover, and director Lumet gives the film plenty of period charm and atmosphere.

He took his style to Hollywood after this one. All the elements of a Hitchcock thriller are here. We have the mistaken man plot. Our hero has stumbled on a den of spies. He must prove his innocence and thwart the theft of military secrets and escape Scotland Yard from London Music halls to Scottish moors. The Hitchcock blonde is Madeline Carroll and her stocking scene must have been tough for American censors. Hitchcock learned his craft from the German expressionists and you can see the darkness of that genre in this gem. In the top twenty of best movies ever made, I recommend 39 Steps.
 | product/productId: 0790732009 | review/userId: A2GYCEAZYQ0ZUY | review/summary: Enter the river at your peril | review/text: "Deliverance", John Boorman's harrowing depiction of a white water rafting expedition gone horribly wrong, was an Oscar nominee for best picture the same year as "The Godfather"(1972) and is, in some ways, a companion piece featuring a quartet engaged in male bonding. Instead of the ultimate crime family of three wildly disparate sons presided over by an immigrant patriarch, "Deliverance" offers up three suburban males following the misguided quest planned by a fourth,who is besotted with a half-baked sense of environmentalism and sure of his own macho capabilities. The role of Lewis offers Burt Reynolds a chance to play against the rowdy physicality of his previous roles, but the most complex and challenging role is owned by Jon Voight, midway between his Oscar nominated turns in "Midnight Cowboy"(1969) and "Coming Home"(1978). Voight evolves from a mild mannered fellow comfortable with his middle class existence to a bow and arrow wielding seeker of revenge for the death of one friend and the (spoiler alert) rape of another.<br />Set as it is deep in woods soon to be flooded in a dam building project, "Deliverance" shares some of the same concerns that would animate Boorman's "Emerald Forest"(1985), but instead of Amazonian natives whose very existence is in peril, this film gives us a gallery of threatening backwoods types, whose genetics are as inbred as their penchant for violence. The sole exception is the banjo playing boy whose digital wizardry in the "Duelling Banjos" scene with Ronnie Cox is the most memorable aural component of the film. Even the local sheriff, played by the author James Dickey, proves an unsettling presence, and not just because he seeks to uncover the truth behind the death of the Cox character.<br />The Blu-ray iteration of the film, released in 2007, is an early example of the species and probably the best version we're ever going to get. The source material reflects the era of its production with some muddy and overly saturated colors and obvious use of blue screen. Imperfect as it may be, "Deliverance" in Blu-ray still has the power to haunt. Who can forget "Duelling Banjos" or the dead arm reaching up from the water? This is no lady in the lake proffering Excalibur, but rather a reminder of how close supposedly civilized man is to his primitive ancestors who can be accessed both in dreams and in times of great stress.
 | product/productId: 630021625X | review/userId: A1TK6R2JSC97HL | review/summary: The triumph of the spirit - on ice. | review/text: This is an unforgettable mix of history and the study of human nature with supernatural overtones.  Peter Finch plays Nobile, the ill-fated Italian explorer who, years after a doomed 1928 expedition to overfly the North Pole in an airship, must confront the restless spirits of those whose lives were destroyed.  With his Roman apartment turned into a court of inquiry, Finch faces not only those killed when arctic winds tore his airship in half and split his crew up, but others whose lives were ruined by their loss, suffered from botched rescue attempts or otherwise suffered the horror of survival.  (The crew car of the dirigible "Roma" is torn clean from the main body of the airship, and those left in the now powerless gasbag on top can only look helplessly as they float away from their comrades.)  Among the accusers stands Nobile's fiercest rival, the legendary Roald Amundsen, (Sean Connery) and Claudia Cardinale as a crewmate's lover.  "Tent" excels because it rises above just telling the story of the expedition.  Instead, the film delves deeper into human nature, and the drama that men try to create.  (One unforgettable moment has Amundsen escaping the wreck of a plane in which he had planned to rescue his rival.  In a twist of fate, and to underline his own doom, Amundsen emerges from the ruined plane to discover the wreck of the Roma's main body and the now dead crewmembers who floated away with it.  Inside, he finds a bible opened to an ominous verse.  A fellow accuser chastises Amundsen - the found bible seems to have been a detail invented for dramatic purposes.  But this seems acceptable, since man needs some drama to highlight his own pitiful existnce.  Isn't that why men take to exploration in the first place?)  <p>Guilt isn't so much the issue, decides a surprisingly sympathetic Amundsen who lost his life in one of the rescue attempts.  Instead, Nobile cannot be punished for being no worse under the circumstances than his accusers who were, in turns, incompetent, greedy or unreasonably pious.  The last of these earns one of Nobile's ascetic accusers, Amundsen's harshest rebuke.  Piety, Connery says, is nice, but it's human nature to think for one's own pleasure.  If a man can't think for his own good he is less likely, not more, to think of the good of others.  Foregoing pleasure isn't pious, but sterile, and leaves only bitterness for the survivors.  "You should have given her one last night of pleasure" Amundsen concludes.  It is only after he discredits his fellow accusers that Amundsen offers what is both the most damning yet redeeming evidence: when boarding a rescue plane that can carry only him but not his crewmen off the ice-floe, the General thought not of his men's welfare, but of the warm bath that awaited him back in civilization.  <p>The "Red Tent" is in turns heart-breaking, incisive and also quite funny.  Finch is fun, but Connery runs the show (it's interesting to compare how he looks today and how he looks here, made up prematurely old).  The other characters are more one-note, but, like good leaders, Nobile and Amundsen are more than capable of putting their qualities together to form a complex whole.  A must-see.

 | product/productId: 630018286X | review/userId: A29QA79VLQGHY6 | review/summary: Eerie and erotic | review/text: "Cat People" blends the eerie with the erotic, benefiting from a literate script and artsy production values. Universal, eager to mine its horror properties as the genre came back strong during the late 1970s, decided to remake some of its classics, notably "The Thing" (also in 1982). The studio turned to Paul Schrader for an update of Val Lewton's 1942 "Cat People." Universal has released the film as a widescreen DVD with plenty of extras... <p>Schrader, riding high on the success of "American Gigolo," wasn't a fan of the original film and later tried to have the remake retitled. He saw the project as a chance to "work on my control of the visual language." The project ended up being "as personal or more personal than any film I'd done," the director says in his excellent commentary.<p>Key to Schrader's vision was Italian production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti ("The Last Emperor"). Schrader even tried to tag "Cat People" as "A Film by Paul Schrader and Ferdinando Scarfiotti." The detail-obsessed Italian ultimately was credited as a "visual consultant" because of his union status.<p>Shot largely in New Orleans, "Cat People" stars Malcolm McDowell and Nastassja Kinski as siblings cursed to live as half-leopards. The sensual and sometimes silly film ended up "more skin than blood," Schrader admits. Kinski's nude scenes should bring out the animal in most male viewers -- including the one that inspired that poster with the snake.<p>Schrader spins some great yarns. Cocaine fueled much of the production. The director became obsessed with the young Kinski. Handlers wrangled dangerous leopards, losing one manic cat in the process. Scarfiotti hid his sets until shooting.<p>The director points out a lot that's not apparent, such as the ambitious sets and John Whitlock's beautiful matte paintings, created at the dawn of the CG era. The matte work's transformation of the sets is demonstrated on the disc. Other extras include Schrader's recent docu "Cat People: An Intimate Portrait," a breakdown of Tom Burman's pre-CG special effects and director Robert Wise paying tribute to original "Cat" man Lewton. <p>Images are decent for a film of that era. Some outdoor shots have a MOW haze, but the set work looks fine. There is limited speckling. Giorgio Moroder's synth scores comes through strong and sure in Dolby Digital. The package says the audio is 2.0, but there is clearly surround encoding.

In a day when low-budget SF flicks were all in black and white, this ruby-hued gem was  dazzling, filmed in &quot;Cinemagic&quot; - a kind of solarized and  red-tinted film processing gimmick. So boost the color control on your TV  to the max and get your retinas scorched the way audiences did in 1960. Sid  Pink's pics tend to the bizarre - &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;,  &quot;Reptilicus&quot;, &quot;The Man From O.R.G.Y.&quot; and of course the  camp Hans Conried classic &quot;The Twonky&quot; about an alien TV set that  takes over a geek's household. This film is no exception. This time four  astronauts land on Mars, only to find they are unwelcome. Armed only with a  sonic ray gun named Cleopatra -- &quot;because she's such a cool doll&quot;  -- our intrepid quartet must fight off a meat-eating plant with a yen for  red-haired Irish-American exo-biologists, a 40-foot-tall bat-rat-spider  drooling over a goateed, pipe-smoking professor, and a one-eyed blob the  size of a mountain that wants to devour their spaceship with everybody in  it. All the while they are ogled by three-eyed, two-horned Martians with an  attitude problem. Hand-painted sets, puppet monsters, beatnik dialogue,  nothing but red as far as the eye can see, and a jazz xylophone score -  hey, daddy-oh, this is like coolsville.

I think the vast majority agree it's one of Hitch's best, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The Universal transfer is NOT anamorphic, which means if you have a HDTV you're going to be either watching this in "zoom" mode or window-boxed AND letterboxed.  Frankly this is inexcusable, this DVD was released on September 2, 2003 and by that time EVERYTHING that's not 1.33:1 aspect ratio was anamorphic.<br /><br />So Universal dropped the ball with this DVD (and the whole set)...I would steer clear and use your old VHS copies until they get around to releasing the "super-deluxe Hitchcock collector's edition".

Can't say great, cuz I don't think it is, but it is good, that's for sure. Acting is great, the score is really good, and even though I am not really a Brian De Palma fan, I enjoyed this movie. I think it's not what he usually does.<p>Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks give a superb acting to the point of really believe their characters. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a movie with something to say. Too bad the DVD contains no features at all, not even the theatrical trailer, which is the least you can ask form a DVD.
 | product/productId: 0790745828 | review/userId: A1ZKPET0VDG25V | review/summary: Not the great movie everyone here thinks... | review/text: Even though I own this DVD, I would never say it's a great movie.  Most of the other reviews here must be from people in their 40s and beyond (I'm in my 30s).  I say that because they must have seen this movie when they were young and it affected them in a way that has colored their current point of view.  IMO, this is one of Clint's most forgettable movies, along with 'Where Eagles Dare', and later, 'Heartbreak Ridge', 'Pink Cadillac', and 'The Rookie'.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that Clint isn't a 'group guy'-he's a loner and that's one of the key ingredients that makes so many of his other movies work.  Though his character is seen as an 'off by himself kind of guy', he's still part of the unit.  For him to be able to drive jeeps around and do his own thing (on apparently his own schedule) doesn't jibe.  When you're in the military, your a grunt, stuck with the rest of the grunts.  There are no allowances made just because you'd rather be alone.  You're thrown in with the rest, and you're your stuck with them.  Even though Kelly outranks a lot of the other guys, he is supposed to be part of that unit.  For him to have carte blanche to roam around as he does isn't believable.  Had the storyline had Kelly as someone (not necessarily a soldier) who was a lone entity, with no ties to any one group or side, it would have played out better imo.  With Clint forced to be a part of the group, he looks constipated trying to squeeze his words out.<br /><br />Another thing that detracts from the film is all the bickering.  Some of it is amusing at times (gotta love Sutherland's Oddball), but the majority of it presents the characters as men who only know how to communicate through yelling, complaining, and berating each other.  I realize this IS a war movie (as in, none of the characters WANT to be there), but realize it is a MOVIE, and as such, a balance needs to be struck where the men's frustration with being stuck in the military (and overseas at war) should be mixed with other aspects of the human personality.  The humor here is all biting sarcasm-not surprising for a war movie, but a one trick pony nonetheless.<br /><br />'Kelly's Heroes' is one of a long line of movies (and TV shows) that takes place during one war, but are aimed at commenting on another (the Vietnam War).  The fact that this is a caper movie inside a war movie is a not so subtle comment that war is for profit-nothing more.  I agree with this sentiment.  Wars aren't started (and prolonged esp) by men with big hearts out to save lives and extinguish tyrants.  They are to protect assets and/or forcibly take them.  The Iraq War is a very obvious example.  We have a long history of business with Iraq-including when Suddam was in power.  They were once an ally.  Time has a way of burying the truth (actually, men do...and do).<br /><br />Anyway, unlike the others here, I don't think this movie has aged that well.  The war themes are indeed timeless, and the action scenes are well done, though the shooting of soldiers isn't that realistic imo.  But, the often one dimensional characters (particularly any of the non-Americans) make this a (mostly) mindless action movie without any real passion or guts (real emotion).  The movie doesn't take any chances, and suffers for it.<br /><br />I own it because it's a time capsule of Clint in his 30s (I'm still a Clint fan despite my feelings about this movie and I don't mind owning 2 star movies).  Clint's acting (finding his on screen power/personality) didn't move to the next level until he did 'Dirty Harry'.  He was forever changed after that-and he knew it.  He showed more depth in 'The Beguiled', but found his power (non-western) in Harry Callahan.
 | product/productId: 079284193X | review/userId: A1K4VAYQQLNFVS | review/summary: A silly comedy that shines - thanks to its stars | review/text: Let me start by suggesting that you buy, not rent, this movie, because you might well find it too silly at first, then you'll surprise yourself with the urge to watch it over and over again. Yes, with a plot that's nothing better than a good episode of &quot;Three's Company&quot;, the cast and crew deserved all the credits to make &quot;The Favor&quot; one of the most entertaining comedies reflecting various facets of love and marriage. Except for Elizabeth McGovern (who shines in almost every role given to her, especially in &quot;Men &amp; Women, Stories of Seduction&quot;), other actors seemed to deliver their best performances here: Harley Jane Kozak, Bill Pullman, Larry Miller, the Orti sisters... I give this film 5 stars, one of which goes to the screenplay that's full of hilarious one-liners, so wisely interwoven with simple but thought provoking dialogues (the conversation between Bill Pullman, Harley Jane Kozak and Leigh Ann Orti in the &quot;kitchen scene&quot; being my favorite one).
 | product/productId: 6302069122 | review/userId: A3BSS2M2DPPV4T | review/summary: A CULT FAVOURITE. | review/text: Frances Dee (she was also Mrs. Joel McCrea for 50 years) is a private nurse hired by handsome plantation owner Conway to care for his wife, who is suffering from a mysterious illness that has left her mute and in a permanent trance-like state.........Like JANE EYRE, the nurse falls in love with her employer, and in order to free him of his burden, she takes the woman to a voodoo doctor in the film's heart-pounding climax. Unlike its classic predecessor WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) which believes in zombies, Lewton's film lets you make up your own mind. Exquisitely paced by director Tourneur, the film unravels the motivations of its characters slowly, keeping you slightly off balance while trying to decide if the supernatural is fact or only belief. Adding to the uncanny mood is a calypso score plus amazing Darby Jones as a dude you wouldn't want to meet on a dark night! One of the great supernatural mood pieces of the cinema, this cult favourite derives from a series of articles written for a Hearst Sunday supplement by Inez Wallace. Initially skeptical, she claimed to have actually seen zombies working as slave labour on a Haitian plantation. Rather than being dead, however, they were very much alive, but deprived of the their voices and free-will by poisonous drugs!
 | product/productId: 630233683X | review/userId: A3QLAOOTFEHCJI | review/summary: Blu ray edition is a nice upgrade to this classic musical | review/text: This is a revisit to a movie I haven't seen in years.  Have I changed my view?  Nope.  In fact, watching the film on the new Blu ray disc more than confirms that the film still holds up after 60 years.  The video transfer maintains the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. While the images aren't quite as natural as you might like, there are very few distractions.  The colors are spectacular and the dancing is the greatest ever put on film.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seen here in his prime and in a tuxedo, could have been a great James Bond.  Cool, good looking with beautiful women all around.  Dancing never had a better stud.  Donald O'Connor is a second banana here, but check him out in his solo routine, "Make `Em Laugh".  He teams up with Kelly in a couple complicated numbers and you will never see better choreography.<br /><br />The story centers around the time when silent films made the transition to "talkies" (1927) and Kelly's leading lady couldn't make the jump due to her high pitched Brooklyneze voice.  Her voice and singing are later dubbed in by a newcomer named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds).  She's also Don's (Kelly) new fling.  This is all fun, inside stuff but the real action is on the dance floor.<br /><br />The film of course, features Kelly's take on the title song, which I've seen dozens of times.  It is still spectacular.  I had forgotten about the 13 minute dance sequence in the last act featuring Kelly and long-legged Cyd Charisse.  She dances throughout this number with a 30 foot long scarf flowing behind her.  It wraps gracefully around Kelly several times.  It is beautiful to watch, as is the whole movie.<br /><br />While the film in this Blu ray version is visually an upgrade from DVD, the audio is the real star.  The newest option is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It's a big deal.  The songs in particular have been given a wonderful mix.  The LFE channel is restrained keeping focus suggested by the original mono score.  Special features include a new documentary, commentary by several of the stars and others and a "jump-to-song" feature.  This is a pretty bare bones package (one disc) for what is a milestone film.

 | product/productId: 0783242808 | review/userId: A2QQHIY23PL7H3 | review/summary: Surprisingly touching for its genre | review/text: For a teen comedy flick with potty humour and "showcase" nudity, American Pie does really well with some coming of age themes. Four boys are on a quest to lose their virginity by prom night, and go to various lengths to impress the girls they meet. Life lessons are learned and the boys grow up in ways other than sexually. The four boys led by Jason Biggs are all likeable, and Seann William Scott had a breakout role as the party-loving fifth wheel to the group. Eugene Levy, one of great comedic alumnis from the 80s, has hilarious moments as Jim's dad. And for who can forget the Shannon Elizabeth scene and the bit with the movie's namesake?<br /><br />Not a lot on the dvd, but there's a fun commentary with the staff and actors, though it's a bit crowded at times. American Pie's not a groundbreaking film, but it's a solid one for its genre, and may be one of the few really worth owning.
 | product/productId: 0790734478 | review/userId: AX8SWWB9837TA | review/summary: A Gem Hidden in this Movie You may Have Heard About... | review/text: Action movies remind me of the true beauty of motion pictures, how a story can be told through visual arrangement and motion across the frame, instead of dead dialog and two motionless actors conversing.  Those movies are like filmed plays, while others draw from their silent black &amp; white roots, telling stories without words.  Road Warrior contains one of the finest examples of this - such a small moment, a minor obstacle overcome, yet which dances boldly across the screen like a painter.  <p>Here is the magic, shot by shot.  Halfway through the final chase sequence, a red hotrod approaches Max's big rig truck from behind with intention to kill him.  In a shot that has been copied many times, Max emerges from the cab and thrusts his shotgun into the camera - forced perspective, moving right then left, back to front in a zig-zag across the screen.  Bad guy's head explodes like a firecracker, and we are treated to a scream of delight from Max's wild wolf-boy friend - an animalistic reaction to violence ironically given from a child raised by animals.<p>Now we have a series of jump cuts which tell the little story of the red car losing control and hitting other bad guy vehicles.  That little story is closed by the famous and almost peaceful shot of one man flipping head over heels in a horizontal fall, again in forced perspective flying at the camera.  Now another series of jump cuts as we jump back to the red hotrod and it's fight to stay out from under Max's huge wheels.  In a beautiful play of movement, the car dances in front of Max's truck, darting back and forth in front of Max and our screens like a dangling carrot, until we have a third masterful forced-perspective shot: the camera approaches the grill of the truck, then moves up and into the cab at Max, when Max finally ends this car's misery by nailing it in an explosion of gasoline and metal bits.  Such sick, twisted beauty...  Did you know that George Miller, the director of Road Warrior, also directed Babe?

 | product/productId: 0783233078 | review/userId: A34PAZQ73SL163 | review/summary: Lost Times at Ridgemont High. | review/text: Many people remember this movie as being a wild, risque, and hilarious ride; well, it certainly is, but, as I noted when I saw this film yesterday, it is also a film that could no longer be made today. Our present social environment is too politically correct and repressive for it to get the green light from a major studio.  Regardless of what one thinks of Sean Penn personally, he is a dynamic and gifted actor.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in his role as Spicoli.  He is marvelous and the name of the would be surfer still evokes laughter from just about everybody I know.  Yet, the good times would be censored today as saying "He's a f-g" is not even remotely acceptable in the new century's Hollywood.  A comment like Mike Damone's that someone was a wuss, meaning a cross between a whimp and a p-ssy would probably be deleted from the final product.  One simply does not toss around a word like "p-ssy" in 2005.  Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy is a feminine and amazing triumph and the swimsuit scenes are more than memorable; however, the plot concerning her is more complex than we originally realized.  Twenty years later her travails would have to be radically altered.  In 1982, she was clearly depicted as a casualty of the sexual revolution.  By the final frames, despite her fellatio practice with Phoebe Cates and her one date hook-ups, she has decided that sex is not an end in itself.  She pines for romance.  Stacy learns a painful lesson that many girls would not be exposed to by the motion picture industry today.  To do so would make them feel as if they were distributing reactionary conservative propaganda instead of entertaining.  Other than AIDS, sex is usually depicted as being without cost, or, if there are costs, then they are not of any serious importance.  Stacy's experiences clash defiantly with our conventional wisdom.  She lusts not carnal lust but a meaningful connection with another human being.  The kind of intertwining that robotically occurs between two bodies is superflous to her needs.  In this way the film becomes an advertisement for restraint and self-control.<br /><br />Another way in which Fast Times... stands athwart our current path can be found in the "Kill Lincoln" buttons and displays the students wear before the big football game. Such items would never make it past a hall monitor in today's public schools.  Slogans like those would be deemed a sign of pathology and possibly warrant suspension.  Unfortunately for us, subject matter that is funny is now often condemned as being "hurtful" and "hateful."  If you ask me, let's bring back the days of Mr. Hand and Ridgemont High!

 | product/productId: 6301115848 | review/userId: AQP1VPK16SVWM | review/summary: Classic science fiction film receives nice Blu-ray release but this is a bare bones release | review/text: Don Siegel's film of Jack Finney's classic novel "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" remains a seminal, powerful science fiction classic. Seen as something of a political allergory by many critics in retrospect, director Don Siegel and producer Walter Wagner created a classic film that has continued to influence the genre even six decades later.<br /><br />Small town doctor Miles (Kevin McCarthy who is marvelous)returns to his hometown after a medical meeting to find that a little boy claims his mother isn't his mother. This isn't an isolated case as his former girlfriend Becky (the stunning Dana Wynter)returns to town to visit her father and tells Miles that her cousin is claiming the same thing about her father. It's almost like a mass delusion is gripping the town (although not identified there is a condition called folie &agrave; plusieurs i.e.,"madness of many" a shared delusion that takes root and is passed on). Miles goes along with that explanation until his writer friend (King Donovan)and his wife (Carolyn Jones) FIND a body without finger prints and, while not dead, he isn't alive either. Miles begins to suspect something darker is going on when he begins to notice the change in behavior of his friends.<br /><br />Olive Films which has adopted lesser known and older Paramount titles for release has done an exceptionally good tranfer for the film. Presented in black & white on a 25g disc in the original Superscope widescreen presentation (which the producer was against...something you might find out IF there was a commentary track by a film scholar or fan of the film), there is some inherent softness to some shots that can't be avoided (it's partially due to the post-production conversion process to the widescreen anamorphic process), but, on the whole, the film looks pretty darn good with nice sharpness and clarity. The encoding here is quite good.I didn't note any problems with flickering.<br /><br />There is some minor print damage noticeable but the print used for the transfer looks very good aside from those few moments. Even with the minor print damage, "Invasion" has never looked quite so good. Blacks are very good throughout in this presentation and the Blu-ray improves on the previous DVD release.<br /><br />Audio sounds quite nice with dialogue very clear. I didn't detect any overuse of noise reduction or at the least there's no noise reduction artifacts that I noted.<br /><br />There aren't any subtitles which is a surprise in this day and age.<br /><br />The one area that "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is very disappointing is the lack of special features. "Invasion" is a classic film and deserves a commentary track that focuses on the making of the film, the political meaning of the film (as interpreted by various groups over the years). The Republic Pictures DVD included an interview with the late actor Kevin McCarthy (it might have been nice if Olive Films had licensed the interview for this set) and the original theatrical trailer. We get nothing not even the theatrical trailer which is a missed opportunity.<br /><br />I am happy that Olive Films has taken up many of these films that the major studios have neglected or forgotten about for Blu-ray but I would like to see a greater effort to include some special features either produced for their Blu-ray editions or licensed from other sources. Don't get me wrong without Olive Films I doubt it would have been likely that this film was releasesd on Blu-ray so soon (or at all)but it would be nice to see a bit of extra effort put into these releases.<br /><br />Recommended for a very nice high def transfer and for the film itself but if you have the previous DVD (which this blows away in terms of image quality)you may want to hold on to it if you're attached to the extras for that edition.

 | product/productId: 078061965X | review/userId: AW4MT9WP95TVD | review/summary: A Holiday Classic?  You bet! | review/text: Well, kind of.  In my twisted household anyway.  This is one non-stop, action-packed thriller from beginning to end. Completely over-the-top - some of the torture scenes make you think of the real oldies with Little Nell and the railroad track, but boy is it fun.  Davis is truly cool here: funny and wide-eyed one minute, sleek and vicious the next.  Jackson is great as her somewhat unwilling cohort and the two have a great chemistry.  Bierko is SO evil he should have a mustache to twist.  Fun, very fun. All played out against a Christmas backdrop mind you.  A good triple feature with Die Hard and The Bells of St. Mary's. (LOL)  A must have for action freaks!  WAY TOO MUCH FUN!!!!!!

As long as this film is, there is not a let down moment.  It's a marvellous character analysis of a man who lived for the war.  Many priceless scenes with GEORGES C.SCOTT giving the best performance of his career. Among the highlights:PATTON and MONTGOMERY battling for their personnal ego;the general giving a slap to a war wounded and paying the price for his misconduct;his incredible knowledge about the history of wars;his incapacity to deal with the authority of his superiors etc.A truely fascinating study of a remarkable man who had guts.
 | product/productId: 630018157X | review/userId: A3VQSFORKH8B7O | review/summary: GOD BLESS GREGORY PECK!!! | review/text: I watched this film as part of TCM's Salute to Gregory Peck, one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen. He was great in the two versions of "Moby Dick" (as Ahab in the 1956 Version, and as Father Mapple in the 1998 USA Miniseries), and was excellent in "To Kill a Mockingbird." As for this film, Peck put his heart and soul into his portrayal of one of history's greatest military generals: General Douglas MacArthur. The scenes dealing with other people and events tend to lag at times, but Peck's outstanding performance and the epic battle scenes (featuring  visual effects that are awesome for 1977) make this film a must-own!! Grade: A+

The lovely thing about DVD is that my faded, scratched, spliced, and commercial-interupted memories of this film (and its sequels) are completely erased by a vivid, remastered version.  It's really a nicely made film.  I think the ape makeup survives today in this era of CG characters.  The story is solid.  I was surprised to see Rod Serling's name credited as one of the screenwriters!  I'd never realized this.  Then, as I proceeded to watch the movie, I began to see it as a feature-length TWILIGHT ZONE episode.  (*I mean this as a compliment!)  The movie introduces its human characters, strands them on a strange planet, then shocks its audience by revealing the apes 1/3 of the way into the story.  The film's final image is pure TWILIGHT ZONE, with an O. Henry twist to the whole story.  Brilliant!<p>The DVD looks great.  The sound is done well.  I wish there were more bonus items -- it's too bad that the APES documentary is only available by purchasing the entire set.  I'd love to get a gander at the makeup men and the set designers.  The look of these films is spectacular.<p>Watching APES again was a walk down memory lane.  Who would've known that Fox could get such mileage out of the APES concept!  5 films!  The original is the best.  And this DVD presentation does it justice.
 | product/productId: 5553627788 | review/userId: A2O6K23YDIP81M | review/summary: "THE" Best Movie Classic of all Time! | review/text: I have watched this movie fully at least 5 times so far in my short life (maybe up to 15 when I saw selected scenes). I can't think of any late 20th or early 21st century movies that even come close to beating the Sound of Music. Many of today's movies have too much crude humor, violence, and especially sex. Even some of today's PG movies are not very appropriate for children.<br /><br />I believe every child should be required to watch this movie and write an essay on it at least once before graduating from high school. There are so many life lessons that can be learned from this great musical such as the meaning of family and how music can bring people closer together. I would give the movie six stars if I could. The actors and actresses (and the whole crew) of the movie must have worked super hard back in 1965 to bring this brilliant masterpiece together! I was more than impressed by Julie Andrew's voice and I thought she was perfect for her role as 'Maria Von Trapp'. I still enjoy Julie Andrew's acting and watch movies that she stars in such as The Princess Diaries 1&2 and Mary Poppins. She has a great voice and is lucky to have played a central role in the most famous movie of all time. After all these years the movie is still a worldwide hit. I am guessing it will still be a classic in the year 2100 or at the dawn of the 22nd century.<br /><br />Anyway almost 45 years after the movie was made I definitely recommend everyone to see the movie at least once in their lifetime. It is the closest that you can come to experiencing "Heaven on Earth". I just wish that more stores would start carrying this movie on Blu-Ray, although the film is just as good watching it the prehistoric way which is on good old VCR! :)
 | product/productId: 0783228317 | review/userId: A38O27BDP2QECS | review/summary: MUST HAVE Blu-ray | review/text: Be aware that this review is biased, I am a huge fan of Hunter S. T. and thought this movie has a great on film representation of his work.  While not a family movie by any stretch of the imagination, and man are there some stretchy imaginations, it is an awesome movie to sit back and laugh out loud at.  It's a darker comedy, drug crazed epic that travels right through the heart of bat country.  This one must be watched more than once to fully enjoy the lines and great acting throughout the film.  I catch something that I never noticed before every time I watch it and recommend you do the same.
 | product/productId: 6301965701 | review/userId: AD0J5KK4WQXNS | review/summary: An intelligent slasher flick | review/text: This a film of two halves and a bit of a surprise. It begins by being a spy story but slowly transforms into a slasher movie on a par with and a lot scarier than Halloween or Friday the 13th. Basically imagine that you live on an island and a German spy is trying to escape from England with a microfilm of photographs that could win the war for the Nazis. Imagine that this ruthless killer finds himself trapped on an island with an only family living there. It is a terrifying film and in many ways it reminds me of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. If you can sit through this without closing your eyes you are a brave one. Donald Sutherland is remarkably creepy.

Get ready and prepare for the ultimate nightmare with this fine collection of "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies that are bound to send chills down your spine... and maybe get a few laughs out of you as well.<p>This set has every single movie in the series.  It has numbers 1 through 5, "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare," and "Wes Craven's New Nightmare."  All of them ready to pollute the DVD player and contaminate the TV screen.  Freddy's waiting for ya, don't you know?<p>The set includes a bonus DVD with a bunch of cool extras that any Freddy fanatic is bound to enjoy.  Also enclosed in the set are 3-D glasses (2 of them, I believe) that you can use for the end sequence of "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare;" something I don't even think is available in the single version of the film.<p>All of the movies are great, although I don't like the second one as much as the others.  It's all right, but could've been better.  The rest are great though.  Personally, I think the third one is the best, though many would argue that the first one is the superior movie.  But that's just my opinion.<p>So, are you a Freddy fanatic?  Do you love the "Elm Street" flicks?  Then what the heck are you waiting for??!  An invitation?  Get your hands on this horrifyingly superb DVD set that is bound to entertain you for hours.  If this is your first time meeting Freddy Krueger, never fear; he's been waiting for YOU...<p>Sleep tight!!!

 | product/productId: 5556167265 | review/userId: A37DZX4F5RU2PQ | review/summary: A JOY TO WATCH, A PLEASURE TO HEAR; POCAHONTAS IS A  CLASSIC | review/text: Brimming with lush animation and an Oscar-winning score, Pocahontas is an emotional tale of love, greed, communal hatred and sacrifice. Along the edge waters of Virginia, Pocahontas, the free-spirited daughter of Powhatan, watches as the mysterious shipload of settlers arrive led by the greedy governor Ratcliff and the courageous Captain John Smith. Along with her friends Meeko, a mischievous raccoon and Flit, a feisty hummingbird Pocahontas develops a strong friendship with John Smith which soon transforms into love. But when tension mounts between their two very different cultures, she must find a way to bring peace between the two communities.<br />  <p>The wonderful voice talent and Alan Menken's excellent music help in portraying the magic of this movie. Mel Gibson is exceptional as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith. Irene Bedard is good as Pocahontas and Linda Hunt is the perfect choice for the voice of Grandmother Willow. Christian Bale, Russell Means and David Ogden Stiers lend their respective talents as the voices of Thomas, Powhatan and Governor Ratcliff. The songs are very melodious and well-written (by Grammy winner Stephen Schwartz); the `Colors Of The Wind' being a true masterpiece (which won the Oscar for the best song in 1995).<br />  <p>Although historically inaccurate, the movie is unique in its visual style and in the message it conveys to us about love and sacrifice. The emotional depth is something I have never before witnessed in an animated feature. There are scenes which will truly touch your heart. I am a full grown adult, yet tears sting my eyes every time I watch the end. I think the true beauty of the movie lies in the ending.<br />  <p>  One more thing, the movie is certainly not for kids or for those who like fun-oriented animated stuff like `Toy Story' or `Shrek'. Although it does provide some humor and light moments, the plot is completely adult-oriented and revolves around communal harmony, which I do not think that kids will like very much. So if you are a real appreciator of emotional and artistic beauty and know the value of true love and sacrifice, go enjoy this movie. As for me, I think it is truly a timeless masterpiece.
 | product/productId: 0783225903 | review/userId: A1Y0HX12MCT6OR | review/summary: VERY DEEP/PROFOUND!(if you haven't passed highschool english) | review/text: People kept recommending me this movie over and over and it sounded pretty interesting, think Monty Python meets 1984, now think about it again, wait that sounds pretty awful doesn't it? Well that's this movie in a nutshell, but lets go over why it sucked in detail shall we?<br /><br />-Stupid Love Plot: Terry Gilliam tries to ape George Orwell by throwing in a forbidden love story, but here the guy falls in love with a lesbian truck driver and their love and bonding are shown through 'zany' 'wacky' car chases through many expensive sets. Why does he love her again? Because she looks like someone in his dream; wow this is genius, someone pass me more crayons to chew on.<br /><br />-The Main Character: the main character is a bumbling pathological liar, feel sympathy for him yet? Don't worry you won't, he pretty much is a clumsy oaffish drone that decides to throw it all away to 'follow his heart', and this is basically the jist of the movie. He's getting into wacky chase scenes with the police that is supposed to be funny or informative or something? Really though it just felt like one big budgeted cartoon that took itself seriously, and you're supposed to relate to this clod.<br /><br />-Other characters: You see his mom a few times getting her face stretched, then you see her in a coffin later in the movie. Wow plastic surgery... BAD?? Wow Terry, that's deep man. You also see Robert Deniro who probably was drunk on the set show up as a 'vigalante air conditioner repair man'. You read that right. He shows up, beats up the two government repairmen, fixes the idio-I mean hero's air conditioner than zip-lines away. It's like Terry Gilliam got his son in kindergarten to write that part. Oh and near the end when the hero's dreaming of his escape Robert DeNiro's character comes to aid him but then gets smothered by pieces of paper floating around. *Cough* *Cough* Wow man this movie's like blowing my mind, beauracracy... BAD? That's like, too deep man, pass me the bong... Other characters show up I guess to spoon-feed the presumably stoned audience the same boring message over and over: beauracracy bad. We get it Terry, thank you, you can show us something new now, yes thanks Terry, we... get it! Moving on now, yes?<br /><br />-The Stage Designs: The designs are admittably impressive, however with all of Gilliam's works they serve almost no purpose to the plot and is basically just Terry going "look guys, I've done drugs before!". Set piece after set piece is trashed/destroyed as a car plows through it or a character runs through one, and the fact that five minutes afterwards none of the set designs stuck with me goes to show that Terry's 'surrealism' is all bark and no bite. The main character's dream sequences weren't much better either, it was some dungeon's and dragon's fantasy that shows that office drones have dreams/aspirations too.<br /><br />So yeah, it's all one big lavish waste of time. The script/message is nothing new to think about if you passed high school, the story is strange and uninvolving and I didn't care about any of the characters or the main characters ultimately selfish aspirations, the only part I did like however was the ending, it was suprisingly grim which was a nice twist on things. If only the ride to that part had been more enjoyable.<br /><br />*Edit* For people telling me I don't 'get' it, wake up, there's nothing to get from this massively overrated live action cartoon geared towards pseudo-intellectuals.

 | product/productId: 0767835093 | review/userId: ARC5GYVVR3J2V | review/summary: &quot;The Selfish Pity of MAN&quot; | review/text: This film , the second from Director Doug Liman, is a high octane, stlyish, thought-provoking movie that borrows many of it's traits from &quot;Pulp Fiction(1994)&quot;. It's about a group people who become the victims of drug-trafficing,(e.g. ancitpating &quot;Traffic(2001)&quot; In a world full of hypocritcal, uncutlral-moronic-teens, The Drug dealer preys upon the weak-minded, infecting them , tainting their minds with the trait,  the art of Drug trade. But this event passed down to the weak-minded could go full-force, spreading, finding  it's way through the most ambigous of social classes. Whether it be teens, young adults, senior citizens, hetrosexuals, bisexuals, homosexuals. It could happen to anybody. But it doesn't go full-force unless you allow it to, unless you become your own victim of your own drug trafficing. It won't take that long until you go under, you break the law. And then you can't do anything about it, you have broken the law. Becasue the law has it's litmitions, and once you break that line, theres no turning back. You are an open parisite in a world that has no reason to your kind. Your better off dead. This movie shows how the art of Drug dealing can destroy one's life. It shows how ignorant, and stupid, and hopeless our society is.And As the ocupant hands you the dope, your the dope who's soul is being taken away. It also shows just how far some people will go to forget their troubles, how such a carless, remorseful soceity, can take a sip of beer,until it's too late and your drunk, and you wind up killing somebody who is merely crossing the street. It represents the &quot;selfish pity&quot; of MAN. We are our own enemys and killing machinces, just becasue were high on prozac,we figure we have to take a couple of lives on the way to our meeting with death. <p>  Substancially, the film isn't as nearly  multilyared or close to the symbolic nature of raw power, of such films as &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; or &quot;Resivoir Dogs&quot;, but what you have here is something that both on a entertianment stand-point,and intelectual prespective, beats out most competion of the norm of most films released during the 1999 period, let alone the late 1990's: and era filled with stupid, moronic teen flicks, that hamper almost every genre. Doug Liman's approach is both flashy,  stlyish, in it's molding, capturing the esscence of the adolence of American soceity. He may not hit upon the subject symbolically, but what he gives us is something insightful, eye-catching, smart, compently handled. And more important than anything:&quot; Entertaining&quot;<p>Rating: 3 1/2 out of 5<p>Garde: B 88%

 | product/productId: 6300248143 | review/userId: A1QSSKI2U33K4R | review/summary: Good sequel | review/text: Alien was an interesting contrast to Star Wars.  That's where the cult started. Alien had a lot of good hard nosed reality to it. In the characters and their interactions who knew what hard work was all about. Alien saw a group of people fight and die due to human weaknesses and strengths.  Aliens mopped up and tried to finish off the aliens.<br /><br />They shifted from the miner's hard life to the Marines and succeeded in watching a non-technological species haress, frighten, and kill off the vast majority. Aliens also had an interesting survivor in a little eight year old girl Nute.  She also led the Marines in how to survive the aliens, for a little while at least.<br /><br />Bill Paxton from Terminator gives another great performance of a punk.  He's absolutelly hillarious in both Terminator and Aliens!  Michael Bien also comes from Terminator to give another good performance to fight off something bigger than a human. Another James Cameron find and favorite was introduced in Aliens, Jenette Goldstein.  She also later appreas in Terminator 2 and Titanic!<br /><br />No movie or book is perfect; so, I've gotten in the habit of starting with a four star no matter what.  Five star . . . i don't know what's five star.  Can I find fault with Aliens?  Yes!  There's the awkward gravity fields when the marines are free-falling from orbit; now, wait a minute!  First, they're in orbit; so, just releasing them wouldn't cause them to just start free-falling; if them, then why not the mother ship?  There's not much to find fault with the move though; but, i did find something, so, my principle of starting with four stars no matter what works here.<br /><br />I finish with noting that I've thought of a solution to Ripley and the Marines problem of dealing with all those aliens and still have seventeen days to go!  Simply pack that marines battlestation sports car with food and head far away from the atmospheric processing plant . . . till it can't run no more.  Why would the aliens think to search outside the atmospheric processing plant for more hosts?  Private Hudson would have said F'in A to that!

 | product/productId: 0783221487 | review/userId: ACT95AH4X5MQI | review/summary: Just clarifying a point made earlier | review/text: This is the 'short' version (2hr 17min) and the only version finally approved by David Lynch.  The extended version (which can be bought here as well) is the one that Lynch disowned, insisting that it be labeled 'directed by Alan Smithee', the name used when a director refuses to put his or her name on a finished film.  In my opinion, however, the extended version is much more complete, and regardless of having been disowned by Lynch, provides a lot more background and insight into the characters in the film, and is almost word for word from the book.  Much more so than this version, which assumes the watcher has read the book and knows the background.  It's just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, but I recently purchased the other version available here which includes both versions of the film, both David Lynch's and 'Alan Smithee's' films, and it's only 2 dollars more than this one, and comes in a neat collectors tin with nice paperwork inside and a 2-sided DVD.<br /><br />Rob Hale

 | product/productId: 6300215814 | review/userId: AZYD3BG2R4SV8 | review/summary: Classic Romance with laughs | review/text: There are not too many people who have not seen or at least heard of this classic movie. Taking place in chic early 1960's NYC, Holly Golightly, played by the magnificent and lovely Audrey Hepburn, is a beautiful yet confusing young sophisticate looking for her way through life via chic parties and dating rich men. When she meets her new neighbor, Paul Varjak, a writer and kept man, played wonderfully by George Peppard, her world takes an unexpected turn but ever so slowly and with plenty of resistence by her own drive to marry any one of the world's richest men, whoever that will be.<br /><br />Patricia Neal, a stylish gal herself, is writer Paul Varjak's lady friend and<br />'financiere' and Buddy Ebsen plays a long past husband of Holly who tries to take her back home. The cast is further blessed with terrific and amusing performances by Martin Balsam (as Holly's agent), John McGiver (as the staid Tiffany salesman) and Mickey Rooney, in a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of a Japanese photographer who is constantly pestered by neighbor Holly's life style and antics. Even 'Cat' has a key role in this classic.<br /><br />The movie shows us NYC life in the early 60's and that alone is a treasure. Add to this the superb acting and terrific story line provided to us through Truman Capote's novella and you have a can't miss classic. The song classic 'Moon River' is born here as well, in a sweet scene between Holly and Paul.<br /><br />Audrey is superbly gorgeous and stylish and Mr Peppard fits her perfectly.<br />The movie is a perfect blend of comedy, romance with some light hearted tension here and there.

 | product/productId: 6301931793 | review/userId: A1H0Z27HXHZZ60 | review/summary: Child is Father to Man | review/text: A poignant film -- lending credit to the expression that &quot;child is father to man.&quot;  With so many films being produced that explore the negative violence in mankind, it is refreshing to see a splendid film that relishes the wisdom in youth.  Pelle allowed us to see the hope and strength that a new generation can bring to life. Although Pelle's father fell prey to his desires, Pelle struggled to keep his wits -- striving for something truly better.  Pelle chose the hard road instead of always giving in to indugences.  <p>This film would be an excellent choice as an initial exposure for young people to another genre of film.  Yes -- there is more to life than the overly violent monters created for the big screen.  Reality is much more compelling.
 | product/productId: 0800141806 | review/userId: A253W0EDTXK5E4 | review/summary: A startling and gripping performance by both | review/text: One of the great films of the last quarter century, it is about time that this movie comes to DVD as a special edition.  This is definitely one of Denzel Washington's best performances, but I have to believe that has a lot to do with the fact that the best actor of our time, Tom Hanks, played the starring role.  The interaction between both actors, and the beautiful characters they create, bring more goosebump worthy scenes to the screen than any movie has the right to have.  In what I consider to be Tom Hanks' single greatest scene of his career, I watched a moment that truly made me forget where I was.  Washington plays an ambulance-chaser who takes Hanks' lawsuit over AIDS discrimination, against his better judgement.  The opera scene, where Tom Hanks, walking around his apartment with an IV bag, explains to Washington about the pain and emotional struggle of a fictional character in an opera.  This scene is absolute perfection.  From the camera angles, to the lighting, to the performance by both actors, true emotion pouring through their skin to the very screen itself.  This scene has no peer.  The film is a great creation, from beginning to end, but, it is a must-own for anyone, purely because of this one moment.  Anyone associated with filmmaking, from writers to directors to actors, should order this DVD as soon as possible and study the passion and humanity involved in the making of this film.

John Travolta, as usual, plays a really good role and makes the movie what it is.  The movie is a bit gory, but the storyline is good.  I would recommend this movie to people who like to watch a good mob type movie.  It's worth it and don't forget the popcorn.

 | product/productId: 6301969294 | review/userId: ALXNJZDCLLLGP | review/summary: Never Compromise | review/text: Comparisons to Ayn Rand's novel can be made but the cinema and the written word are two different mediums. The gist of the story is intact in this film. The film's strength lies with Gary Cooper's performance as architect Howard Roark and the dialogue of his interaction with the film's other characters. Cooper's delivery at his trial is a screen classic. Patricia Neal and Kent Smith give very good performances. Max Steiner's score is one of his best.
 | product/productId: 630197347X | review/userId: A3QL4MY7TT0DAS | review/summary: A classic with a 2-star presentation | review/text: The story of mutiny on HMS Bounty has been told and retold many times. It may be classified as an allegory for what power and corruption can generate (think American Revolution).  When people are pushed too far, either in reality or in their own mind, the result is backlash, such as occurred on HMS Bounty. There have been many theatrical versions of MOTB from the first in 1916 to the last Gibson-Hopkins version in 1984. The most notable were the 1962 Marlon Brando and the 1935 Clark Gable versions.  Of all, the most memorabe one was the 1935 run.  The acting was top-notch and showed a compassionate Fletcher Christian torn between duty and human responsibility culminating in the mutiny in the 1780s. On the flip side was the superb rendition of Captain William Bligh by the indomitable Charles Laughton, one of the greatest actors ever to grace stage and screen. Like a politician, Laughton displays a man who is doing everything to insure his future comfort at whatever expense to his conscience or to others. He is totally self-centered with little regard for his men and possesses a somewhat sadistic flair.  The entire film is enjoyable from beginning to end and draws the viewer in with it. Now for the 2-star presentation! It appears that this was a straight transfer from a previously produced VHS Print. One wishes that Criterion could have gotten into the act since they do not usually put out a product unless it has been pain-stakingly restored with images that are clear and sharp as the original film was (Hint to major studios releasing their films).  Overall, however, the rating remains 10 on a one-ten scale for one of the finest motion picturs ever produced.
 | product/productId: 6302054974 | review/userId: A19YCP13JVBPB | review/summary: Good, but certainly not great. | review/text: Although it's one of the most original mob films made to this date, I found it to be fairly slow.  <p>The first part is pretty interesting in how they set up the story, and how Ray Liota's character becomes involved in the mafia.  After that, though, I think it became very slow and boring.  I think I would recommend seeing this film once, but when I tried to watch it again, I lost interest after the first few scenes.
 | product/productId: 080012166X | review/userId: A1LZVU5SRRM3VX | review/summary: Nice Dracula adaptation, Superbit format gets mixed review | review/text: First of all, I have enjoyed the film from my first viewing in the theater to my most recent viewing on the Superbit DVD.  The film gives a rich, tragic subtext to the Dracula legend that most other films ignore in favor of gory special effects or cheap scare tactics.  The cast is spectacular, featuring Gary Oldman as the fanged one, Winona Ryder as his lost love, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, and Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker.<p>The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the digital transfer of the film.  Although I recognize that the film was released over a decade ago, Columbia apparently didn't take the time to digitally restore the film before the transfer, as there are still some visible pops and dust even on the Superbit edition.  The 5.1 soundtrack, however, will blow you away.  It was so crisp and clean, I had to turn down the sound significantly so that I did not wake up my baby. The soundtrack makes good use of all channels and covers the discriminating viewer who has a decent home theater system in excellent sound quality.  Thus, the movie sounds great, but I could not discern a significant quality difference in the picture from other DVDs.
 | product/productId: 6302033020 | review/userId: A39IBJB2PBVC7I | review/summary: Sure Cure For Claus-Trophobia | review/text: There is a scene in Reversal Of Fortune where Claus von Bulow, surrounded by a gaggle of well-scrubbed Harvard law students assisting with the case, starts reciting a few of the Claus von Bulow jokes that have cropped up during the trial.  "What do you call the fear of dying from an overdose of insulin --- claus - trophobia."  His delivery is refined, slow, and absolutely flat, no affect.  The look of bemused horror on the faces of the students summarizes all the contradictions of this movie - they simply do not understand the man they're defending.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for this role - he deserved two.  His narration and acting in Brideshead Revisited almost made casting him as Claus von Bulow an inevitability, he seems born to this role.  That he appears so natural on screen is extraordinary because von Bulow is such an odd, complex, and thoroughly detached man.  His veneer is like a lobster's shell, an exoskeleton; he smokes a cigarette with the same precision and care a surgeon would reserve for slicing brain tissue.  It's clear that even a trial will not reveal what makes this man tick, and in the end it doesn't matter, he's just so much fun to watch.<br /><br />Having the film narrated by Sunny was genius, and Glen Close too seems to have inherited this part rather than auditioned for it.  Her looks and delivery are right on point; one wonders how different life in a coma is from life inside a depression fueled by booze and pills.  Alan Dershowitz, played admirably by Ron Silver, provides the junkyard dog energy that fuels the picture - everything about him is in stark contrast to the refined mansions of Rhode Island where even attempted murder must be civilized, polite, and done according to form.<br /><br />Flawless production values put viewers inside the rarified atmosphere, not just wealth, but wealth that has had time to age and grow soft with decadence.  Few things please us more than when things go horribly wrong for the super-rich.  This film satisfies on so many levels.
 | product/productId: 5554462022 | review/userId: AQQLWCMRNDFGI | review/summary: A powerful version of an epic | review/text: This is a breathtaking movie on several levels.  One, the scenery is stunning.  Two, the pace of action is unrelenting.  Third, there is considerable emotional wallop to the movie. Fourth, characters are drawn in such a way as to create real interest in the unfolding drama. Fifth, the sound track, by Randy Edelman, is most affecting.<br /><br />In some senses, the movie is "over the top."  Some of the heroic deeds by, for example, Nathaniel, are almost unbelievable (firing two muskets simultaneously while on the run and hitting two antagonists).  Other scenes could also be adduced in like manner.  But, in a larger sense, it does not really matter.  This is a larger than life film.<br /><br />The three way relationship between Nathaniel (Natty Bumppo, the Pathfinder, "La longue carabine," etc.: Played by Daniel Day-Lewis), his adoptive father Chingachgook (played by AIM leader Russell Means in a compelling manner), and the latter's natural son, Uncas, is well played.<br /><br />There is a great villain, Magua.  There is the ambiguous French general, Montcalm.  Was he complicit with Magua in the massacre after the fort's surrender?  Or was he an unwitting dupe to the latter's vengeance?  The scenes between the two of them are interesting, in that it is not clear at the end where Montcalm stands.<br /><br />There are the dual love stories: the ill-fated proto-relationship between Uncas and General Munro's young daughter Alice; the more mature, slowly developing relationship between Nathaniel and Alice's older sister, Cora.<br /><br />The action scenes, from the siege of the fort, to the massacre of the English troops, to the final conflict, with Chingachgook getting revenge, are compelling and well staged.<br /><br />Whenever I watch this movie, I am overcome by an array of emotions as the drama unfolds.  I am not so concerned with some of the issues regarding the Director's cut as others are.  Whichever version one sees, it will be a fine theatrical event.  I recommend this unhesitatingly as a fine work.

I disagree strongly with the reviewer who said &quot;nothing worked&quot; in it. The acting was superb, and the filming was beautiful and haunting. Many images from the film have stuck  with me - watching it was like visiting another world.  My only complaint  is that I didn't completely understand the ending; it felt a bit  unfinished.  But it is well-made and a very thought provoking movie. I  recommend it to anyone who likes films that are a bit unusual and are  driven more by character than by fast action.

The movies is a hybrid of the concert and fantasy sequences that the band filmed themselves.<br /><br />I have watched this movie over and over again. the music is of course awesome...and some of the songs are played better live than they are on the original albums....the particular song that comes to mind is "The Rain Song". the fantasy sequence in the rain song is amazing too. Other songs they play include "Since I've been loving You", "Dazed and Confused", "Stairway to Heaven" & "Rock and Roll". A must have for any Led head!
 | product/productId: 0783226039 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: Spartacus | review/text: This rousing epic was disowned by Kubrick after a contentious, difficult production, but "Spartacus" still offers grand-scale entertainment, thanks to bold, sure-handed direction and a powerhouse cast. The brawny, clench-jawed Douglas shines in his signature role, while Olivier is suitably poisonous as the cold-blooded Crassus. Other notables include the rotund Peter Ustinov providing comic relief as a cowardly slave-trader, and Charles Laughton, who lends gravitas as a senior Roman senator. If you're craving generous portions of spectacle and sweep, here's your movie.
 | product/productId: 0800142039 | review/userId: A2LLWO2030A41A | review/summary: My favorite :) | review/text: Most everyone who knows me knows that I am obsessed with Little Women.  It is my favorite book (I don't dare to review THAT because I know I will rant on and on about its awesomeness and bore everyone to tears), I wrote all my college essays about its impact on me and I've read it about three or four times a year since I was nine, so I may be a bit biased in saying this is the best film I've ever seen, but hear me out...<br /><br />First of all, I think the casting was almost perfect, especially with Winona Ryder as Jo, Christian Bale as Laurie, and Susan Sarandon as Marmee (though I was somewhat traumatized after I saw her in the Rocky Horror Picture Show a few years after I first viewed this film): they were very believable in their roles and they made me laugh, listen carefully to their words of wisdom, and cry when they experienced hardship.  Secondly, the plot moves fast but doesn't miss capturing the spirit of the scenes that echo those from the book (ex: Jo's anger after discovering Amy has burned her manuscript).  Thirdly, the necessity of deleting some of the book's content carried out by the film makers didn't seem off-putting at all to me -- very few scenes that I really admired were passed over. Fourth, the edition of new content was enjoyable (Ex: couples kissing tenderly or passionately rather than hinting darkly of romance in such a way that the reader doesn't always know how far the feelings run -- one thing that always bothered me was the lack of courtship between John and Meg before she accepted his proposal: she seemed to enjoy rejecting him too much at first to have feelings rooted too deep at that point): Louisa May Alcott's book was largely autobiographical and she based Jo off of her own experiences, so the idea of having this Jo write her experiences into a novel entitled Little Women seemed perfect in my eyes.<br /><br />I see that some reviewers seem to prefer the earlier adaptations of the novel: personally this is the only one I've ever seen, though if I had a chance (or the funds) to get my hands on the others I'd snap them up in a second: hard to imagine the film any better, but I am totally open to possibilities.

The special effects are long in the tooth from todays ultra modern effects labratory's quality.<p>Delos is the entertainment resort of tommorrow. Perhaps ideas for Star Trek's Data character came from here. Robots inhabit 3 different "Worlds" of entertainment for tired and weary businessmen and women.<p>Westworld is where Yul Brenner is, and this is the Wild West. Very cool ! You can shoot and drink and even fool around with pleasure robots and no one actually gets hurt. If you try to shoot at another guest your gun will not work.<p>Medieval World is for those who want to be knights and kings, and looks fun with all its handmaidens.<p>Roman World is the height of decadent behavior.<p>Now with all this good fun, what could possibly go wrong ?<p>Watch this movie and you will check all your friends hands for little circles to see if they are real or not !<p>They made a sequal of this one for those who do not know called Futureworld, which features a more sinister plot of copying people in positions of power and replacing them with robots.<p>Westworld is much more honest and just tryin to give the people clean good fun. Too bad no one told the robots !<p>A fun movie to watch, remember its age though so your not disappointed by outdated special effects and those awful polyester clothing styles of the 70's.<p>Elliot Gould very much in his normal role and character, if your a fan of his, he is the star of the movie who unravels what went wrong.
 | product/productId: 5554821545 | review/userId: A1C2P5HX5RLPAX | review/summary: A Family at War... | review/text: This is an incredibly moving film about a family of four (soon to be five) who moves to the country from London in hopes of having a better life. There's Tom, the younger teenage brother, played by Freddie Cunliffe who is depressed and angry that he was forced to leave his friends behind. Because of the extra time on his hands he's able to see things within his family he never noticed before.<br /><br />There's Jessie, played by Lara Belmont, who plays the eldest daughter. She's sad, withdrawn and sexually promiscuous with both men and women. She's very close with her baby brother, Tom, and at times you wonder if their relationship is inappropriate.<br /><br />Mum (Tilda Swinton), is having another baby, and hasn't been able to sleep. She's frustrated and wanting to go back to work. Dad (Ray Winstone), appears on the surface to be a loyal and loving husband and father.<br /><br />This is a devastating story about incest and how each member deals with it (but specifically Tom). Tom is the first to discover what is going on between his sister and father. I really didn't know for sure from the beginning but looking back all the signs were obvious. Tom confronts his sister who denies it at first. He blames her viciously at first taking out his anger on her instead of his father. They continue to keep it quiet but Tom begins to fear, once the baby Alice is born, that she'll be Dad's next victim.<br /><br />This film was well written, acted and filmed. While it is an emotional caustic topic it is something that shouldn't be hidden behind locked doors and I think well made films like this The War Zone encourage discussion. It is definitely worth watching. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.

I'm really glad I did. While it doesn't get my heart pounding, it is a good workout if you just need to move around. I  work out almost daily, so I use this one twice a week to keep my workouts  fun. The choreography is good -- the cueing could use some work, but once  you've done it a few times, it's not too hard to keep up with the changes.  The group she has is enthusiastic, and the music is really upbeat. I would  recommend this video for anyone looking to break the monotony of the weekly  workout schedule.

 | product/productId: 6301977874 | review/userId: A26UW8DNN74AGK | review/summary: Antonioni On Acid | review/text: This film is sometimes painful to watch, for anyone who outlived the 'sixties - Antonioni apparently didn't.  Whatever contacts the great Italian had in the States before he decided to visit, he was obviously met  by the wrong people at the airport (the Peploe's, please take note).  Antonioni lost his cool, since he decided this time to take sides in the  imaginary war of the generations (can you guess which side he was on?). One  of cinema's most substantial careers came off the rails with this film, and  Hollywood wasn't interested in underwriting further counter-culture  attacks, no matter how stylish or symbolic.  After a few ambitious but  abortive projects, Antonioni finally made the quite unassuming thriller The  Passenger, whether or not he intended profound meaning behind it or not.  Zabriskie Point remains a cult classic, for all those for whom the sixties  never ended.  To quote Roger Daltry (I think), &quot;Anyone who remembers  the '60s wasn't there.&quot; But one question still preponderates: whatever  became of Daria Halprin and Mark Frechette?

 | product/productId: 5555297432 | review/userId: A2C63L2TFNY44V | review/summary: Hypocrisy On Rand's Part | review/text: I was a student of Ayn Rand's philosophy and a patient of Mr. Branden's several decades ago, in the early 70's. Why? Because I was trying in vain to live as Ms. Rand said we should: as heroic figures every day, perfect in our morals, that we should aspire to be as perfect as the impossibly perfect,cold, robotic main characters of her novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shugged. The only book of hers I read several times was We The Living as the characters were most like flesh and blood and real.<br /><br />While I was going to Group at Mr. Branden's house I had no idea that he'd had an affair with Ayn Rand as it was apparently known only to some insiders I'd guess. Had I known, I would have immediately ended the relationship. As it was he was totally ineffectual as a therapist, barely able to stay awake while we spoke, and like comic shrinks in movies, lets you answer your own questions when you're paying HIM to! Years later, 15 free minutes with Dr. Laura on the radio fixed the problem I had (guilt over the death of a family member.)<br /><br /> The upside of all this:I did know Patrecia who was changed to another fictional woman in the movie. She was a Goddess. All the men loved her, all  the women wanted to BE her. She was the essence of joy and life and she died way too young....slight epilepsy that was caused by strobing sunlight dancing off the pool whereupon she had a seizure and fell into the water, drowning.<br /><br />Now I see that the high moral standards we underlings were supposed to uphold were completely tossed out the window by Ms. Rand and Mr. Branden. Barbara Brandon's book also reported that Ms. Rand was often under the influence of some seriously strong amphetamines and I'm sure if she saw I had done the same thing , she'd have blasted me for not having the moral courage to go through life without artificial courage.<br /><br />I admire Ms. Rand for her works and her diligent fight against Communism (she is reeling in her grave at where our country stands now!), but it turned out to be do as I say, not as I do. I wasted a lot of years trying to be what she thought we should all aspire to. We can't. It's an impossibility. We are human, with human frailties which she and Nathaniel obviously both succumbed to. You just can't change Nature, which Ayn hated because she only loved that which was man-made.

It is much larger and has webbing in between its leg tentacles. The egg this face hugger came from was either carried by the queen and or laid by her at the end of Aliens. She doesn't need her egg sack to lay eggs, its just for extra protection for the eggs as they drop out. She could have even carried the egg containing the super-hugger on her back tentacle spikes, and left it on the drop ship(It never shows her from the back in Aliens until after she drops from hiding). Anyways, even though it is not fully explained in the movie, the script states that this super-hugger has the ability to lay a queen embryo in a host AND a warrior protector alien to defend her as she grows to her full size to lay eggs. So this super-hugger is unique and can produce 2 aliens instead of just the one. I know there are a lot of holes in this plot to cover, but this seems to be the most talked about one. Also, it takes days longer for the alien to pop out of Ripley because Alien Queens take much longer to grow before having all components to function on there own, without the warmth of a host. Hope this helps you understand the beggining. Not the best movie either, but light years ahead of Alien Ressurection.

I can already hear all the "not helpful" votes clicking my way, but I have to call it as I see it.  Two hours and sixteen minutes is way too long for whimsical gangsters and a sentimental bag lady.  And on the latter point, Bette Davis' performance is so understated and generic that one wonders why they didn't save the money and simply hire a capable female character actor to play Apple Annie (uggh, and that name).<br /><br />The film isn't intensely bad, just mostly dull and forced, peppered only occasionally with genuine chuckles or moving bits of drama.  And I think the Amazon reviewer who said a scene was missing might be right: all of a sudden the mayor, governor, and the other bigwigs show up at the end to help Annie after we previously saw them refuse Dave the Dude (uggh, that name) and his pleadings to help Annie.<br /><br />Positives?  The widescreen print is sharp and clear, the colors are bright, and the sound is good.  No extras to speak of, though, except for a trailer featuring the inexplicable appearance of variety show host Ed Sullivan, who talks up the movie (he must have had a financial interest in it).<br /><br />It's a shame that this was the great Frank Capra's last film.  It wasn't so bad that it would have prevented him from doing something else after it, so it's unfortunate that this marginal effort was his swan song.

 | product/productId: 6302363284 | review/userId: ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV | review/summary: Astaire, Garland, Irving Berlin, and Movie Magic | review/text: Originally intended as a re-teaming of Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, EASTER PARADE ran into trouble when Garland's doctors advised against her working under the direction of her husband, director Vincent Minnelli--and no sooner did director Charles Walters take the helm than Gene Kelly broke his leg.  Out of such confusion are movie musical miracles born: although a bit old to act as Garland's leading man, Fred Astaire was coaxed out of retirement.  He and Garland had tremendous chemistry, EASTER PARADE was a box office smash, and Astaire unexpectedly found himself reborn as an MGM star.<p>Set in 1900s New York, the film's story line is flimsy but enjoyable.  After long-time dance partner Ann Miller abandons the act, Astaire hires chorus girl Garland and attempts to recast her in his former partner's mold--a situation which offers Astaire and Garland considerable comedy and gives Astaire the chance to parody several of his own famous dance of the 1930s.  Garland eventually convinces Astaire that she needs to be herself, and once the act is revamped they become a hot ticket--and, once their several romantic complications are resolved, romantic partners as well.<p>Astaire is every bit as charming here as he was in his Ginger Roger days, and his choreography retains his signature sharpness, wit, and elegance.  Although Garland isn't really a dancer, she holds her own with Astaire and she tears strips off a brillant score of Irving Berlin favorites.  Both are well supported by Anne Miller, who gives a brilliant turn with 'Shakin' the Blues Away,' and Peter Lawford, who is quite charming as one of Garland's admirers.  Although this really isn't as inspired as the truly great MGM musicals of the late 1940s, director Walters keeps it going at a smart pace, and the star power, clever script, memorable score, and those legendary MGM production values elevate it well above the pack.  Musical fans will be in for a treat!  Recommended.

Most of the folks I spoke to fell into one or two categories. They either loved the movie or hated it. I, on the other hand, had more ambivalent feelings. IMHO the first movie was much better. Though, Apocalypse does have some redeeming qualities...mainly the dead dogs are back in action. There is nothing better then zombie canines.<br /><br />The movie picks up where the last left off. T-virus has spread and chaos reigns all over Raccoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation is doing all it can to contain the virus, but it's spreading faster then anyone could imagine. In an effort to study the disease, and keep it from spreading, the corporation has sealed off the city. It's then that the real action begins.<br /><br />Resident Evil is full of action. There a lot of things blowing up, bullets flying, and plenty of people dying and re-animating. Not to mention, there is a huge terminator-esque bio-weapon running around.<br /><br />I didn't find the movie too trying. But, overall the entire venture was short on plot. Events, people and circumstances were left virtually unexplained. Most of the acting was sub-par and just when you think the movie is over it starts off with another crazy hypothesis. It's like the neverening story...and I mean this truly.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie more then three stars, but it just doesn't deserve it. Though, the soundtrack is again superb Milla J. returns as Alice. That in it of itself is worth something.

The star-studded, ironic (Tim Allen (voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Sigourney Weaver (from the "Alien" movies) lead the way) and burnt-out cast of the fictional sci-fi TV show "Galaxy Quest" find themselves on a real-life mission when aliens visit the earth.

 | product/productId: 0783227752 | review/userId: A2V8PN2XD7ZLU6 | review/summary: Death Takes a Holiday:  Meet Joe Black | review/text: I first saw this movie in the theatre because at that point in time I'd have gone to see anything starring Brad Pitt.  What a revelation the movie turned out to be!  Pitt's performance blew me away.  I wouldn't have given odds that he could hold his own against mega-talent Anthony Hopkins, but it was a match made in Heaven.  The basic story line is that Hopkins' character, a successful man who is the head of a powerful corporation as well as of a close-knit family, is having symptoms of an incipient heart attack.  Pitt, who plays "Death", takes the body of a young man, and decides to strike a deal...he will delay Hopkins' demise, and in exchange he will be a guest in Hopkins home and world.  Death wants to experience human life. Before Death makes an appearance, Pitt (as the young man whose body is later co-opted by Death) meets Hopkins' favorite daughter in a random way, over coffee, and both experience strong instant attraction.  When Pitt (no longer the very human young man but a remote and other-worldly essence who is using his body) shows up at her father's house during a family dinner, her confusion is tempered by the fact she still is attracted...but now wonders what happened to the likable guy she'd met earlier.<br />  Brad Pitt's dual portrayals; first of the charming and good-natured guy in the coffee shop, then contrasted with the very non-human consciousness of "death" masquerading as a human being is nothing short of astonishing.  This was the movie that convinced me Brad Pitt could really ACT.  He is utterly different as each character, although in both he is outwardly a very attractive young man in a business suit.  It's in his eyes that you see the shattering difference...and realize when you look into them that there is nothing human looking out, as "Death".  I remember being awestruck in the theatre, and thinking, "Where did he PULL that from????"  How does one develop a character that is essentially inhuman, immortal and still frighteningly beautiful?  It was a masterful job of acting!<br />  Anthony Hopkins, as the man whose remaining life is under the control of Death, is brilliant, as always.  In his role as a father, a corporate leader, and then as a father fighting for the life of his daughter (Death has fallen in love with his daughter, and she with him; Hopkins must make Death develop human love and morality, in order to convince him not to "take her with me" when they depart for Death's true domain)...he uses all the talent and skills we expect of him.  His portrayal is achingly human and rises to our highest expectations.<br />  Along with a stunning supporting cast..each character fully developed and unerringly portrayed...I always thought this movie didn't get half the buzz it deserved.  It's one I will happily watch again and again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783233477">Meet Joe Black</a>
 | product/productId: 630208735X | review/userId: A3KBEOB8NO9RAL | review/summary: A disappointing adaptation of an excellent book | review/text: After reading and rereading the book &quot;Flight of the Intruder,&quot; at some point I became curious enough to actually watch the movie.  Unfortunately, the movie did not at all live up to what I wanted to see.  Understandably, a novel has to be boiled down in order to translate into a movie of acceptable length, but in this case, nothing but a skeleton remains, and the movie utterly failed to engross me like the book did.  <p>The book is full of well-formed characters; the movie sports cliched actors spitting lines, occasionally interjecting good one-liners from the book; at least, they were good in the book.  In the movie, they don't have the same effect.  In the book, when Cole refers to himself as &quot;naturally blabby,&quot; it's amusing because of what the reader knows about Cole.  In the movie, the irony simply does not show through.  The muddy characterization fits in well with the muddy nature of the movie.  Surely this could have been done better.<p>And, finally, the crowning touch of everything- the movie completely twists the plot of the book around.  The movie basically reduces the primary plot to Grafton and Camparelli deciding that they like each other after all (after Grafton saves Camparelli's life- awwwww...).  The final scenes are cheesier than the entire state of Wisconsin, in stark contrast with the suspenseful final pages of the book.<p>Perhaps this movie would be enjoyable for a viewer who has not read the book; unfortunately, I cannot view it that way.  For anyone who has read the book and loved it, I suspect that they will feel the same utter disappointment when the closing credits of the movie roll, at least if they stay awake that long (I actually fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it).

It is a movie in the tradition of 48 Hrs and Lethal Weapon, and like those two movies, it has perfect casting. Chris Tucker is hysterical in his best performance since Friday, Jackie Chan is in top form, complete with incredible stunts, cool martial arts and hilarious broken English. <p>The story is well-written and full of funny situations for both Tucker and Chan. Look for the scenes where Chan is in a predominantly black pool hall and Tucker buys some Chinese food from a cart. The chemistry between the two leads is probably what makes this movie so great. Great individually, but even better together. All this makes Rush Hour a guaranteed good time.
 | product/productId: 0783113315 | review/userId: A1OX82JPAQLL60 | review/summary: Not a Documentary but a Commentary | review/text: This movie fails to be the documentary based on "true story" but a commentary by the director and actors which fails to provide the essential Lewis story.<br /><br />What is left out primarily is his faith life, which was vital to him, and he wrote about till the end. It is analogous to making film about Tiger Woods with golf as not being featured as central theme.  It was not shaken nor destroyed as this movie makes out.  The BBC film which proceeded this, thus is far more accurate than this.  Hopkins' interpreation of Lewis as isolated in tower and afraid to take on debate is also inaccurate.  His relationship with Joy is also inaccurate in many ways.<br /><br />Three stars for with all this Hollywood inaccuracy, many are motivated to seek out real Lewis is his writings and thus discover this fine, intelligent Christian.

It's saving grace is Meryl Streep and the performance she gives, culminating in the beautiful, harrowing scene where she makes her 'decision'.<br />However, ultimately this movie still feels slumped by its messy script and very often (particularly at the start) it can almost feel as though it's a play we're watching, all the action contained to a few rooms, interspersed with flask-backs.

Awful. It was somewhat enjoyable for its camp value, but it's still too long for that. I watched the first two thirds then gave up on it.<br /><br />The fun parts were the shocking for the time use of nudity and primitive gore. Also, Udo Kier as Baron Frankenstein shouts all his lines. His sidekick Otto spends the entire movie popping out his eyes looking surprised. The Baron's sister/wife (they didn't seem to be clear which she was) reminded me heavily of Shelly Long and the kids were clones of Wednesday and Pugsly Addams. My favorite part was that the entire cast spoke with a stew of European accents, then along comes Andy Warhol's boy-toy Joe Dallesandro sounding like he just climbed out of a New York cab.<br /><br />If you have a group of drunken friends or see the movie listed as a midnight show at a theater, it could be fun. But to actually sit and watch it as a film, I just couldn't.

 | product/productId: 0790731258 | review/userId: A13910TC3NZ6LE | review/summary: An Interesting Study of Jury Nullification | review/text: There's a phenomenon in the law known as &quot;jurynullification&quot;, which means that even though a person istechnically guilty of a crime, a jury will refuse to convict a defendant if it feels the motive was proper.  Basically, that's the premise of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, John Grisham's first and best novel.  <p>I note that one previous reviewer (the British gentleman who claims to have studied law) wrote a rather scathing review of the movie.  Apparently he feels that this sort of thing can't take place in an American courtroom.  Having been an attorney for some eight years now, I can tell you that it can and does!  <p>The big screen version, directed by Joel Schumacher, is right up there with Francis Ford Coppola's direction of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; as the best and most faithful adaptation of a Grisham novel into a movie.  <p>If I have any problem with this movie, it's that Sondra Bullock (who's star was on the rise at the time this movie was being made) got top billing.  Anyone who's read the novel can tell you that her character is a rather minor one, and the major figure of this movie is Jake Brigance, portrayed with distinction by a relative unknown (at that time) by the name of Matthew McConaughey.  Ashley Judd turns in a fine performance as his wife, and Kevin Spacey is his usual excellent self as the DA.  Samuel L. Jackson was also well cast as the anguished father who avenged his daughter.<p>Although there are some detractors who say that this movie glorifies vigilante justice, I would say that they're missing the point.  The point is that we as a society have gotten to the point where we will occasionally excuse a person from otherwise criminal conduct if we agree that his motive was pure.  The irony in it all is that those who committed crimes against blacks in the early days of the civil rights movement in the American South often escaped accountability by the very same means.

Wodehouse once admitted that his little comedies existed in a sort of post-Edwardian never, never land where evil couldn't get much further than occasional outbreaks of bad manners. Much the same might be said of E. M. Forster's little Edwardian universe that is explored in this film. A pretty, intelligent, but inexperienced girl finds herself in the incredible beauty of Florence and the spectacular Tuscan summer. She meets a young man who somehow, despite hardly ever saying anything, manages to be the distillation of the Romantic. He falls in love with her and gives her one of the great leaves-you-tingling-all-over kisses in all the movies. She reacts by retreating at full speed into an engagement to the dullest man in the English-speaking world. But, even without Jeeves, things come out right in the end. Even the minor characters are brilliantly cast and performed. The sound track with, I think, Kiri Te Kanawa is enough to levitate the furniture. I wish I could remember who said, &quot;There's a better universe next door -- let's go!&quot; He must have been taking about this one!

From the opening moments of a busted up appartment (at the hands of 'Ray', the drunk-up pops) I was 'hooked on Redhook'.  I have now seen it 13 times--more than any other movie.  Matty Rich directed, wrote--done everything in this movie!<br />But you know? The show belongs to Dennis (Larry Gillard, Jr.) and Ray (George T. Odom--watch for him as the bartender in &quot;The Hurricane&quot;).  When Ray's talkin' to the mirror... i'm feelin it.<br />I liked this movie so much, me and my boy was gonna do a remake of it, but it never happened... maybe one day...<br />Highlights of the movie include the scene where Dennis and Ray chat about life, forgotten dreams, and gettin OUT... also watch for the love scene with Sherley (which is sure to steam up your goggles) and the dance sequence where Dennis shows his moves with those crazy nut-caeshe friends of his.<br />You can't step to this movie. Now turn the lights down low, the volume full blast, and hit that owl like it was a party horn.
 | product/productId: 079070546X | review/userId: AMG2LF8MLUDN1 | review/summary: A very Griswold Christmas | review/text: The poor Griswold family just can't seem to get anything quite right.  Full of family problems and egg nog, I must agree with some of my fellow reviewers that this is the best of the Griswold series.  There are some real laugh out loud moments here.  It's a zany romp through one family's Christmas holiday.<br /><br />All Clark Griswold wants is to have a good old fashioned Christmas holiday with the family.  What he gets is a tree that's too big for the house, an over crowded house full of both sets of grandparents, an unwelcome cousin and his family, a big dog, a crazy squirrel, a mean old uncle and his forgetful wife, a dead cat, a trashed house, a kidnapped boss, an invasion by a<br /><br />swat team, and an explosion, just to name a few items.<br /><br />Parents beware, there is a small amount of profanity.  There is no nudity or sexual content.  There is some mild violence.  While I didn't rate this one with 5 stars, I still believe that it is worthy of having a place in your Christmas dvd collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!
 | product/productId: 6300214826 | review/userId: A26IVJJTXOE85B | review/summary: One of the best ever | review/text: A black ops assassin is sent into the jungles of South East Asia to hunt down and kill a one-time career military golden boy who has turned renegade and began operating outside of the chain of command. Francis Ford Coppola's dream-like journey through the horrors and absurdities of the Vietnam war, like 2001: A Space Odyssey before it, is more an experience than a story with any kind of strict middle, beginning and end. It's not the destination that's important. It's chock full of memorable performances from Martin Sheen's Willard who becomes fascinated with his target and shares more in common with him than he'd like to admit, through to Brando's towering presence as the rarely seen, shadow enshrouded god of war who has tired of the hypocritical "rules of engagement". Not forgetting Kilgore, who despite the long and illustrious career of Robert Duvall, will always be the character he is remembered for and the Ride Of The Valkyries sequence is one of the all-time greats of cinema. It has so many haunting, nightmarish images and the whole film is absolutely stunning to look at from beginning to end. The first time I'm seen it since viewing the ill-conceived Redux version, this is a much better cut although come the finale, I couldn't shake the feeling that something (it escapes me what exactly) was missing. Some may be left bemused by the rather free-form approach but it is certainly the most creative and provocative war film ever made.
 | product/productId: 0790741512 | review/userId: A3QEJ40NQEW36Q | review/summary: The perfect example of action serving story. | review/text: There are a lot of loud, whining engines in THE ROAD WARRIOR.  There are people being killed, maimed and immolated.  Of the characters who survive this tale, very few come through without scars.<p>It's a post-apocalyptic nightmare where hope fights despair.  The irony of Max's character is that even though he's one of the good guys, he's probably the most desperate of the lot.  This is the tale of Max's pain and how he rose above it to become a legend.<p>This is not the same Max we saw in MAD MAX.  This Max has been poisoned by tragedy and loss, and the anger of the past has refined into a tiny hard ball of self-involvement.  It seems fitting that civilization fell so soon after Max suffered his losses--almost as though when Max lost his place in the world, the world changed to find a new place for him.<p>THE ROAD WARRIOR touches on one aspect of the end-of-the-world scenario that has always fascinated me:  if the world ends, how many of the survivors will know how and why it happened?<p>These people don't have time to contemplate that--the once-civilized world has become an enormous hunting ground where the prize is the precious little bit of gasoline that remains.  With the world in shambles, the only things left for most people to do are eat, make love, drive really fast, and die.  In the midst of all these lost souls, one small group has manufactured hope by restarting a refinery and producing enough gasoline to allow them to escape to a better place.<p>THE ROAD WARRIOR is so far removed from the fallen civilized world it replaced that we don't even get a sense that any of these people even remember what the world was like before.  We haven't got a clue what any of them did prior to the fall.  (Yes, we know Max was a policeman, but we know that from MAD MAX--it's never really touched upon, here.)  In THE ROAD WARRIOR, the conflict has been distilled to an abstraction, with the good guys as desperate in their Hope as the bad guys are desperate in their Despair.<p>It catches you up from the beginning, rocking your screen and your sensibilities with high-speed stuff that, for once, isn't mindless.  How long can you survive in a world where people are willing to kill you for whatever gasoline remains in the tank of your car?  You bet you'd run, and run fast and hard.  It's a horribly Darwinistic world where the desire to hold on to some small facet of the past drives people to lives so pointless they don't even bother to ask why they're living this way.  Heaven help you if you actually want to take the tools of the past and use them to build a real future.<p>This is, no question, a 5-star movie in my mind, but it's a 4-star DVD--the print used for the transfer is grainy, and it seems like the illumination was inconsistent.  The whole thing feels a bit washed-out.  Special features?  What's that?  For a legendary film like this, it's criminal not to have given us substantial bonus material.
 | product/productId: 6300208907 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: The last of John Wayne's early westerns for Lone Star | review/text: &quot;Paradise Canyon&quot; is the last of the sixteen B Westerns that a young John Wayne made for poverty row studio Monogram's Lone Star division between 1933 and 1935.  Directed by Carl Pierson, the first of three cheap Westerns the long time film editor directed, you need to know right from the start that they did not save the best for last in this series despite the promise of the tagline: &quot;The fight at Robber's Roost...It Teems With Action!&quot;  But Wayne did well enough to move on after this one to Republic Pictures, where eventually he would encounter John Ford, make &quot;Stagecoach,&quot; and become the iconic actor of the American western film genre.<p>Once again John Wayne is playing an undercover good guy, this time named John Wyatt who joins the medicine show of Doc Carter (Earle Hodgins) as a sharpshooter in an effort to find some counterfeiters along the Mexican border in Arizona (It it just me or does counterfeiting sound overly ambitious for the Wild West?  How many opportunities are there to find change for a fake $100, $20 or whatever in these towns?).  Wyatt is suspicious of the Doc but it turns out the bad guy is really Curly Joe Gale (legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt), who is not only the counterfeiter but also found time in his criminal past to frame Curly Joe (it is a decidedly small world in these Westerns).  This is helpful because Wyatt has taken a liking to Doc's daughter, Linda (Marion Burns), billed as Princess Natasha in Wyatt's shooting act.  <p>If you have been following the Lone Star series there are really few surprises here in terms of the plot.  If you can frame one person for counterfeiting you can frame another person. The twist on this one is that the Duke's character has to cross the border to pursue Curly Joe and rescue Doc and Linda.  Not surprisingly, our hero has as many problems with law enforcement south of the border as he does on this side.  Then there is the question of why a story about counterfeiting with a canyon in the title ends up having the climax in an old mine.  &quot;Paradise Canyon&quot; also has the diversion of Perry Murdock and Gordon Clifford singing as the Texas Two, but that is not really enough to get this one up to the level of being an average Lone Star oater.  I would not recommend that a John Wayne fan endure all sixteen of these early efforts, but the first dozen or so did have not only the Duke and Canutt but George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes, which always helps.

An actual apex of film making, as only a French guy could bring.<br /><br />And let me attest to this now: It's been BROUGHT!<br /><br />LEON is probably my favorite movie of all time, but this movie just goes off in directions that no other film has gone before. I have now idea how this film can be so funny, so tragic, so inspiring, and so sad all at the same time, but it does, and it does it well.<br /><br />Do you know what I'm most thankful for? That they didn't make a sequel. I (usually) really hate sequels, and a sequel to this would have blown. If you've seen Starship Troopers 2, then you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />So what would Marc Antony do? DUH! He'd drop Cleopatra like a small pox scab and run off with Mila Jovivic!

 | product/productId: 0790734060 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: Amedeus | review/text: A marvelously acted, flawlessly directed story about jealousy, obsession, and perfectionism, Forman's stunning "Amadeus" mixes suspenseful drama with historical fact to create a winning fictional biography. The lead actors inhabit their roles with gusto, with Hulce's crass talent playing off Abraham's guileful Salieri with great results. Neville Marriner brings Mozart's music to vigorous life. Winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Abraham), "Amadeus" is a triumph that will delight anyone with a soft spot for cracked genius.
 | product/productId: 6300269310 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: Jack Lemmon's sobering portrait of an alcoholic | review/text: I was never really interested in drinking alcohol and after catching &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; on late night television I knew I was never going to drink, never get drunk, and never end up like the character of Joe Clay, played by the late Jack Lemmon.  Joe is in public relations and cannot have a good time unless he is drinking.  He meets up with Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick), and informed she does not drink but loves chocolate, he orders her a Brandy Alexander.  Joe and Kirsten marry, although her father Ellis Arnesen (Charles Bickford), is not sure he approves.  Joe's alcoholism finally costs him his job and by then Kirsten is boozing just as much.  In one of the most ghastly scenes in movie history, Joe destroys the Arnesen greenhouse, looking for the bottles of booze he has buried with one of the plants.  With the help of A.A. Counselor Jim Hungerford (Jack Klugman), Joe finally starts to get his life together.  But Kirsten cannot do the same, even for the sake of their daughter Debbie.<p>With Lemmon's death a lot of his old movies are suddenly popping up on cable television.  I watched &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; again last night and it is every bit as powerful and as horrific as I remember.  No other film has made the life of an alcoholic look so hopeless, not &quot;Leaving Last Vegas&quot; and certainly not &quot;Lost Weekend.&quot;  Lemmon and Remick were both nominated for Oscars for their performances, while Henry Mancini's title song won the Academy Award.  Charles Bickford repeated the role he originated in the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; version aired in 1958, which was directed by James Frankenheimer.  Blake Edwards directed this 1962 movie because the studio told Frankenheimer he could not direct a comedy like this film.  Both scripts were written by J. P. Miller.  Bottom line: Nobody who ever watches this movie will ever forget it.
 | product/productId: 6300135071 | review/userId: A10ODC971MDHV8 | review/summary: Scenes from a Marriage | review/text: Bergman's ambitious, profound chronicle of love, selfishness, regret and missed connections that often characterize matrimony, and indeed, male-female relations. Long and demanding, but richly rewarding, the film's impact lies less in its portrayal of a subtly stagnating union than in the nuanced nature of the couple's interactions after the marriage is over. An Ingmar peak. Stay with this-it's worth it.

For those of us who well remember the mid-70's, this can be a slightly painful film that documents the era well.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is not up to the snuff of other Blu-ray transfers that I have seen. The film is grainy, almost like it was originally 16mm. It may be what there was to work with, but it does not have the crispness and clarity of other transfers. The sound, however, is wonderful, if you liked the music of the era!

I have several copies on DVD and VHS. I was completely floored when I found out that there was a Special Edition coming out with Director Commentary and subtitles because there has always been parts in the movie where I have no clue what Skank and Gutterboy are talking about. Plus Mike Marvin gives a lot of interesting information on the movie. I was totally thrilled learning things I did not know about my favorite movie. It was phenomenal.

 | product/productId: 0783227019 | review/userId: A3CPZKV8KDMROK | review/summary: One of the best gangster movies ever! | review/text: After seeing this movie I was surprised by the superb acting and drama scenes that took place.  I love Luis Guzman in this movie and Al Pacino of course.  I also thought that Penelope Ann Miller did a pretty good job with her part.  This movie is up with Scarface and A Bronx Tale in my opinion b/c it focuses on more than one point throughout the movie.  I was never bored during the whole movie and the climax was tremendous.  The whole scene at the Grand Central Station was exhilirating and even though you already knew what was going to happen you couldn't wait to see how it happened.  At the same time I didn't want to see what would happen.  I love Al Pacino and gangster films 4-life, go rent it!
 | product/productId: 6301971140 | review/userId: A2VUP5US1F5HG5 | review/summary: A PRODUCTION WORTHY OF AN EMPEROR | review/text: Restrained, stately, dramatic, intelligent and powerful--all these adjectives and more apply to "William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar," a genuine triumph not only on the part of director Joseph Mankiewicz (whose command of tone and atmosphere is nearly flawless here) but for the entire cast and crew.  Marlon Brando is justifiably most often singled out for his herculean performance as Mark Antony, and his impassioned speech to the people of Rome, in which he alternately succumbs to grief for Caesar and thirst for power, is Oscar material all on its own.  But the other actors shine too:  Louis Calhern is an arrogant but affable Caesar blind to his encroaching doom as great leaders so often are; James Mason captures the ultimate pathos that Brutus should embody; Deborah Kerr wins my heart if not Brutus's as Portia; and John Gielgud is the oily, corrupt serpent in the midst of the false Eden that was Rome, and almost implodes before our very eyes with envy and frustration.  All in evocative sets that are grand enough to please the eye without distracting from the real drama of brilliant actors portraying a brilliant script.  A must for Shakespeare fans.

Personally I haven't liked a couple of his films so far (Mad Max - apart from the leather trousers) but Braveheart more than makes up for. Yes I know it's cliched, but I love that story! Soppy romantic at heart here, hi!<br /><br />I was not that keen on the first Lethal Weapon movie, but this one was a lot exciting, apart from the South African politics. And Mel's hair. What's worse, that or his hair in Braveheart? Let me ponder that for a while.<br /><br />About half way through - okay, the scene with Danny Glover sitting on the toilet - I realised I'd already seen it many years ago! Back in the *good* old days of high school, when nothing could ever replace video, and my mate and me had nothing better to do that rent Mel Gibson movies. And of course I remembered Miss Wooden, Patsy Kensit. (She's starring in some British TV shows and she still hasn't taken any acting classes.) Her final scene still freaks me out in the film as it does when I was at high school. I still didn't remember that much of it - I definitely didn't remember Joe Pesci's character being that irritating! SIT! STAY!<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 2 is better than the first, and all the better for watching in HD - beats video anyday - but I still feel the ending felt ever so slightly wrong. He was meant to be killed off at the end, and it does feel like he should have been, rather than survive. But I guess the director saw dollar signs before his eyes, and made two more, which according to my boyfriend, sound pretty dismal. There are some scenes for the ladeez of Mel with a certain lack of clothes, so enjoy. And Patsy Kensit for the guys. It's definitely the better of the two.
 | product/productId: 078401132X | review/userId: A1UJAUFLJG8D5I | review/summary: Not Bad | review/text: Not bad considering that Marvel Comics Company did not lend a hand with this film. They did the best with what they had. I think Dolph Lundgren did a great Job portaying the Punisher and in my opinion he should have played the Punisher in the new Punisher Movie instead of Thomas Jane, don't get me wrong Thomas did a good job playing the role of the Punisher, he just did not look enough like the Punisher, Dolph resmbles the punisher a great deal and played the role almost to perfection. But this version of the punisher does have it's faults like for example Dolph's version of the Punisher does not display the Trade Mark Skull on his shirt, and the movie took place in australia instead of New York. But overall the Movie was pretty good considering the lack of help from Marvel. Louis Gossett Jr. also played a good part in this movie, The new Punisher is a little more accurate than this version, but this movie is still a must get and see.

Her name is Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook "Night Skies".) Who will survive at there Final Destination!<br /><br />Review: This film was only slightly over decent! It is definitely better that parts 3 and 4 but it can't compare to the original in the originality concept.... In some aspects though the film is rather cheesy and the guy in the elevators Chewbacca scream isn't exactly the best acting I've seen out of this series! The deaths were good but the special effects were only decent! The soundtrack in my opinion was forgettable but this movie was far gorier than part one! It is definitely a Thriller/Chiller and some scenes will make the hairs on the back of your neck stick way up! I had a good time watching it and I bet you will to!<br /><br />Acting: I didn't know that Chewbacca had a part in this movie.. Oh wait... it's just that guy in the elevator who is screaming because a woman has just been decapitated right in front of his eyes! Now that I have insulted that scene enough I must say that the film's acting isn't terrible but it could've been better especially the mothers reaction to her sons death at the end what can I say... I'm a cruel critic... but I do believe it could've been much more real!<br /><br />Gore: a body chopped into three sections with a barbed wire fence, a decapitation, some burnt/burning bodies, a ladder impaled into someone's eye, a body crushed by a giant glass pane, a head impaled on a spike, a severed arm and some more! Wicked fun, wicked graphic, wicked wickedness!<br /><br />Bottom Line: A good buttery popcorn flick! It does lack some much needed aspects majorly a more original plot and story... but in the end it works!<br /><br />Rated: "R" for strong violent/gruesome accidents, language, drug content and some nudity<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 8<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4

The reason we have all been waiting for this release is due to the poor condition of the original film elements.  For those of you who owned the laserdisc edition, remember that the first reel was plagued with water damage (almost fitting for this type of movie).  Rumor has it that this fine grain master print was the best Fox had available at the time...that the negative was not around...not necessarily lost, just not able to be located.  My buddy tells me that this is no longer the case and that restoration work has been ongoing for the better part of a year on this title.  Hopefully it will be worth the wait.

I usually like Peter Weller, but he phoned in a miserable performance. Of course, he did not have much to work with. I am a five-decade science fiction fan, so I am used to suspension of disbelief. However, I am not used to suspension of all neural activity, which watching this movie requires.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum must have really needed the money to dress up like one of the Village People.<br /><br />Note to the producers: endless jargon does not science fiction make. Good science fiction has good plotting and characters you can like. You might also want to pay a bit of attention to continuity. A movie this confusing is not interesting, just annoying. If you want to see a confusing movie that is intertesting, try "The Big Sleep" with Bogart and Bacall. Of course, William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett were not available to write "Buckaroo Banzai," so I guess you had to settle for whoever showed up for work that morning.<br /><br />Another note to the producers: High-powered rifles and Colt .45 revolvers do not sound like firecrackers when fired.<br /><br />John Lithgow is funny and manic as usual, but he could not salvage this turkey.<br /><br />As icing on the cake, the movie is offensive to Catholics (at least to this Catholic).

 | product/productId: 6300246876 | review/userId: A1C8XB9JR0H7KT | review/summary: This is the Pearl Harbor movie to see. | review/text: Just as I dreaded the prospect of seeing a modern re-make of Psycho, so I dread going to see Pearl Harbor, given the extremely high bar set by its predecessor, Tora Tora Tora.  Let me say right at the outset that I consider this one of the best war films ever made.  Certainly, it has its weaknesses -- there is not the kind of character development you find in a dramatic film such as From Here to Eternity.  Tora Tora Tora is essentially a documentary film, and in that vein it is practically unsurpassed.  The technical accuracy is incredible, especially for a film from the days before computer-generated effects.  Unlike Pearl Harbor, which attempts to pass off Vietnam-era ships as WWII vintage (promotional shots for the movie show the frigate USS Whipple, commissioned in 1971, being bombed by the Japanese in 1941), the ships in Tora Tora Tora accurately depict the ships that were involved in the attack.  They might be miniatures, but at least they're accurate miniatures!  And although the Japanese planes are not authentic -- I believe there are only two authentic Zeros still flying in the world today -- the reproduction planes used in the movie are so convincing that they're still being used in vintage airshows today.  The sets -- including a full-size mock-up of the Japanese battleship Nagato -- are beautifully executed.  And the action sequences are wrenchingly poignant.<p>Part of the enduring appeal of this movie is its balance in depicting very politically sensitive events.  Japanese and American movie makers collaborated on the movie, and as a result the Japanese who participated in the attack are neither glorified nor villified -- just men caught in a momentous historical moment, some enthusiastically and some reluctantly.  Nonetheless, the full infamy of the attack is impressed on the viewer.  Far better to directly and straight-forwardly address these critical aspects of the attack than to avoid or ignore them, which is what I fear may be the case in Pearl Harbor.

It is done with some humor as it should be, because at this point the whole plot is skating on very thin ice! The movie is funny, tragically sad and interesting, just don't think about it too long afterwards. I am a fan of the series and I'm being generous with my rating. The DVD transfer looks great. If your a fan of the series you want them all!

 | product/productId: 630228371X | review/userId: A276M3NSIY9B82 | review/summary: Brother Orchid | review/text: Edward G. Robinson is somewhat cast against type in this film. It has been years since I have seen this movie; it's never been one that has received much exposure via television. It's a real treat to see Robinson take a turn at comedy; something he didn't do often but he had the skills to do it. Brother Orchid was released in 1940 & was directed by Lloyd Bacon. It's presented in the full screen format (1.33:1) & is in black & white.<br /><br />Little John Sarto (Edward G. Robinson) has had enough of the rackets after someone in his Protection Agency has knocked someone off. He decides to retire, go to Europe & get some real class. After five years & broke (he's made some incredibly bad investments), he decides to return to New York City & become the head of his Protection Agency again. His former pals welcome him with open arms but it's only a ploy. Jack Buck (Humphrey Bogart, who was still a couple of years away from superstardom) has him thrown out on his ear. Flo Addams (Ann Sothern in a hilarious role) is his long suffering girlfriend. She appeals to Buck that he & Sarto should make up & become partners again. Buck agrees but it's all a set up in order to eliminate Sarto. The hit fails but just barely. Sarto ends up at a monastery becoming Brother Orchid. Brother Superior (Donald Crisp) takes him on as a monk with some funny consequences, everything has an angle & a hustle to Sarto. After hiding in the monastery for a few months Sarto reads that Flo is going to marry a hick cowboy from Montana, Clarence Fletcher (Ralph Bellamy). Fletcher had already been in some scenes earlier in the movie. The scene where he's driving Flo & Sarto to the sanitarium to get Willie the Knife (Allen Jenkins) is a riot, he's doing bird calls while Flo & Sarto are in the backseat talking. Ralph Bellamy made a living out of playing the "other guy" who never gets the girl. I don't know for sure but this might be the only movie where Bellamy DID get the girl! I won't spoil the ending for you but it's really a change of pace for Eddie G.!<br /><br />There are some bonus features on the disc. There's an audio commentary track & several short subjects: A vintage newsreel,"Henry Busse & His Orchestra" (musical short); two cartoons, "Busy Bakers" (color) & "Slap Happy Pappy" (b&w Porky Pig) & two trailers, one of Brother Orchid & one of It All Came True. The film restoration is excellent as is the audio track.
 | product/productId: 5555273649 | review/userId: A1EPQDXGRHZIP5 | review/summary: Biss, healing, growth | review/text: I think that people who bough or want to watch this movie are prone to learn something about themselves, their sexuality, and their intimacy, unless, that is, they do not know anything about the film. But most of us who bought it knew something about the film already. And I believe it is a good bias, relevant nevertheless.<br />This film makes you think, it makes you want to go deeper within yourself, it is not purely entertainment, although the acting is good, compassionate and believable. For people who may be looking for a sex-based movie that will put the perfect touch of spice on a date this movie will not work. For those who want to know more about themselves and their relationships this movie presents a very refreshing and important approach.<br />I watched this movie in the theatre around 1998, in Barcelona, where I am from (it was titled "El Amor Es Extasis"). I don't remember exactly why it caught my attention, but I do remember that I was facing several challenging issues in intimacy. I guess I read the synopsis and fell drawn to it... I loved it, it really changed the way I thought about sex, as well as intimacy. Ten years later I find myself in a situation very similar to the one in the movie and I did everything I could to find it. I needed to watch it again. I saw it in Spanish and I didn't know any actors, so it was hard to find this movie in its original English title. But I found it!!<br />I watched it again and loved it even more, I guess it is more relevant than ever. But don't  get me wrong, this is not a movie to help you heal your traumatized partner but to personally expand your horizons about your own sexuality and intimacy and grow as a person, and thus within and with your relationship.<br />I am not a movie critic but I find the movie quite low-budget, nothing fancy about the way it's been filmed and whatnot. You are not watching Blue Planet here. The movie is about the message it carries and the wisdom-filled script, and the acting, again, pays tribute to its message.<br />I personally started to look more introspectively, learning more about intimacy, about my own issues that are preventing me to be the sexual and intimate being I can fully be, and without even noticing I have changed the way I see women in general. I am even more attracted to them I was before but more meaningfully. Sex is over-marketed and is misleading everyone, both women and men, which is causing (together with ever-changing gender roles in society) intimacy relationship be handicapped. Men see a woman passing by and we can't help to be attracted, which is normal, we are designed for it, but the attraction is translated immediately to sexual desires... And the truth is that women, as well as men, are much more than sexual beings. This movie reminded me that it is through sex and intimacy that we can really get to touch one's core as well as ours, and I guess that at this moment in my life I am ready to not explore my core but expose it and share it with someone who is able to do the same, I am ready for a sexually rich and meaningful intimate relationship.<br />It is important to differentiate sex from intimacy. Sex can be good and uncompromising, satisfactory at the least. But intimacy is deeper, has to be opened, and it is where vulnerability finds healing and bliss, completeness, both with yourself and your partner. Until now my sexual relationships have focused too much on orgasm - once you and your partner come mission is accomplished... There's more about intimacy, and sex of course, and this movie is a good introduction to other philosophies that aim for more spiritual and meaningful relationships, personal growth, and intimacy.<br />I loved it and I am glad I own it. I am sure I will watch it again, as a good reference to have and reminder of what I want my intimate relationship to be.

 | product/productId: 0736079971 | review/userId: A2A1N0YF3Z8AMI | review/summary: Exactly what it advertises | review/text: This is a great DVD that covers essential Need to Know positioning and movement from the bottom.  This includes great drills.  My son (11) went through the tape with me.  By the third time we had the moves and drills on a note card and were practicing from there.  My son was always getting turned and giving up back points in matches when he was on bottom, after three sessions he is already 50% better on the bottom and is improving every time we drill these fundamentals.  He is NEVER on his belly anymore.  Too often the fundamentals are given way to "moves" in wrestling practice.  Very few kids know how to use their hips and really understand wrestling.  This is the missing link in a lot of wrestling programs that I see out there.  I wish I had this tape when I was wrestling 20 years ago.<br /><br />One word of caution on the seller.  I had the bottom position overnighted for 5 more dollars and it came as promised.  I went ahead and ordered top and standing position videos and it is taking about 10+ days for them to arrive because they are taking their time shipping them.  This is a little ridiculous. Plan accordingly.
 | product/productId: 6302457041 | review/userId: A3U56M0Y8LYO6J | review/summary: "Klingons appreciate strong women." | review/text: "Angel One" undoubtedly was intended to be an insightful commentary on the nature of gender dynamics and sexual politics when it was originally conceived.  Unfortunately, it comes across as something that not even the most generous viewer would describe as "enlightening."  Essentially it wound up in its final form as something closer to the television equivalent of bird cage liner.<br /><br />The Enterprise-D arrives at planet Angel One to search for survivors from a lost Federation freighter.  They discover that the male survivors are considered fugitives due to their refusal to embrace the planet's matriarchal ruling structure.  Yet, the men refuse to return to the Federation when discovered because they have found spouses on the planet.  After the fugitives are captured, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) attempts to transport them to the Enterprise-D but abandons his plan when the danger of shipwide contamination by a virus from the planet arises.<br /><br />Watching Riker save the day in "Angel One" by relying on his "manliness" will either strike you as offensive or will cause you to guffaw uncontrollably.  Either reaction is undesirable and speaks to the multitude of problems inherent in this episode from start to finish.  Even if you disregard the sloppily-constructed male-female-battle-of-the-sexes angle of the story, the manner in which the threatening virus and the danger in the Neutral Zone come out of left field makes you wonder if any care or serious creative thought actually went into the writing of "Angel One."  Ring up this outing as one of the low points of the first season and an episode to avoid whenever it appears as a re-run on television.

 | product/productId: 6300182150 | review/userId: A1I8F97AHES8YD | review/summary: The Negroes took our dates! | review/text: All college movies begin and end with a little film called National Lampoon's Animal House. A foray into movies for the first time for National Lampoon, having succeeded on radio and as a magazine, this raucous classic has everything you'd want in a comedy: memorable characters & quotes, partying, a great soundtrack, and a group of unknowns that became stars overnight.<br /><br /> The basic plot: freshmen Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) and Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) are rejected from the preppy Omega fraternity and head to the Delta house, where Kent's older brother Fred went. Delta turns out to be the party frat, aka 'animal house,' at Faber College, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) wants them shut down and puts them on double secret probation. But Delta won't die, so one toga party, road trip, horse killing, food fight, and parade destruction later, the Deltas beat the rules.<br /><br /> Saying Animal House always brings to mind John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the 7-year Delta member whose grade point average is 0.0 and who gives fine advice like, "Start drinking heavily." Bluto is the best character hands down, and his speech to get the Deltas back up when they're down is classic, yelling, "Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"<br /><br /> So if you haven't see Animal House, you basically haven't lived. See it now, then watch it again. GATOR!
 | product/productId: 0740318934 | review/userId: A11FQBRD7LAAR1 | review/summary: History by religionists instead of historians | review/text: There should be warning labels on histories like this one that are not written by actual historians. This production is the product of embarrassingly bad research which doesn't even deserve to be called research, because it determines its conclusions before the research is done. This man will actually make up quotes from founding fathers that have no basis in fact. He actually claims that James Madison wanted the U.S. to be a Christian nation, among many other laughably inaccurate statements. It is a shame David Barton can find so many gullible customers who have not learned the most important educational lesson, the skill of critical thinking.
 | product/productId: 6301977785 | review/userId: A1VQ4V2I0VIJA4 | review/summary: Watch it for Yul Brynner's performance | review/text: Good points: Yul Brynner does an excellent job as the menacing, devil-eyed gunslinger. He's so much better than the other actors, you want him onscreen as much as possible, even though he's a villain. The film has an interesting concept, even today. It's watchable all the way through, if you turn your mind down to low gear.<p>Bad points: Calling a film "watchable" is far from saying it's good. This one is not. Richard Benjamin is just not a very good actor, never has been, especially in lead roles. James Brolin doesn't have much to do, but he's weak anyway. Most everyone else is playing robots, and they act like it. The scientists in the film are cardboard cliches of "geeks with white lab coats". Dick Van Patten has a small part as in several 'comedy relief' scenes, which are so bad they're almost unwatchable. The film is amateurishly made and directed (though not ridiculously so), and gets worse as it goes along. There are large lapses in logic and believability. It has very little rewatchability - you see it once and move on quickly.<p>But none of that matters too much, because this type of film is not meant to be "Citizen Kane". In fact, it's somewhat similar to "Terminator", another mindless movie, though much better made. "Westworld" is a mildly pleasurable way to spend 90 minutes, but you might feel like you've had too much cotton candy when it's over. The DVD has no special features except the trailer, but the widescreen transfer and soundtrack are fine. This is better rented than owned. You won't be returning to it very much unless you're really desperate.
 | product/productId: 0800137841 | review/userId: A12VP0GD5V8UKB | review/summary: Good but something is missing! | review/text: That meaning something is missing from both the film and the DVD. I agree with various reviewers that this should be more entitled "Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein", because that is essentially what it is. It's more a rehash of the British Horrors of the 60s, and hardly a faithful rendition of the novel. Even Bride of Frankenstein was more faithful than this.<br />The story begins very well with the voyage of the Sea Captain encountering the emaciated Dr. F, a footnote not many are familiar with. The story begins from Victor's childhood, and the tragedy of his Mother's death turns his quest into an obsession. The build-up towards the Creature's birthing sequence is very well staged. I do like DeNiro's develop of the Creature. First as a mentally underdeveloped brute, then slowly becoming educated through sight, touch, sense, smell, and taste. Heck, anybody who maintains a fairly decent complexion through a balanced diet of raw potatoes should catch on quickly. After the inevitable scene where the Creature is banished from humankind and seeks revenge is where the entire story begins to spin madly out of control.<p>Too many key scenes in the film that DO take place in the novel all occur out of sequence. The Monster's encounter with Victor in the snow mountains, the murder of William, and the hanging of Justine. In the novel, Justine is condemned to the gallows, and Victor seeking solitude has a not so fortuitous encounter with his creation. There the Creature tells his story beginning with his birth. It's the same thing for Elizabeth's death scene. He was supposed to strangle her - not play Mortal Kombat by plucking her heart out. Following that where Victor revives an amalgamated Elizabeth/Justine is too campy. It spoofs not only BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, but all the others; Andy Warhol's 1974 FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, even FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND. I do like that Helena Bonham Carter, like Catherine Rabett before her makes a sexy Elizabeth. John Cleese, Tom Hulce, Aidan Quinn, and Ian Holm are also always joys to see onscreen.<p>I'll say Kenneth Branagh and Robert DeNiro had a good time making this movie. I like the scene where he tries about thirteen times to help him stand over a layer of amniotic fluid. Patrick Doyle's score and Roger Pratt's camerawork also don't help the production much, making the film even more overwhelming. So do I recommend it? I'm ashamed to say it, but yes. The trouble is I still have YET to see a movie version of the novel that is entirely faithful. The film has it's strengths and weaknesses, and is still an enjoyable treat for those in the mood for an entirely different perception of FRANKENSTEIN than the Gothic trademark laboratory and lightning.<p>As far as the DVD is concerned, the picture and sound quality is outstanding. The color contrasts are treated so they are appropriately light during day, and bluish-dark during night. This is not an uncommon restoration process through silent classics. Seeing the film in widescreen also gives it a very different dimension. The VHS version looks too lacking in color and contrast. Watch it with the lights turned off, and you'll see what I mean. The extras include French and Spanish audio, and the original trailer, plus strangely enough the MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING trailer. My only disappointment with it is there is no audio commentary from Branagh and/or DeNiro. If a newer version of the DVD is released including an audio commentary I would be very interested in hearing it.<p>To wrap it all up, this is a good version of the FRANKENSTEIN saga, but along the way, I can never help but feel something just is not appropriately registered.

 | product/productId: 0790729989 | review/userId: A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ | review/summary: A Dark, Well-Made Masterwork Of The Macabre. | review/text: David Fincher's &quot;Seven,&quot; according to one of the experts on one of the commentaries in this DVD edition, has become some sort of modern classic. It doesn't surprise me. &quot;Seven&quot; takes typical cop-film ideas and morphs them into a dark, creepy, memorable tale of serial murder. The violence of the film is psychological, because what's really disturbing is the things the film makes you think about, not on screen gore. Look closely and you'll see that there is not that much violence in the movie, it's the brilliant way in which Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) set up mood and atmosphere. The cinematography is dark, beautiful and shadowy, giving the impression that there are evil things lurking in the shadows or just down the hall. The characters can be believed, and we really do care about them when the final shock comes. The performances are also superb, not least Kevin Spacey's serial killer, John Doe, who seems like a cousin of Hannibal Lecter. &quot;Seven&quot; also has a mind, the details of the plot are complex because they are not just materialistic things, you really have to think, to examine the ideas and thoughts in the story. This is the film, which I think, remains David Fincher's masterpiece. His latest, &quot;Fight Club,&quot; was less intelligent or memorable. It was good, but doesn't go in league with this masterwork of the macabre. &quot;Seven&quot; raises chilling little feelings in you, disturbing thoughts and ideas, which is what great horror is supposed to do, yet it never loses intelligence. This special DVD edition will offer more material to better understand the film's structure, there's even a look at the making of John Doe's notebooks. &quot;Seven&quot; is a must for those who love a smart, creepy tale.

Some would settle in small mining encampments where each had their claims to search for the precious ore, but greed could encourage some to try and drive people away from their claims.  Such was the setting for the 1985 film "Pale Rider", which was directed by Clint Eastwood.  Located a few miles from a small town, a mining encampment includes the hard-working Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty), a woman that he's been living with named Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) and her teenaged daughter Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny).  Frustrated with rising bills at the nearby country store and a greedy & wealthy man named Coy LaHood (Richard A. Dysart) who is trying to drive away the miners, Hull and Sarah's relationship is somewhat strained.  After Megan prays for assistance and is reading a verse in the Book of Revelation that states "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death" (Rev. 6:8), she sees a man riding a pale horse approaching.  The rider comes to be known only as "The Preacher" (Clint Eastwood) and after helping Hull out of a skirmish with some of LaHood's men, Hull invites the Preacher to stay with him, Sarah and Megan. It isn't before long that the Preacher begins to give the miners at Hull's encampment courage to stand up to LaHood and to work together.  LaHood, of course, is furious that a preacher is helping them because he wants their land so that he can use his very destructive hydraulic mining technology to strip the land of whatever gold may be there.  When LaHood can't buy the Preacher out of the encampment, he resorts to hiring a "marshal" of sorts named Stockburn (John Russell, 1921-1991) and his "deputies" to get rid of the Preacher.  LaHood, however, doesn't know what the Preacher is capable of doing.<br /><br />With excellent cinematography, interesting characters, an engaging story and good acting, "Pale Rider" is an excellent film.  Other memorable characters include LaHood's son Josh (Chris Penn), Club (Richard Kiel, who is better known for his portrayal of the character "Jaws" from the James Bond films "The Spy Who Loved Me" & "Moonraker" in 1977 & 1979 respectively), McGill (Charles Hallahan), Ma Blankenship (Fran Ryan, 1916-2000) and Jed Blankenship (Richard Hamilton, 1920-2004).  Memorable scenes include the Preacher's arrival, the boulder, visiting LaHood's hydraulic mine, the arrival of Stockburn and the final scenes.  Overall, I rate "Pale Rider" with 5 stars.

 | product/productId: 6301324382 | review/userId: A3T46X7M3AUDAB | review/summary: A flawed but fascinating diamond in the rough | review/text: You've seen this story many times before: strange & eccentric new kid enters school, he's possibly crazy & possibly gifted, befriended by that one understanding teacher, has a powerful & positive effect on his classmates.<br /><br />But this one is a little different, a little more daring.<br /><br />Most stories about gifted, rebellious outsiders make it clear from the very start that the hero deserves admiration & emulation. The good guys & bad guys are drawn in bold black & white lines, so that the viewer feels very comfortable identifying with the hero. This allows the viewer a vicarious & all-too-easy inner glow of satisfaction, even superiority, without any real risk.<br /><br />Again, this one is a little different.<br /><br />Rex Voorhaas is clearly eccentric, clearly gifted -- and clearly troubled as well. His Otherness has set him apart from the everyday, run-of-the-mill world, and that's enough to draw others toward him. In that respect, he's the classic rebellious hero & inspiration.<br /><br />But this story never makes it too comfortable for the viewer. Rex can be embarrassing, make the viewer squirm uncomfortably at times & wish that he'd just rein it in a bit, keep it acceptable & non-threatening for everyone. But he never does. He keeps the viewer guessing, on edge, not quite sure if he's truly gifted or just cracking up. Or is he both?<br /><br />That's what gives this small film such power, despite its rough corners & lack of cinematic polish. (And maybe those aren't necessarily flaws, either.) It doesn't make things easy for the viewer. It doesn't promise popularity & success for going against the norm -- if anything, it emphasizes that such actions may come at a higher price than most are willing to pay.<br /><br />Yet it's not warning us against nonconformity, either. There's no question that it approves of breaking through the numbed, narrow, mass-produced worldview that controls the lives of the majority. It just reminds us that such a breakthrough COSTS.<br /><br />The genuine individual is seldom applauded & celebrated while alive, although that often happens once the individual is safely dead, and thus easy to homogenize for the masses. More often, the genuine individual is marginalized, or crushed outright. But there's always room for those who become "individuals" according to the majority-approved rules of "individuality" ... just like all the hundreds of thousands exactly like them. The ones we see celebrated in the mass media. The safe ones.<br /><br />The ones who are nothing like the troubled, disturbing, compelling Rex Voorhaas.<br /><br />This unusual film isn't available on DVD, and the odds are that it never will be. But if you can find a copy, it's worth picking up. Rather than just reinforcing your cocoon of comfort, it'll make you uncomfortable & make you think. And that's a rare, valuable thing these days -- highly recommended!
 | product/productId: 0783235704 | review/userId: AIZY7MALOPIHC | review/summary: Totally underrated nailbiter | review/text: I am mystfied how all these film &quot;experts&quot; can say that this film is disappointing? Having seen countless Hitchcock films, I have to say that &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; is perhaps the most suspenseful film if his I've ever seen (save maybe &quot;Rear Window&quot;). The last 45 minutes of this film had me in and out of my chair, talking to the screen and totally engrossed. There is an almost inhumane amount of suspense then relief, then more suspense then more relief. It was eerie, in fact, how much of a puppet I became in watching this film some 35 years after it was made; Hitchcock is sitting above somewhere, probably very pleased. All in all, this is an engaging film that will take you on a rollercoaster ride as it did me.

 | product/productId: 0780021266 | review/userId: A1L8HRCM60W0W7 | review/summary: EERIE BUT INTRIGUING. | review/text: First, this enigmatic film is NOT based on a true story. A group of school girls go on a school excursion to &quot;Hanging Rock&quot; in Victoria, Australia. The period is around early 1900s. Four girls decide to climb the rock along with a teacher. At the end of the day, only one hysterical girl can be found, and can shed no light on what happened to the others.<p>Sound intriguing enough? This film asks more questions that it answers, inviting the viewer to dream up their own explanation for what happened to the girls. According to the Joan Lindsay novel's &quot;missing chapter&quot;, the girls were sucked down a wormhole (or something), but I think both Lindsay and Weir were wise to leave this out. Which perhaps adds to the mystique. <p>In all its nebulous beauty, the film actually does a remarkable job of capturing a resplendent mood. The Australian vistas are even more evocative than that of &quot;The Piano&quot; -- ethereal and brooding. This curious rock that hangs over the film with its menacing presence is given almost mythical status, and even to the viewer on the other side of the screen seems oddly alluring. <p>Personally I'd have liked the ending to be a bit different, but hey, the movie is hauntingly memorable, and if it's any consolation, it's not until after the movie you may wish for a more clear-cut resolution.

 | product/productId: 6302157552 | review/userId: A3TRXPRUYVOLSM | review/summary: I wasn't offended -- but I was bored. | review/text: "In the Realm of the Senses" is a beautifully shot, well-acted film that is incredibly controversial -- and, in my view, incredibly dull. I found it to be a lovely-looking exercise in tedium.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, concerns a man and a woman in obsessive lust with each other. They have sex many times. Many times. Many, many times. These scenes are not particularly erotic or titillating; their lovemaking seems compulsive and peculiarly joyless. Anyway, even if a viewer starts out thinking of this film as sexually exciting, the ultra-violent ending (which I won't spoil here) will certainly kill that feeling.<br /><br />In the liner notes of the rather excellent Blu-ray, Japanese film historian Donald Ritchie very persuasively argues that the film is too artistic to be dismissed as porn. However, he further argues that it is an effective critique of the repressive aspects of Japanese society, and on this point Donald and I must part company. In my view, the film contains far too little historical context or explicitly political content to count as a significant critique of 1930s Japanese militarism (or, for that matter, mid-1970s Japanese society). Sure, the film contains one interesting image of the male protagonist walking in the opposite direction from a column of soldiers -- but one shot does not constitute an entire political argument.<br /><br />Perhaps the film is more meaningful for Japanese viewers, who can pick up on subtle historical allusions and understand better the restrictive moral standards that the director is attacking. However, as an American viewer, I pretty much missed all of the social commentary. Besides, the main characters are so narcissistic -- and so cruel to other people -- that I fail to see what makes them appealing as "rebels." If I had to choose between living like these creepy, obsessive lovers, or living in human society with all its dull restrictions, I think I'd gladly pick society! There is such a thing as rebelling in the wrong way, you know?<br /><br />Anyway, political mumbo-jumbo aside, my main problems with this movie are that it's very thin on incident and very thin on characterization (we know almost nothing of the protagonists, except that they really, really like each other). I was expecting an art movie with a bit of sex in it, and I ended up with a sex movie with a bit of art in it. Disappointing.

Mission accomplished!  If your looking for a deep meaningful movie forget it.  If  your offended by nudity forget it.

From  the opening to the close of the movie your senses are bombarded with the  goings on of a very sexy and very often nude Natasha Henstridge's fight for  her alien life.  The story line is solid and cohesive, with a few twists  and turns thrown in this classic SciFi tale.  Species is filled with: great  actions sequences, excellent sound, very high quality production, and good  acting from a superb cast.  A classic mix of SciFi and Action required  viewing for any true SciFi buff and an excellent choice.

Her manner toward Rochester rings false, because she is too mature.  Timothy Dalton, in addition to being too pretty, sounds and looks stilted.  Yes, the dialogue is quite true to the book, but the lines sound completely unnatural. At times, I thought of skits from Saturday Night Live.

 | product/productId: 0788821075 | review/userId: AH4SL0YL5AQVU | review/summary: Excellent Movie, but Not Much Different in Blu-ray | review/text: My companion has adored this movie since its theatrical release, and she owned at various times a couple of previous editions.  She never seems to tire of it, and knows every scene and cites the pivotal dialogue as it's coming up.  That's love, folks, so I bought this Blu-ray edition for her birthday.  Knowing the movie as she does, a klaxon went off when brief scenes were omitted.  I was at first disappointed -- and a little angry -- when she told me that it was cut short by about five minutes from the 15th Anniversary edition.  However, thanks to Mr. Amith's very informative review below (if I could have voted "yes" for him multiple times, I would have), that's all cleared up, that this Blu-ray edition is the THEATRICAL release.  It hasn't been cut so much as RESTORED to its original length.  Why the studio simply didn't include both versions on the disc, as has been done with other titles, is an obvious question, but not one that needs to be answered to enjoy this.<br /><br />For the picture quality itself, the Blu-ray improvement is only slight, as it's not the type of movie that has a real advantage in hi-def.  It's a charming story with a sleek visual style, so it merely looks sleeker, but not necessarily more revealing.  Still, if you love this movie, you should treat yourself to the best transfer available, and, of course, this is it.  As noted, all of the bonus features from the 15th Anniversary Edition have been brought over.  If the DC is your favorite version, you'll have to wait a while.  Because this is a much beloved movie, more than likely, there will be a 20th Anniversary edition -- next year -- with probably both cuts on it.<br />_________________________________

Pure delight.  Pure Spielberg!<br /><br />Thanks a million, Steven, for going back to the 1982 version...the print that shows the the guns (yes, government agents carry guns, and, pray tell, perish the thought, sometimes have to use them; they would certainly be brandishing firearms during something so monumentally earth-shattering as a visit from an extra-terrestrial!), that shows E.T. in all his superbly-operated anamatronic rubber puppet glory, for allowing us to hear Mom telling Michael "You are not going (for Halloween) as a TERRORIST!" comment, and Michael saying, uncensored, in his shoulder pads, at the fridge, "...nothin' but hell-shIt!"

 | product/productId: 1591791847 | review/userId: A1KGFR32FA7ZLR | review/summary: a great purchase | review/text: I chose this DVD based on the large number of reviews, most of which were positive.  The level of instruction on this DVD is great for people at a late beginner or intermediate stage in their yoga practice, but you can also turn off the instruction and just flow if you are more advanced.  Shiva also describes/demos alternative poses that are better for beginners or for different body types and strength levels.  I consider myself to be intermediate and have been learning a lot just by watching Shiva in the DVD and her yoga mastery/artistry.  I love that you are getting many workouts in one purchase and the yoga matrix is fabulous.  Building your own workout with just what you want can turn this product into anyone's perfect, custom yoga DVD.  One thing that I would change for myself is that many sequences contain postures that I cannot now nor will ever be able to achieve (based on my body proportions and injury sensitivities) - mostly arm balancing poses.  I find that I need to fast-forward through these segments, which does interrupt my flow.  I could choose to skip segments that have these poses, but in almost every case there are plenty of other poses in the segment that I do want to do, so I just deal with the fast-forwarding.  I also know that if you cannot get into a posture you can just stay at the preparation stage, but I usually find that the preparation stage does not do anything for me.  Clearly someone who can already do these poses or who is genuinely working toward them will not have this same complaint.  Because you can choose your own workout with the matrix feature, there is a slight learning curve in maximizing this DVD to your preferences - as soon as you learn what postures are in each segment you can build your perfect workout.  For instance, it is possible to select segments that end up giving you a workout full of twists (I actually love this!), or with too many back bends (my body has a limit!).  This isn't a flaw in the DVD, just something to beware of as you build your workout.  Because of the matrix and because there are 4 'built-in' workouts, I still feel like this DVD is new every time I use it.

Before the first act closes he kills three men and rapes a woman - all done with a disturbingly casual intensity. Not exactly the kind of guy you want to find yourself rooting for.<br />The film unfolds wonderfully, moving effortlessly between dark drama and self-conscious satire of western film conventions. The action is periodically interspersed with some very creepy fever dreams...

The Rick character again appears, though with a new name... The film is a fairly routinely adventure, with a plot that isn't all that interesting, and with a frequently laughable dialog, but it sparks into life when Bogart and the leading blonde, with whom he is deeply in love and to whom he will later be married, appear...<br /><br />The girl is Lauren Bacall, in her first movie... Cool, smooth, and gorgeous, she sets the screen on fire from her first entrance... She was a new kind of heroine...<br /><br />Opposite Bogart she was colorful and believable... She had no illusions about herself... She was used to getting by, making out as best she could... She wanted Bogey and she let him know it... She offers herself to him, bravely and without shame: ' You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. (She opens his door and pauses.) You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together - and blow.'<br /><br />With the effective use of her sexy, sultry, speaking voice and her confident eyes, Howard Hawks creates a new screen image, and one of the most sizzling yet sexual propositions on film...<br /><br />Lauren Bacall has become heir to our memories of the truly memorable star of the 1940s, and, in her own way, one of them...<br /><br />"To Have or Have Not" was remade as "The Breaking Point" with John Garfield and "The Gun Runners" with Audie Murphy and both were, inferior to the original...

I see a lot of reviews here which slam the third movie, but that was "Anne of Green Gables-- The Continuing Story".  I won't argue with this slammage, but the Amazon DVD offering at issue here seems, by the title and the photo, to be "Anne of Avonlea/Anne of Green Gables-- The Sequel".  So on to my review:<p>I think this movie is a gem; quiet intensity and charm.  You can read a million reviews of that aspect here: I'm concentrating on the disc quality, since no one else seems to.  <p>First of all: this disc is a "flipper" (you have to flip the DVD over in the middle of the movie), but people accustomed to changing tapes in the middle of the show on the old VHS version aren't going to whine that much when they have to do the DVD equivalent.  I know I didn't.<p>That said, the picture quality is the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the *worst*.  Worse even than when Sullivan put the original miniseries out on DVD.  The transfer is exceptionally grainy, and the opening credit montage, with seaside vistas of shoreline and ocean, has horrible compression-artifact induced pixellation: there are hideous globs of blocky-looking areas in the ocean, in the rock, even on Megan Follows' face.  It is sad that a beautiful picture like this has been marred by such an unprofessional transfer.<p>My advice is not to buy this disc.  Sullivan Entertainment fooled me once when they sold me the first version of Anne of Green Gables "Digitally Restored" on DVD and it looked awful. Shame on them. They fooled me twice when they put out a "Collectors Edition", and I assumed that they were so embarrassed by the look of the original that surely they *must* have remastered it. Shame on me. They fooled me a third time with Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel, which is supposedly "Digitally Restored", too, but honestly looks more like an MPEG-1 VCD than a DVD.  And all three releases are for the ridiculous price ...to us Stateside fools. <p>I was a trusting fool. Don't be fooled like I was. Keep your VHS tapes, no matter how worn. Avoid this release like the bubonic plague, and hope that a video distributor like Buena Vista with *some* standards for quality gets the rights to this film, and is able to do it right. I am very disappointed, and Sullivan Entertainment will *never* again get any more of my cash.

Maybe Christopher Plummer tries a little too hard to out-Montalban Ricardo Montalban, but he almost  pulls it off.<p>The only down side to this DVD edition is that it does not  include the several added scenes included on the laserdisc version.  That's  the only version I've seen the last several times and it seems strange to  have those scenes missing.<p>It's still good to have this version available  on DVD.

It starts out as your basic slasher film; good looking young people on an isolated island get killed one by one.  Then you get to the ending, which breaks out of the formula.  A delightful movie.  I just wish the DVD edition had some extras.

Every young person should see it, as it realistically presents the struggles that Ben Carson had to overcome. As a young black man from a single parent family, he has become the top brain surgeon in the world, and he is so humble about it that one cannot help but be thrilled that he is there, as well as be encouraged that if you or a loved one needed his gifted hands, he would not hesitate to help you, regardless of who you are or where you are from. Of great interest are the clips at the end where the actual Ben is interviewed. He mentions that the college graduation rate for young black men is 15%, and that this can be changed by discipline and hard work, as he did. Yet the film also portrays his Christian faith, unashamedly, but it is not offensive in any way; simply part of his life. He is truly gifted and an amazing person. Get ready to cry.

However, the major standout of this movie is the slam-bang theme from Carly Simon.  It has to be the best of all the opening melodies/performances ever to accompany the magnificent images, including Shirley Bassey's monumental &quot;Theme from Goldfinger.&quot;  Although Barry's music is missed, Marvin Hamlisch did a serviceable job, especially with the music during the ski and helicopter chases, respectively.

No straggling now. There you go.<br /><br />I must have only seen "Mary Poppins" when I was a little kid because I only barely remembered the movie when I was watching it and definitely didn't remember the plot. Definitely an experience worth having, whether you've seen it once, or many, many times.<br /><br />The basic plot is that two kids have been a real terror to their nannies, but not so much out of meanness as the nannies' domineering personalities. They draw up a list of their needs for a nanny and when the wind changes, Mary Poppins comes, despite their tight-laced fathers' wishes. They're soon off on fantastical adventures that may just change the lifestyle of their entire family! This movie makes important comments about suffrage, structure, and just finding the joy in life. It's supercalifragilisticexpealidocious! (And I didn't even have to look that up!)<br /><br />The movie is presented in wide-screen with fully-restored, bright and colorful animation and practically perfect sound. There's also both a subtitle and a close-caption track, although oddly these differ greatly in what they do and don't pick up on. I ended up keeping on both.<br /><br />Like other recent Disney Platinum releases, this DVD contains a wealth of special features that will help you to enjoy the movie more. Chief among them is a great deleted song. You also get a complete making-of feature, a look at the movie magic, a game, promo posters and trailers and many other simply delightful goodies.<br /><br />Like the "Aladdin" release, this release is loaded with both a commentary track and pop-up fun-facts. If you actually decide to watch all of this stuff, you'll end up having seen the film at least three times by the time you're done!<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Go off now and buy this! Spit-spot!

 | product/productId: 0783211856 | review/userId: ALR35EFI69S5R | review/summary: Stark &amp; Troubling Look At The Realities Of The Holocaust! | review/text: This is an extremely troubling, scrupulously accurate, and endlessly  compelling screen adaptation of Thomas Keneally's non-fiction best seller  depicting the events surrounding Oscar Schindler's acts in saving hundreds  of Polish Jews from certain death in the concentration camps by employing  them in manufacturing "essential materials" in war-time Poland. Steven  Spielberg negotiates his way carefully through the potential minefield of  controversy in his stunningly graphic and emotional portrayal of the plight  of Polish Jews as the Germans began their preparations for what became the  "Final Solution" to the "Jewish Question" in the occupied sectors of Poland  in the early 1940s. <p>As a serious student of 20th century history, I am  indeed impressed by the care with which Spielberg has faithfully recreated  the details of the occupation, from Schindler's initial entrepreneurial  preoccupation with exploiting Jewish investors and workers for his own  profit to the moral indifference and cruelty of Christian Poles toward  their Jewish countrymen. The scenes early in the movie depicting the Jews  being forcibly ejected from their homes and the trail of local residents  taunting and abusing them is among the powerful on film, as are the later  episodes showing the barbarism of the Nazis both within the Jewish ghetto  and in the streets, casually murdering Jews as simply as squashing a  noisome mosquito. The story line provides the viewer with a profound  opportunity to be an eyewitness to one of the most shameful and sorry  periods in modern world history, as we witness just how base and cruel  ordinary human beings can be.<p>The cast, of course, is absolutely  terrific, from Liam Neeson to Ben Kingsley to Ralph Fiennes. In particular,  Fiennes' brilliant portrayal of a Nazi officer capable of such casual  violence as to nonchalantly order a Jewish engineer shot because she  corrects an error made by incompetent German military engineers gives a  glimpse into the maddening darkness and banality of evil. Once again,  modern American film shows us why serious cinematic efforts like this must  be actively sponsored and appreciated. If a photo is worth a thousand  words, this breathtaking film is worth a library. It accurately illustrates  in its short three or four hours duration more about the individual reality  of what world war meant to each of the millions of noncombatants who  perished at the hands of evil incarnate than any book may do. This is a  movie I plan to use to teach European history to lethargic high-schoolers  to wake them out of their self-absorption into an active interest in the  world. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand what  the Holocaust meant, and how it happened.

Though &quot;sick&quot; might seem like the wrong way to describe this movie, I chose to use that word. The  only thing that's sick in the movie is Patrick Bateman.<p>I'm sure you've  read enough about this movie to know who and what Bateman is, so I won't  get in to specifics.<p>The movie is both a Horror-flick and a Comedy, all  meshed into one. You might not think that that's an easy thing to pull off,  but this movie does it just perfectly on all levels possible.<p>You're  never quite sure if Bateman really kills anyone. It might all be in his  head. There's no question about the fact that he's totally mental, but you  never really know about the murders. The murder-scenes aren't all that  gory. Sure, there's blood, but not extreme ammounts of it. As I also  mentioned, it's also a comedy. I laughed my ass of in some scenes, and so  will you, probably. You laugh at the fact that Bateman is so incredibly  sick and that he has such little connection to the &quot;real  world&quot;.<p>Well, anyways, this is a very entertaining flick, and I  really recommend the Unrated version of it. HEY, PAUL!
 | product/productId: 0792833236 | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: A triumph of American cinema; a landmark if ever there was one... | review/text: Considered by many to be the greatest film of the 80's, and ranking number four on AFI's top 100 greatest American films, `Raging Bull' has become a landmark in American cinema.  Martin Scorsese will always be remembered for this film, and rightfully so, for `Raging Bull' is not merely a sports film or merely just a drama but `Raging Bull' captures something rare, something monumental.  `Raging Bull' captures the essence of a man and the time in which he lived with such precise perfection that the audience is transported into this mans life, walking in his shoes and fighting his personal (as well as professional) battles.<br /><br />There are many facets to this movie that help elevate it to `masterpiece' levels of brilliance.  First you have the flawless direction by Martin Scorsese.  In my humble opinion this is probably his finest moment behind the lens.  Scorsese is often praised for his `gangster' films, most notably `Good Fellas', but in my eyes it will always be his weightier work that shines the brightest.  Films like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull' are truly Scorsese's crowning achievements.  His decision to shoot the film in classic black and white film is another bonus to an already fantastic film.  It adds layers of honesty and humanity that are at times lost in the glitzy colors flooding the screen.  Stripping it down in this way allows the rawness and realness of these people to shine through ten fold.  Scorsese is also responsible for capturing some of the greatest scenes of violence ever recorded on film.  Of course this is violence within the ring, calculated and controlled violence, but Scorsese displays it in such a sporadic and brutal way that the audience is in a way pummeled mercilessly by the images attacking the screen.  The only other director I've seen able to capture this same intensity was Ron Howard in `Cinderella Man'.  Others have tried, and they have done so admirably, but truly none have reached this level of perfection.  Scorsese was also able to capture the feel and mood of the era in which `Raging Bull' takes place.  The way individuals interact with one another, the dialog and the emotional construction is a marvelous representation of the time period as well as the subject.  Scorsese had a real grasp of what he was attempting to deliver, and the end result is nothing short of perfection.  Couple this with Michael Chapman's glorious cinematography, rich and vibrant despite it's grit and lack of color, and you have a film that looks as brilliant as it plays out.<br /><br />Honestly though, no matter how brilliant Scorsese was, `Raging Bull' would be nothing without Robert De Niro.  As the tortured and violent boxer Jake La Motta, De Niro ignites the screen with fiery determination and complete control and understanding of his character.  This is one of those moments where the actor is so lost within his character that you forget you are watching a motion picture.  These are the moments that cement De Niro as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen.  Sure, his recent film choices have been less than desirable, but there is no denying that in his prime he was better than anyone has ever been.<br /><br />De Niro has help in the form of Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci.  Pesci is flawless as Jake's devoted brother Joey.  From his very first scene onward you are drawn into his character and become invested in him.  Pesci is always on top of his game when playing the scheming and loud mouthed gangster (i.e. `Casino' and his Oscar winning performance in `Good Fellas') but here he is more subdued and subtle and I think this adds a layer of realism to his performance.  In my opinion, this may be his finest performance to date.  Cathy Moriarty is also stunning as Vickie, La Motta's second wife.  The blonde bombshell gives De Niro a run for his money and proves she is more than just a pretty face.  Her attachment to her character is obvious and certainly pays off in the end.<br /><br />`Raging Bull' masterfully interweaves La Motta's violent profession with his violent persona, giving us a glimpse into a man who took his work home with him in the most literal of senses.  There is no flaw to be found here, for Scorsese crafts a marvelous portrait of a man destroyed by his own carnal weaknesses.  Looking back, I don't think it can be stressed enough how marvelous the year of 1980 really was.  All five Best Picture nominees were deserving of their nominations, and while `Raging Bull' is not my favorite of the five (in my humblest of opinions `The Elephant Man' was the Best Picture of 1980) there is no doubt in my mind that Martin Scorsese deserved that directing Oscar one-thousand times over.  Regardless, there is no denying the fact that `Raging Bull' is a flawless film, a marvel, a spectacle and most definitely one of the greatest films ever made.
 | product/productId: 1573623709 | review/userId: A1BNO3T1U8BGEG | review/summary: Three things you should know about Closure | review/text: I hate myself for not buying this set earlier. Buy it this instant or risk a life of regret!<p>However, there are three things I think you should know.<p>A. You should know that this is a bit more than a simple videography. Specifically, I expected the second tape to give me every NIN video (up to &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;), and it did that. But it's much more unified than the usual one-video-after-another videography format. It doesn't have that &quot;greatest hits&quot; feel. The classic videos are gathered together with strange turn of the century (?) film reels (&quot;Electrocuting the Elephant&quot; is a memorable one), and several untitled arty &quot;videos&quot; for those quiet little &quot;ninstrumentals&quot; which appear between the better known songs-with-lyrics on &quot;Broken&quot; &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; and &quot;Further Down the Spiral.&quot; Both tapes are suitable for playing repeatedly during a loud-and-freaky party or for gathering your art school (not to mention psychology school) friends for viewing-and-analysis party.<p>B. You should know that these tapes are bizarrely packaged. Much as I love NIN, their packaging is getting stranger and stranger. In a way it's cool and in a way it's just tiresome. The &quot;Broken&quot; case is one thing, but by the time &quot;The Fragile&quot; rolled around... enough already. If you have a fetish for keeping your music stuff in near-new condition (I do), know that you will probably damage this video set the moment you receive it. The whole setup (an irritating Downward Spiral-esque plastic sleeve over a box around two boxes with the videos inside) made me feel like a spastic infant. Not to mention that the Part 2 tape has no content label; the videos and their credits don't appear anywhere except at the end of the tape. I'm sure they intend for you to view the whole tape as a unit (and you should), but I like to have a table of contents, you know? I'd rather have an elaborate brochure than a box that can only become tragically frayed. This is the only real complaint I have about this set, and it is not nearly enough to make me take off a star. But for anyone else with similar personal glitch,  here's the video list from the end of Part 2:<p> &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;  Director: Eric Zimmerman  ;  &quot;Sin&quot;  Director: Brett Turnbull  ;  &quot;Down in It&quot;  Director: Eric Zimmerman/Benjamin Stokes  ;  &quot;Pinion&quot;  Director: Eric Goode/Serge Becker  ;  &quot;Wish&quot;  Director: Peter Christopherson  ;  &quot;Help Me I am in Hell&quot;  Director: Eric Goode/Serge Becker  ;  &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;  Director: Jon Reiss  ;  &quot;March of the Pigs&quot;  Director: Peter Christopherson  ;  &quot;Eraser/Hurt/Wish&quot; - Live  Director: Simon Maxwell  ;  &quot;Closer&quot;  Director: Mark Romanek  ;  &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;  Director: Mark Romanek<p>C. You should know that this set is explicit. If you're a NIN fan, this probably won't bug you. If you can handle any one of these: movie gore, German sex art, or the surgery channel-- you'll be fine. There's an abstract quality to most of the creepier themes, but this is not for those with delicate sensibilities. I'm 24 years old and extremely liberal-minded, but I wouldn't give this set to a kid. If you're buying this for your 16-year-old grandkid because you saw NIN stickers on her stuff... well, you are so much cooler than my grandparents! But just know that back when they had X ratings, this probably would have gotten one. <p>That said, I don't want to discourage anyone. If you're a 16-year-old NIN fan, just promise not to go on some crazed Happiness in Slavery rampage, or it'll be Judas Priest all over again.

 | product/productId: 0790749343 | review/userId: A3M4QGREWR0Z3O | review/summary: Batman Beyond's Battles In Hill High's Love Wars | review/text: Batman Beyond: Crush is basically a sequel to BB: School Dayz, in that these three episodes once again dip into Terry McGuiness/Batman's interaction with his high school peers.  <p>However, I didn't like two of  these episodes as much as I thought I would.  Not that they are all that  weak, but they lack some of the edge that made School Dayz so effective, an  edge that is maintained in Spellbound.<p>&quot;Rats&quot; and &quot;Terry's  Friend Dates A Robot&quot; are the tape's weaker episodes.  &quot;Robot,&quot; while not as satisfying as an episode like  &quot;Spliced,&quot; is still quite funny.  It starts with an outstanding  sequence - a sim battle between Terry and several of Bruce Wayne's old  adversaries - the Riddler, Two-Face, Killer Croc - in synthoid robot form.  The company that makes Bruce's sim robots also makes illegal  &quot;escort&quot; robots; when Hill High's resident fat nerd Howard Groote  discovers this fact, he purchases a synthoid girl - named (what else?)  Cynthia - with which he shows up the school's &quot;in&quot; crowd.  This,  though, gets him and everyone else in trouble, as we see a desturctive new  twist on the term &quot;A woman scorned....&quot;<p>&quot;Rats&quot; has an  intriguing premise - a mutant ratboy who lives in Gotham's sewers  surrounded by outsized rodents kidnaps Terry's sometime girlfriend Dana Tan  (voiced by Lauren Tom) in order to make her his companion.  The episode  features an effective sequence where Dana crawls through the sewer in an  ultimately vain attempt to escape the ratboy.  <p>The lesser of the  episode's twin weaknesses are that the ratboy doesn't get quite enough  screentime to register a full impact with the viewer.  This, though,  doesn't compare with the larger weakness - I just don't like the Dana Tan  character.  In previous episodes she has consistently come across as snooty  and somewhat self-centered; it shows even at the end when she sobs on  Terry's shoulder.  She's not likeable enough for people to believe Terry  should waste any time with her, yet at the same time she's not hateable  enough for the audience to feel enough guilty pleasure at seeing her  humiliated.<p>Perhaps sensing that Dana Tan isn't enough of a character to  spend too much time with, the show also has Terry palling around with  another young lady, Max (Cree Summer), who is far more sympathetic, and  also knows Terry's secret, which she uses to help Terry with his crime  fighting in the tape's best episode, the very good &quot;Once Burned.&quot;  This is a sequel to &quot;Dead Man's Hand&quot; and returns The Royal  Flush Gang and Terry's most passionate girlfriend, Melanie Walker - aka  Ten.  Ten is robbing an underworld card game - similar to the one from the  Batman: The Animated Series classic &quot;Almost Got 'im!&quot; - for  ransom money to pay The Jokerz, who are holding her family hostage.  Batman  stops her, but when he attacks The Jokerz' damside hideout, he finds he's  been doublecrossed.  Even more, he's not the only one who's been  doublecrossed.<p>The best scene here comes when Melanie reunites with  Terry.  After they kiss, they talk about their previous encounter - this  leads to a cute &quot;cheap thrill&quot; edit; when Melanie asks Terry if  he still finds her attractive, he affirms that he does, as the camera pans  upward following Melanie's figure.<p>George Lazenby - James Bond in On Her  Majesty's Secret Service - returns as King, while Sara Douglas - Ursa from  the Superman movies - replaces Amanda Pays as Queen.

Sometimes we need a childs point of view in life and show us the real  meaning what love and what it is all about. Children stay children and even  adults can become children, but they loose their sence of innocence. That  is what makes this movie so touching is the fact that the love for Matilda  was unconditional and the feeling was mutual. He was willing to take his  own life to give Matilda hers. I would advise anyone who is anyone to watch  this movie.

 | product/productId: 0767838963 | review/userId: A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T | review/summary: Clever sci-fi suspense with some twists | review/text: This movie is a clever tale of virtual realities within virtual realities within virtual realities, ad infinitum.  But that's not apparent at the beginning so forget I mentioned that if you are a new viewer of the film.  It starts off as a mystery story in a virtual world set in an historical backdrop.  But things are not what they seem.  Comparisons to the Matrix are not totally unfounded, but there are stark differences to the tone and story of these films.  The 13th floor has a great ending that does leave you thinking hmmmm....  I enjoyed it but can see how it lacks the style and clever symbolism and dialogue that have made Matrix films such a big phenomenon.  If you like this genre this is a terrific film to see and get you thinking about the nature of reality and what it would be like to be an artifically generated intelligence.

It is touching and hilarious.  What a combination of brilliant actors and actresses, too!  The chemistry between all of them is incredible.  For an old movie fan, this movie is very special.  I think it is worth having a copy of your own.  There are things in it that resonate now, especially the relationships between women and men, even if the ideas in it and some scenes seem unreal.  That is not a drawback at all to enjoying it.  In fact, it might appeal to you that it is a bit unrealistic and "dreamy," so to speak.  This movie is also thought provoking and will not be forgotten.

Yes, the movie is set up on the time-worn premise of greed getting you into life threatening danger, but the cast makes it work. It's nice to see a group of people that keep their wits about them, and not just become mindless screaming bags of flesh when confronted with danger. You have your mix characters that you want to see get eaten, and those you want to live.
 | product/productId: 6302426197 | review/userId: A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL | review/summary: Taps Your Funny Bone | review/text: "This Is Spinal Tap" is a fun satire.  It is as obvious as it is freewheeling, but it hits its bullseye and never stops.  Rob Reiner, who directed and was contributing writer to this extravaganza, plays the interviewer making a "Rockumentary" of the title named band from England.  The disparity between the interviews and the behind the scenes debacles is telling.  Mercilessly, the contradictions poke fun at the pretenses and the self-importance of a successful band hitting the skids.  There are also occasional flashbacks to earlier incarnations of the group and its music that parody different movements in rock history.  The songs, especially the lyrics, nail the music on its head.  "...Spinal Tap" does for heavy metal what "Nashville" does for country, except the songs are far better here.<br /><br />The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, so we're seldom beat over the head, but it isn't breezy, either.  "This Is Spinal Tap" is an infectious parody of heavy metal bands and a fun movie that makes it all seem so easy.
 | product/productId: 0792837533 | review/userId: A27UWBI2R985CM | review/summary: Once in the "Highlands". | review/text: Vincente Minnelli's film of Brigadoon suffers greatly from its reliance on studio recreations of the Scottish Highlands. Instead of shooting on location, MGM provided very fake-looking scenery and landscapes, and although these perhaps add to the image of Brigadoon as a mythical town, they nevertheless rob the film of its potential grandeur. Additionally, the score is mutilated; 6 songs were cut from the original Broadway score, including the rapturous "Come to Me, Bend to Me", the lovely 2nd act duet between Tommy and Fiona ("From This Day On"), and the 2 'naughty' songs for Meg, the town squeeze. Gene Kelly is outstanding as Tommy, and the very flexible Cyd Charisse makes a wonderful leading lady, despite her dubbed singing voice. Their dance sequences are the film's most beautiful moments. Van Johnson provides some welcome humor that counteracts Kelly's dreamy and relaxed manner, and the cast as a whole performs with zest and folksey charm. Still, the film, despite its widescreen splendor and expert direction, is overall an underwhelming presentation of one of the musical theater's great shows.

 | product/productId: 6300158624 | review/userId: A2D37EP9KT2E3D | review/summary: McCarthy-era Melodrama | review/text: In the aftermath of the second world war, paranonia became one of the major features of American culture. There were conspiracies everywhere. While the politics of paranoia are usually associated with anti-communism, it did exist in many other forms at the time. The Stranger is one example of that paranoia.<br /><br />Rather than seeing communists under every bed and in every closet, there were some like Orson Wells who saw fascists. What is most remarkable is how similar the mindset and the logic is. There is always the unseen enemy within. There is always the idea of innocent american values being corrupted. There is always the idea of the foreign threat to the all-american ideal. And the idea of the secret conspiracy that aims to overthrow civilization itself. The ultimate observation being that the paranoid mindset was pervasive across American culture of that era.<br /><br />The film is basically a old fashioned melodrama with archtype characters. We have the ideal New England town full of ideal Americans. But in its midst is an evil foreign looking european clock tower. The symbolism isn't exactly subtile. Nothing in the film is very subtile.<br /><br />Our villian here is a teacher (corrupting the virtuous American young) who is marrying the pure innocent daughter (corrupting the virtues of our innocent American women) whose father is the local judge (the corruption reaches into the law and the upper class).<br /><br />A group of nazi-hunters tracks a low-level nazi hoping they will lead them to a upper-level nazi. The upper-level nazi turns out to be our villian living in New England. We then get to the real melodrama. Welles chews the scenery and twirls his non-existent mustache. He tries so hard to be evil that he ends up going way over the top. The low point has him poisoning a dog to cover his tracks.<br /><br />The film has logic problems all over the place. Welles is supposed to have been a high-ranking nazi. But yet we are told that even after having found him, there is simply no way to identify him or do anything about him. This justifies a further roll down the paranoia path. Rather than just arresting the exposed nazi criminal (which the film claims is impossible), the people around him have to be "turned". Its a very HUAC/McCarthy kind of logic that has little to do with the pursuit of nazi war criminals.<br /><br />The anti-communist hunters had similar problems. They could track down suspected communists. But only through the confessions of others before the committee could they positively identify them publically as communists. The logic of the film anticipates the logic of the House Unamerican Activities committee a few years later.<br /><br />The film also unfortunately moves into Welles' other preoccupation of that time seen sometimes in his newspaper columns. That the occupation regime in Germany in the immediate postwar period was nowhere near harsh enough. That Germans as a whole had some basic drive toward world conquest and that fascism had some ethnic component to it leading all germans inevitably toward a revival of nazism. In seeing fascism in these terms, he significantly undermines the anti-fascist message of his works and specifically undermines "the stranger". Seeing fascism as an ethnic disease rather than a political idea seems very naive and very foolish today.<br /><br />The film moves on to a sort of conclusion. WASP womanhood turns against nazism and saves the day only after discovering that the nazi plans to kill her as well. We get a good action sequence in the clock tower to wrap things up. But the path taken to get there is rather contrived and silly.<br /><br />It would have been a better film if it had stuck to a no-nonsense story of tracking down a war criminal. The whole theme of corruption, the conspiracy and the hidden enemy within doesn't add anything good. It would have also been better if (for example) Loretta Young had turned against him because he was a war criminal rather than because he was going to kill her.<br /><br />In terms of the other aspects of the film, it was another step down from Welles' previous work. The music is a step down. The camera work is a step down. Judged by the standards of the average second rate studio melodramas of the era, its a good film. As a work that aspires higher than that, it has lots of issues.

The special effects, when compared to other films of the genre, simply blow  them out of the water when you consider the technology of the day. Many  movies about that time refer to the 1990's as the period when humanity  reached other stars or similar feats, but the realism of putting that  discovery nearly a century past that only helps to make it more realistic.  I strongly urge any sci-fi fan who has not seen this movie to go out and  rent, buy, or tape it off of AMC.

It was adapted for the screen from the hit Broadway musical by Rodgers & Hammerstein.

If you've never seen it, (and it's hard to believe anybody hasn't,) you owe it to yourself.  It's one of the great classic films of all time.

 | product/productId: 0800197917 | review/userId: A3DSTOJPRMV674 | review/summary: Yet must I not give Nature all, thy Art? | review/text: The multiple chords struck by Carrol Ballard's heartbreaking work &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; are so universal, it is difficult to imagine a person of any gender or any age not being touched in some way by this genuine family film. Make no doubt, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is a true classic, timeless in beauty yet timely in theme. So many subjects are tackled, from estranged family dynamics to environmental messages, it is difficult to fully grasp this film's important impact from just one viewing. Each time I view this movie, I come away with new ideas, and a new hope for our common man and woman.<p>Film director Carrol Ballard has achieved such lofty heights before with his debut film &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and his stunning follow-up &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Amazingly, he has once again climbed to the top of a very high mountain with &quot;Fly Away Home.&quot; The story is anything but simple, but its a tale of a mother, lost in a car accident, thereby forcing the reunion of a daughter and estranged father. He's an eccentric Canadian, living in the country, working on multiple sculptures and experimenting with flying machines. She's a lost soul, seemingly homeless without the guidance of her late mother. Yes, father (Jeff Daniels) and daughter (Anna Paquin) bond, but it's due to the nature which surrounds their rural homestead. In this case, an orphaned flock of geese Paquin raises from birth after the destruction of their natural habitat by encroaching development.<p>Paquin's character becomes a surrogate mother for these geese, and eventually she must learn to fly to enable the lost birds to travel south for the winter. Daniels accompanies his daughter out of love, and eventually understanding that this has become a rite of passage for his budding, maturing teenage girl. And somewhere along the way, a girl becomes a woman, and a father becomes a man.<p>Much of the credit for &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; goes to the brilliant cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who also worked with Ballard on &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Certainly the musical selection of Mary Chapin Carpenter's haunting &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; is an inspirational if not brilliant choice. But the story is the key, and during a time of changing family dynamics amidst a society of shrinking nature, I can't imagine a film utilizing both themes with such skilled and relevant ease.<p>&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is such an important film, not only because a female protagonist breaks away from traditional bonds to find herself (no boy and his dog here), but because a self-centered man/father overcomes his weaknesses to find not only himself, but the person/daughter/child who defines his soul. &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is about us finding our spirit during a trying time of divorce and misguided independent values. By bonding with the land, and as importantly with our family, we find our true spirit.<p>And finally, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; will bring a tear to the most hardened spirit, causing us to hug the ones we love, human or animal. Is that not the purpose of art - film, book, music or otherwise? I have applauded Carroll Ballard before. After &quot;Fly Away Home,&quot; I not only applaud this extraordinarily gifted director, I salute him.

But this movie is about an amazing guy.  Tony Melendez is a musician who sings and plays guitar with his FEET!  He was born without hands due to his mother being prescribed thalidomide.<p>The above short summary sounds so knee-jerk over sold.  But, the movie presents him as a real person who was drifting along but generally ok in his life - until he realized he could make a living singing and playing.  Then he met the pope and became a celebrity of sorts, and seems to have a very healthy warm music ministry.  In other words, he seems to be presented fairly and authentically.<p>I thought the movie was well done and the story was told honestly and movingly.  WELL WORTH WATCHING.

 | product/productId: 0790733927 | review/userId: A16CZRQL23NOIW | review/summary: Beckett in New York! | review/text: From the first time I watched this movie, came to my mind the absurd theater, so well expressed in the middle of the thirties when some part of the rationality in the world had just taken a rest that endured almost eighty years. The decision to steal a bank without any prevision state, where the Kafka desperation,  the Sartre anxiety and the Camus ontological loneliness, shook hands. The reflected  microcosms showed a city in serious mental, existentialist and spiritual wounds originated for so many failures. Vietnam and its circumstances,  Watergate, the ideological sons of Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, the nostalgic gaze of Kerouac and Ginsherg,  and the oil crisis of 1973 became a true cresol that determined many living crossroads.<br /><br />Lumet decided to film a portrait of the most profound loneliness between a male couple. But this mistake thriller is a metaphor of the whole mess in those difficult years all over the world. The terrorism played pitifully a first rate role: the Munich affair in 1972, The Symbiotic Liberation Army, the racial conflicts in South Africa, the increasing migration to Europe, the intestine conflicts in the far East, and the spouted insurrectional Governments based on Marxist currents in Center and South America, conformed such collective tension state that practically there was not any little corner in the world free of problem.<br /><br />That's why the claustrophobic environment that surrounds the whole film from start to finish. And forget the typical happy ending. If there was a decade in which USA reflected the crude reality in all its implacable and fierce nakedness was in the Seventies.

 | product/productId: 1572522356 | review/userId: AKS9SJTHTU0OM | review/summary: Entertaining, original, challenging, if not quite a masterpiece | review/text: I feel downright churlish for not going completely crazy for this funny/sad look at movie-making -- specifically the rather absurd, doomed remaking of a real French classic, by an aging, out of style art-house director, starring Hong Kong action heroine Maggie Chung, who plays herself delightfully.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film; its sort of a complex 1990s `Day for Night', with a paradoxical and sometimes confusing point of view about the nature of art and the state of film.<br /><br />But I couldn't see it for the masterpiece a number of intelligent critics gave it credit for being.  Jonathan Rosenbaum, the terrific critic from the Chicago Reader wrote a very long, in depth analysis that went right over my head, and then added insult to injury by implying that people who don't see the film as<br />a deep investigation of the evils of capitalism, and the meaning of ART are somehow shallow.<br /><br />I'm also surprised by the number of people who take the ramblings of an obnoxious reporter in the film about the death of French art cinema as being the film's point of view on these issues.  To me the film isn't taking sides, and seems to be gently satirizing, and yet embracing all of film.<br /><br />Good natured, well acted, and occasionally brave (but also occasionally obscure) I quite enjoyed this and it did provoke some thinking.  But I couldn't see it as the super deep film some did. For me, it was fun, but the ideas are far less deep or radical then critics seem to want to give them credit for being.

Its so well done that a tiny bit of me converts, I swear to god, at least for the duration of the flick.  Explains a lot about what I like about Mormons!<br /><br />Its also a great adventurous tale of pioneering in the olden days when men were men....  The special effects are quite good.  Tyrone Power, great as always, and the the woman who plays Zina is hard to forget and very convincing.  But maybe I just go in for this sort of somewhat cheesy American individualist against the elements, Oregon Trail, thing.<br /><br />Terrific for late night drinking and rainy afternoons and to inspire that long lost American Pioneer in you.  I'm serious!<br /><br />Enjoy.

But a classic like "AFRICAN QUEEN" can sit in company archives and if released on disc would surely mean a nice piece of change in many pockets.<br /><br /> I wouldn't mind if it showed up on cable and I was able to record it with my DVD Recorder,but it hasn't even been broadcast in months.<br /><br /> How can this happen?

It shows that having a baby is not easy,but it's a good movie(rare in hollywood known for it's "cool" anti-life message and bias.)At least that's the feel I get from this movie,they have their ups and down like in real life.
 | product/productId: 0790731932 | review/userId: A11ISKJV4Q21KA | review/summary: GR8 'poplyptic' Flick | review/text: Fantastic sci-fi 'rough' visuals and story line; after an apparent World War 3, Max (Mel Gibson) is one of the few survivors in a apopalyptic Australia. Max fights the elements, a 'dog-eat-dog' world of (needfully) ruthless survivalists, and his own morals/ethics to survive and aid a band of youngsters. Good plot, filmography, acting, and directing. I'd give it five stars, but its only in my top 20, not my top 10. I am picky though.

 | product/productId: 0767816617 | review/userId: ALIPCX196T3LP | review/summary: 5 Star Movie!!!  3 Star DVD special features = 4 Star DVD | review/text: One of the best &quot;teen comedies&quot; out there.  It is about Preston (Ethan Embry of Empire Records, another good film) who sees &quot;fate&quot; work in his favor once again as Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the girl of his dreams since freshman year, breaks up with her boyfriend.  Preston sees the post graduation party as his last opportunity to tell Amanda that they are meant for each other before leaving town the next morning.  The rowdy, alcohol filled post-graduation monster party if filled with hillarious scenes and substories which include:  Special K(Seth Green) and Denise (Lauren Ambrose) locked in a bathroom together and Nerdy William (Charlie Korsmo) seeking revenge on his jock nemisis Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli). <p>Basically this movie is all about &quot;fate&quot;.  There is a whole part of the movie devoted to fate when Jenna Elfman gives the moral of the movie &quot;There is such a thing as fate, but it only takes you so far, once you're there its up to you to make it happen&quot;.  Advice that everyone should take to heart.  This movie is a 5, no question in my mind because of the memorable quotes, scenes, and performances.  <p>If you buy DVD's just for the special features you will be disappointed with this one.  As a DVD , this DVD is really lacking.  The only extras that it has are the trailer, a Smashmouth music video, commentary, and photo gallery.  This DVD would have received 5 stars if only there were a cheesy but entertaining &quot;making the movie featurette&quot; and especially deleted/changed scenes.  3 stars for the DVD with minimal special features.  Even though this DVD is really lacking, I highly recommend buying this movie and hope in the future that they come out with a &quot;Special Edition&quot; of this DVD because it really deserves it.

At first you may find it a mistake that anyone could love or even like this movie, but once you get about half way through, you'll understand. I saw this movie many years ago and to this day I think about how funny some of the scenes and lines were. Classic B or C movie. Add it to your collection.

 | product/productId: 0780624548 | review/userId: AM68RIPCVOIXS | review/summary: Possibly the Best Film of the 90s! | review/text: This came out in 1997 - the year of Titanic-mania - and years from now, I believe film historians will be scratching their heads trying to figure out how James Cameron's super expensive blockbuster won the Oscar for Best Picture while this wasn't even nominated. I've watched Boogie Nights dozens of times now, and it has become one of the most cherished films I own. I ought to point out that the actual making of porn films has very little to do with the story this film tells. It has more to do with the porn film environment - the parties, the lifestyle, and most importantly the personalities. Overall, it feels like a story about how the 70s turned into the 80s and how hard it was for this group of people to adjust once everything the 70s meant for them just up and vanished. The good life has a downward slope. But on the way to the 80s there are so many wonderful scenes with such wonderful dialogue and humor, supported by an amazing cast (so many actors in Boogie Nights have become stars in their own right that I doubt any producer could afford to assemble this group again). A highlight for me is Mark Whalberg and John C. Reily recording a cheesy rock album (with such inspired lyrics; "My heat will rock you, my heat will roll you;" "You got the touch, you got the power!") and then trying to convince the studio owners to give them the tapes they haven't paid for. Burt Reynolds turns in his best work since Deliverance. Julianne Moore is wonderful. Reily and Whalberg are hilarious throughout. The time period is re-created with loving care; fashions, decor and detail from the era are plentiful. This is such great storytelling! There are many individual storylines, but they all complement each other beautifully. It's hard to say how much the plot was influenced by real life stories, although it does seem like the coke-fueled shootout near the end may have been suggested by John Holmes notorious involvement with a murder around the same early 80s period. Director P. T. Anderson is in full Scorcese emulation mode, and I think it pays off. What can I say; this film is a feast.
 | product/productId: 6302131030 | review/userId: A12AZKI46Q8ZER | review/summary: well done but too nasty | review/text: I liked this movie very much, except the parts that made me want to vomit. I've never seen a film like it, in that it depicts realism in many ways -- real people in realistic situations. I liked the confrontation between medieval and renassance mindsets. We see that in the way young Stephen thinks differently from everyone else. Sometimes that only gives him trouble fitting in and sometimes it's just what the situation requires, but he is always going solo with his thoughts. I also liked how he put all that aside when it came time to just bear down and get through a life-or-death situation, which he did by both thinking and fighting his way out. Also interesting was Agnes' constant failures to choose which way to go. She wasn't mature enough to know who she is and always wanted to have it both ways, which was the cause of much of the story's conflicts.<br />It was just too foul and disgusting. Around every corner was a rape or a murder or a dead baby. Paul Verhoven is a talented man with some serious demons in him. I will really be glad to have this movie in my personal favorites when I can do a little editing.
 | product/productId: 6300270122 | review/userId: A259W5KIP41XFL | review/summary: Okay, this is where the Superman series starts to get stupid | review/text: This is Superman III, the third entry in the franchise, and probably the silliest. August ''Gus'' Gorman (Richard Pryor) was looking for a job and found one at a computer company run by a corrupt millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn), his younger sister Vera (Annie Ross), and girlfriend Lorelei Ambrosia (Pamela Stephenson). Meanwhile, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) convinces Perry White (Jackie Cooper) to let him attend his High School Reunion in Smallville, while Lois (Margot Kidder) goes on a vacation to Bermuda. At the reunion, he was reunited with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) who is now a mother to Ricky (Paul Kaethler). At Ricky's birthday party, Gus and Vera, in disguise as soldiers give Superman a messed-up chunk of Kryptonite in an attempt to kill him, but due to a minor component modification, it causes him to slowly go crazy. He became negligent at his duties and messed things up by causing an oil spill and moving the Leaning Tower of Piza straight. Then the gang plot to use the satellites to control Earth's weather. When Superman sank into alcoholism and depression in front of everyone, Ricky pleads for him to snap out of it and that plea gives him the strength to fight it. It causes him to split into two personas, the evil version Vs. Clark Kent. Clark successfully defeats his evil clone and goes to redeem himself by fixing everything, stopping the three villains, and saving Gus. In the series, this entry was okay, but the jokes and the intro were cornier. Richard Pryor was alright, but not that funny compared to his stand-up routines, and he and Richard Lester are better off in comedy films. It did have some neat ideas, like Superman saving a chemical plant from a fire, for example. Christopher Reeve's performance as a corrupted version of Superman and the battle of both versions is the highlight of this entry. Unless you are a true D.C. Comics fan, please rent this one before you buy it.
 | product/productId: 6301569385 | review/userId: AKD3SN5OPY5DM | review/summary: I love JOHN CANDY | review/text: This is a favorite of mine because it shows how understanding, love, compassion &  humor go hand-in-hand.  John Candy is wonderful as "Uncle Buck", the kids are so cute, "Tia" is very good at conveying the teen-age rebellion that is so rampant today.<br />The actor who plays "BUG" is also very good in his role as a cowardly & selfish teen who tries to impress girl teens & gets away with his "come on" manner. But he gets his come-uppance under Uncle Buck's "deliverance".  All in all it is a very good movie, it makes you feel good when it's over.
 | product/productId: 0780020820 | review/userId: A2GCHG6U8HTVIT | review/summary: An interesting Kurosawa film about corporate corruption, with a fine performance by Toshiro Mifune | review/text: Despite many good elements, The Bad Sleep Well is one Kurosawa movie that didn't involve me much, either emotionally or in the story telling. I've always found it hard to take seriously movie stories where the villain, either an individual or an organization, is so all-powerful and so competent that he or it simply can't be touched. Here we have a tale of massive corporate corruption in post-war Japan which is led by an unseen evil which can arrange not just for suicides, blackmail, murder and the cover ups, but for all those messy details like cleaning up afterwards and immaculate body disposal. Bureaucratic self-sacrifice is the expected behavior of subordinates, when necessary. As one character says, "You don't understand bureaucrats. A good official never implicates a superior, no matter what the cost." For me, the pervasive success of the bad ones doesn't lead to great drama or to wrenching, paranoid discovery, but just to melodrama,<br /><br />Adding to the distance I felt is the behavior of the...well, not hero, exactly. Protagonist? Nishi (Toshiro Mifune) is so consumed by revenge that he unhesitatingly takes upon himself the role of judge and executioner, destroying many of those around him who are either innocent of anything other than loving him or who are small potatoes in the schemes of corruption. And the Mr. Bigs? Nishi tells us "Even now they sleep soundly, with grins on their faces. I won't stand for it! I can never hate them enough!" Do the ends justify the means? I seldom think so, certainly not in a movie, yet it is difficult to feel sympathy for Nishi unless we're willing to give that question the benefit of the doubt. In the last quarter of the movie, when Nishi softens a bit and even seems of the verge of success with no further great violence, I think I had just spent too much time finding his obsession with revenge tiring.<br /><br />That last quarter brings things into focus in ways that make at least some of the preceding time seem unnecessary. Still, Nishi's feeling about his wife, his questioning of his own methods, his background, all brought him into a more interesting light, where before he simply seemed to me a creature of obsession and ruthlessness.<br /><br />The film opens with a great-story setting scene. Everything we need to know about the plot is given to us here, largely by exposition from some reporters. We're at the elaborate wedding dinner of Nishi and the daughter of a senior officer of a large construction company. We see and learn about the corrupt characters and the background of corruption. We see notes being passed, a police inspector showing up, reporters talking to themselves (and to us). We see the strangely expressionless face of Nishi. We see a large cake decorated to look like an office building come rolling in right after the wedding cake, and we note a red rose sticking out from a seventh floor window of the cake. We learn this represents the window where five years earlier a mid-level bureaucrat jumped to his death. And off we go into the rest of the tale.<br /><br />Mifune does a terrific job as Nishi. He made Nishi's obsession believable. I also liked very much Takashi Shimura's portrayal of Moriyama, the obsequious and reliable bureaucrat, and Tatusuya Mihashi as Nishi's brother-in-law. Probably the most thankless role was played by Kyoko Kagawa as Nishi's wife. She noted in an interview on the disc that almost every emotion her character felt had to be shown indirectly and with reserve. She does a fine job.<br /><br />Don't mistake me; the movie is interesting and the story keeps moving ahead. Just don't expect a Kurosawa masterpiece. If at all possible, don't read the two essays in the booklet that accompanies the disc. The one written by Chuck Stephens, identified as a contributing editor to something called Film Comment, is particularly mannered and pretentious. With their labored pedantry and jarring attempts at similes and alliteration, the essays do the film no good service.<br /><br />The Criterion DVD picture looks just fine. The important extra is a 33-minute documentary on the making of the film. Several of the actors look back and comment on their roles and what it was like working with Kurosawa.
 | product/productId: 0788811363 | review/userId: A133T07WO5KYX3 | review/summary: A dreamlike distraction | review/text: The beauty in the filming this destined to be classic movie, wraps you in the feeling of flying over the open desert, the sands of the Sahara in an open-cockpit plane. You live the adventure of exploring and mapping Africa, feel the freedom of the men who lived it and the frustration of pointless nation-state borders over an endless rolling land.<br /> The myriad of contradictions in the modern era lay the backdrop and irony for this intricate and enticing film. It is poetic, it is sarcastic. It is time well-spent.
 | product/productId: 1560686413 | review/userId: A1WL5J91ND7KDK | review/summary: The Tai-Pan of the Noble House | review/text: I would definitely suggest that "Noble House" certainly surpasses its<br />original literary text. It was a very long novel and at times it felt tiring to read through all of the subplots and to go into detail about minor characters. I started to read the novel first but kept postponing to<br />continue with it, yet when I finally saw the mini-series I was completely<br />captivated and watched the first five hours in one night.<br /><br />Besides the additions and changes which enhanced the story to a<br />better level, I loved the cinematography of the scenes, particularly those<br />of Pierce (the use of panning and tracking shots in camera movement<br />seemed to gracefully glide with Ian which is symbolic of his character).<br />The musical themes were especially self-reflexive in the cinematic<br />medium; I loved how it depicted the grandeur of the role of Tai-pan of<br />the Noble House as well as the romance of the setting and the couples.<br /><br />Love the cliffhangers at the end of each episode, they always leave you<br />wanting to know what will happen next.  In terms of storytelling, the<br />main and subplots keep twisting and turning; either truly satisfying or<br />better than you would expect.  The trick is that sometimes the acting as<br />well as the cinematography work together to deceive the audience  i.e.<br />when there is a high angle shot of Ian's car driving through traffic, the<br />camera pulls back to reveal it is from Gornt's point of view, he smirks<br />which may imply he is involved with John's kidnapping.<br /><br />A rather brilliant restoration for such an epic mini-series!  The visual quality is nearly flawless, sharper and more stunning than I had anticipated (especially to see Pierce's blue eyes).  The sound is great:  I love the grand Tai-pan theme playing on the main menu as well as<br />Casey's romantic theme played during the scene selection<br />menus.  Otherwise, the clarity of sound effects, voices, and<br />instruments is wonderful.  Although I would've preferred<br />moving images from the film on the main menu.  Anyway, the<br />mini-series is divided up into four episodes, two on each disc.<br /><br />This is such a personal reward to me--I've been looking forward<br />to viewing this on DVD ever since I wrote the film analysis<br />article a few months back in honor of the 20th anniversary of its<br />broadcast on NBC.  It was my very first critique intended for<br />publication since I graduated from Rider University.  Actually,<br />I decided to write the analysis right after I realized there were<br />plans for this official release.  Perhaps it was joss after all!
 | product/productId: 1433512041 | review/userId: AJ29RTD5EIN78 | review/summary: Pertinent Propositionalism and Passionate Pastoring... | review/text: I had high expectations for this book - I'll confess that I am fond of Driscoll.  For no other reason that he is a refreshing stream of absolutism in an otherwise ambiguous overly-artistic flowery world of words and images. He defines the 'X' in my generation.<br />However, the first chapter was a little disappointing.  If you're familiar with Driscoll, then you'll have heard his sermon at the 2006 Desiring God National Conference where he argued for a rigorous combining of biblical propositionalism and practical mission.<br />If you've heard that talk, then don't bother with the first chapter of Vintage Jesus - it's almost word for word.<br />But my consumer addictions aside, Vintage Jesus is more than just a doctrinal treatise on Reformed atonement theology; there are some very intimate insights into Driscoll as a pastor.  He is a man who clearly cares for those he leads, often teetering somewhere between valiant confidence and overwhelming despair.  Those moments in the book were quite touching - although I wouldn't tell Mark that!<br />The first page summarizes the book well: "This book is dedicated to anyone who takes Jesus seriously, but not themselves."

 | product/productId: 6301978374 | review/userId: A19IPAKY8ZFAKP | review/summary: Garbo &amp; Gilbert - best team ever - timeless | review/text: I loved this film, the only talking picture of the great Gilbert/Garbo team.  (You note I put his name first, because it appears like that in their three silent films!)<br />Contrary to the first review in this section, which states that Mr. Gilbert is almost &quot;laughable&quot; (?) in his role, I think his performance is excellent, like Ms. Garbo's, certainly better than Ian Keith's.  You can actually see on screen the great love that once existed between the two during all their classic, great silent films, and the chemistry is still there.  Makes one wish she had accepted one of his several (real) marriage proposals!<br />I am sick and tired of seeing Mr. Gilbert being maligned; he was one of the silent screen's best actors; his teaming with Ms. Garbo is timeless; and due to the machinations of a &quot;person&quot; named Louis B. Mayer, his career was deliberately ruined for several reasons, e.g. personal animosity between the two men (which twice led to blows), highest salaried contract,  relationship w/Ms. Garbo, etc.  Once and for all, let us finally put an end to the &quot;voice&quot; myth and realize the truth!<br />In summary, Ms. Garbo is perfect and she is here reunited with her perfect leading man.  Just as in the three silent films they made together, this one is a classic which will be remembered forever. Never again did she have a co-star so &quot;perfect&quot; with her.<br />P.S.  To the person who wrote &quot;laughable&quot;:  Ever hear about &quot;The Big Parade&quot; - maybe you should take a look at it to see how excellent an actor Mr. Gilbert was, and definitely view all of the Gilbert/Garbo silents.  You'll learn a lot.

 | product/productId: 6301963717 | review/userId: A1QFM9CFEUXZK5 | review/summary: Quirky Heartless Story of Quirky Heartless Characters | review/text: This is not a great movie.<br /><br />I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V3JGII">The Coen Brothers Movie Collection (Fargo / Miller's Crossing / Barton Fink / Raising Arizona / Blood Simple)</a> Blood Simple for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed watching Francis McDermott. She was fantastic in Fargo. Fargo was a great movie with all the right moves, excellent tone, bizarre characters, and a flatly affected but very strong pregnant cop played by McDermott. The Coen brothers are known for their slightly off-kilter films. Raising Arizona with Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter was a very successful and entertaining quirky movie. Strange characters and bizarre situations can be very entertaining. The formula just doesn't work in Miller's Crossing.<br /><br />Garbrial Byrne stars as a dirtball gangster. He's the slimey no. 2 to Albert Finney in Finney's massive gangster world. Finney is the real power in this mystery city and Byrne's authority and power comes from only the fact that he has Finney's confidence. Finney is the star of the movie for me. In this unnamed city, the mayor and the police chief are in his pocket until his rival "goes to war" with his gang and starts to get the upper hand.  Byrne is having a "liaison" with Albert Finney's galpal played ably by Marcia Gay Harden. Byrne is Finney's second in command, so his choice of girlfriend is highly questionable. Over the course of the convoluted plot and where dirtbags of all stripes show up and do their thing, Byrne is forced to kill a man to show his new pals that he is not a mole or traitor. Well, Byrne has a little itty bitty heart and lets the pathetic victim go so long as he disappears from town. The intended victim is his girlfriend's brother so it makes sense not to whack him.<br /><br />Byrne makes his way between the two warring gangs all the while trying to get some money to pay off his gambling debts. It's all really quite silly and meaningless. There are lots of false deep moments with characters pretending to have souls and more than one layer to their shallow characters but they can't quite pull it off. This is a movie populated with characters who are all essentially the same, completely corrupt-- with little or no ethics or care for anybody else but themselves.<br /><br />The main problem with quirky films is that they so often end badly. What I mean is that the filmmakers don't quite know how to conclude the story or they purposefully leave the ending obscure just so they can retain their "quirky" reputations.<br /><br />Why is it seen as something of a failure in modern hollywood films to properly conclude a story? At one time, this was considered the mark of a well-constructed story--  one that has a beginning, middle, and end. Some "artists" apparently find the concept unfulfilling and perhaps even a bit constricting-- well, I want a proper ending to my stories! Why should the audience have to make up their own endings? It's just lazy story-telling disquised as avant-garde "art".<br /><br />The ending in this movie was completely frustrating. Nothing was wrapped up for the main characters (except those that got whacked) and what seems like a perfectly reasonable option presented to Byrne at the closing is rejected by him for no apparent reason. Finney's character doesn't quite understand the ending and neither do I. But Byrne is apparently motivated by other character traits that unfortunately nobody in the audience knows anything about.<br /><br />Folks in this movie don't learn alot, and don't change alot. It's just another "slice of life" in this particular weird, bizarro Coen brothers world.<br /><br />The film is beautiful to watch with lush dark colors everywhere. Everybody is wan and pale and even the scenery is washed out. The direction is excellent and the pacing fine. The performances are all adequate or better, but it's just not enough. The dialogue is stilted and terse. Albert Finney owns this movie and so does Marcia Gay Harden.<br /><br />Essentially, this approach to filmmaking and story telling is a treat for the filmmakers but a frustration for the audience. At the end of the movie I want to know what happens next, I want the storyline concluded, and I don't want to waste my time guessing and speculating about what happens to the characters after the credits because I really just don't care enough about the film or the shallow one or two dimensional characters to waste my time on the exercise.

Each brother attempts to find his place in the world whether it be with the accepted norms of society, the revolutionaries, or the extreme individualist anarcho-libertarian life.  Each pays a heavy price for his choice.  A moving tale of relationships, government, and belonging.  The Montana scenery is as much a star as any of the main characters.  A wonderful piece of work that will leave you pondering the intricate plot themes.
 | product/productId: 0792139771 | review/userId: A276IBEUJMDT6G | review/summary: Gibson at his best | review/text: Not going to go on and on about how great the movie is.....over 800 reviews and a 5 star rating already tells us this.  All I want to add is what I thought the best part of this DVD was.  The running commentary by Mel Gibson while the movie is being shown in sub titles and speech ( muted some while Gibson is speaking) is a stroke of genius !  I learned so much about how scenes were shot, how long it took to shoot a scene, insiders secrets, what parts of the movie Gibson liked the best  ( and not so much) and why.  I watch the movie at least once a week..... I am bedridden.....and episodic TV gets old very fast.  The only way I watch it now is with the commentary.  And for us women, while Wallace looks great in a kilt, Robert The Bruce looks great period.

 | product/productId: 0764004255 | review/userId: A2JJSCIGPZDWHI | review/summary: Great movie, wish this was a better version | review/text: OK, so I was never able to get the Anchor Bay DVD version of this film, although I do own the Collector's Edition VHS on Anchor Bay, which is in French with the English subtitles and three Rene Laloux animated shorts tagged at the end. I heard all about the problems of the Anchor Bay DVD about not being able to shut off the subtitles. I am also familiar with the standard English language VHS on Anchor Bay (without the animated shorts) which had subtitles too. There's also some earlier VHS editions that you probably should just avoid, because there are a few scenes that got hacked (United Home Video, for example).<br /><br />But I just got the new Accent Cinema DVD which has its goods and bads. One thing, the controls are faulty, you can't return to the menu by pusing the "menu" button, which seems weird (I am able to return to the menu by pushing the "top menu" button on my controller, but you're not able to return back where you left off). If Anchor Bay was able to treat us with three Rene Laloux animated shorts ("Les Dents du Singe", "Les Temps Mort", "Les Escargots"), why did Accent only provide us with one ("Les Escargots")? Also when you choose the Special Features, they also let you turn on or off the subtitles or have it in English or French, but the big problem is you can only choose one, then it goes immediately to the movie (you'd have to choose the other by pushing the "subtitle" or "audio" button on your remote control when the movie plays). Plus the English audio gets out of sync later on in the film (ie. you hear the talking but the lips are not moving for about one second after), which never did on the old English language VHS on Anchor Bay.<br /><br />Now for the good: you are now able to turn on and off the subtitles, and switch between English and French. That's great for those who were used to hearing this film in English in the old days when the USA Network would air this on Night Flight, or in French to see how the voices were originally like, and of course those bothered by the Anchor Bay version where you couldn't turn off the subtitles. And you also get to hear an interview from Ren&eacute; Laloux (did before his passing) and about how he got into animation, and how Fantastic Planet came to be. I was a bit surprised to find out he never had much joy making any of these films, aside from Les Dents du Singe.<br /><br />There's also a music video, "Would I Be the One", a Marc Bolan song recorded by Sean Lennon (as everyone knows, John Lennon's only son from his marriage to Yoko Ono - yes, I'm fully aware of Julian Lennon, he was from a previous marriage). The reason for it is the video features animation that was obviously inspired by Fantastic Planet (the Draags this time around have more than two eyes). And I have to say the music is actually quite good, I can detect some of that Beatles influence in it (but not a full copy), but I guess Marc Bolan had the Beatles in mind writing that song, and of course, Sean Lennon being related to a Beatle sure helps.<br /><br />Now on to the film. I was one who first unintentionally caught this movie on Night Flight back in the late '80s and I was completely blown away by the sci-fi imagery, the funky '70s music from Alain Goraiguer (sounding like Pink Floyd meets Isaac Hayes' "Shaft" to me) and the animation which was so far removed from the usual high-paced animation one is so accustomed to (such as Disney). Since that time, I had rarely seen it (because no station would air it since Night Flight left), until I acquired the VHS copy in 2000, and now the Accent Cinema DVD.<br /><br />Right away, you know this isn't a Disney animation for the kids. It's a rather unusual sci-fi film based on a Stefan Wul novel from 1957, Oms en S&eacute;ries (unfortunately never translated in English, so you better know French to be able to read that book). It's basically Oms (apparently descendants of Terrans who fled Planet Earth) who are being kepts as pets by giant blue-skinned Traags, until one Om gets a Traag learning device, which causes a revolt. The film was started in Czechoslovakia, but funding stopped due to the 1968 Soviet invasion, and the fact the communists likely deemed this movie anti-communist, so the film had to be completed in France (you have to bear in mind the Soviet Union at that time was under Leonid Brezhniv who basically wanted to bring the Soviet Union back to the bad old days of Stalinism, and didn't like how Czechoslovakia was becoming more democratic). Because of this, it's little wonder it took until 1973 before it finally got released. If it weren't for the political turmoil of Czechoslovakia at the time, not to mention budget problems, the movie would have likely been released in 1969 or 1970 (and the music probably would had a more late '60s psychedelic sound, rather than early '70s funk).<br /><br />There's no getting over the fact the movie really depicted an alien planet full of wonder and of danger full of creatures that hardly look like anything on Earth. This is sure unlike a lot of sci-fi I've seen of recent where everything looks gloomy and depressing. Then you have the wonderful psychedelic imagery, which I find so sorely lacking in most sci-fi, especially the post-Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind-era of sci-fi. And then the music, from Alain Goraiguer. I'm pretty certain had it not been for Isaac Hayes doing "Shaft", and a band like Pink Floyd starting to make it big (The Dark Side of the Moon came out earlier the same year as Fantastic Planet), we would probably not get this wonderful funky music to go with it. I'm certain that both Pink Floyd and "Shaft" were a big inspiration for the soundtrack. The great news was EMI/Path&eacute; Marconi had released a soundtrack album, but that LP has since became very rare and collectible, luckily a small label did reissue this on CD much more recently.<br /><br />Well, in conclusion, still hold on your Anchor Bay DVD, if you want to see "Les Dents du Singe" and "Les Temps Mort", but the Accent Cinema version is still worth getting for many of the great features, although they should have taken more time to iron out the flaws before releasing it. As for the film, it's one of the most unusual sci-fi films you'll ever hope to see, proving you can go far even on a low budget.
 | product/productId: 6300247171 | review/userId: A1QKCTSWTOOFRK | review/summary: Don't listen to the &quot;official&quot; reviews which appear above | review/text: Amazon's reviewer calls this movie overrated and drawn out, while the Leonard Maltin movie guide review seems a bit baffled that some people like this kind of entertainment.  Don't listen to either of them.  Alien is,  quite simply, one of the best movies ever made in both the sci-fi and  horror genres.  Those who complain that the film takes too long to get  going suffer from some kind of cinematic attention span disorder; Ridley  Scott draws his scenes out because he wants to build tension and establish  a sense of realism before introducing H.R. Giger's terrifying creation.  Unfortunately we can all see that the monster is just a guy in a suit  during the closing sequences when Scott finally lets us see what the big  slimy nemesis really looks like, but otherwise the film hasn't aged a bit  since it came out two decades ago.  The DVD is great too, with excellent  picture quality and a really great commentary track, despite some  disastrously inappropriate menu screens (the interfaces are all CG-rendered  glitz, which really doesn't go with a movie known for its slow, elegant,  quiet suspense).  Anyone with any interest in horror or science fiction  films in general should pick up this classic immediately.

Although, "The Dead Pool", manages to pull it off, in a big way, by incorporating, an interesting plot, with some good characters and a well executed film. Jim Carrey plays a heroin addicted rock star, and Liam Neeson, plays a filmmaker. Also, included is Guns N Roses, Welcome to the Jungle, song, which appears a couple of times in the film. Even Clint Eastwood, is back in rare form, on this film, the fifth one, in the "Dirty Harry" film series.
 | product/productId: 1558802533 | review/userId: A3C6TD8ZH4UHSO | review/summary: Early contender for blu-ray of the year | review/text: To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best American films I've ever seen. It's truly difficult to find fault in such an emotional, gripping, and touching story. The acting is fantastic (including some of the most natural child performances you've ever likely to see), the score is magnificent, and the film is very well-made.<br /><br />As part of Universal's 100th Anniversary, To Kill a Mockingbird has been given an all new restoration. The result is breathtaking. This is one of the clearest and most beautiful transfers for a film of this age I've seen. The sound, while slightly held back due to this being a 50-year old movie, also fares very well.<br /><br />This release is packed many worthwhile and insightful extras, particularly a feature-length documentary and commentary.<br /><br />A timeless masterpiece earns an equally impressive blu-ray release.

I can identify with the character when he goes through all his trials.<br /><br />I would listen to the CD over and over and watch the video as well.  I never get tired of it.  A great buy.

 | product/productId: 0764005022 | review/userId: A3M7GCMO507V89 | review/summary: Caine's best film | review/text: 'The Last Valley&quot; sunk almost without a trace back in the 70's when it was first released. The only comments I recall from that time were from  critics who mercilessly panned Michael Caine's accent.  It's difficult to  see just why the film failed. The script contains hardly a dull line,  Clavell's direction is very good, John Barry's score is quite simply superb  and the acting, with the exception of Arthur O'Connell and Christian  Roberts in minor roles, is first class. Michael Caine dominates the film  and gets some marvellous dialogue to utter. No wonder he rates his  performance so highly and no wonder he's registered profound disappointment  over the negative reviews. It just might be that because the script  vigorously berates both Catholic and Protestant religions with equal  disdain, the film found itself without a champion from either side to  defend it.  As for the score, I am at a loss to understand why it at least  was not nominated for the Academy Awards that year. John Barry is usually  terrific, but his score for &quot;The Last Valley&quot; is his best ever -  including &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.  The performance of Per  Oscarrson as the priest is memorable also. A wonderful film that sits  comfortably in my top 10 of all time.

 | product/productId: 6300185168 | review/userId: A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ | review/summary: The secret of the cipher | review/text: An arabesque is an artistic motif with repeating forms and patterns. It seems like the ideal title for the movie "Arabesque," a fun if repetitive little thriller about a professor thrown into international intrigue. The middle of this movie is light on plot, but there's plenty of action, romance, large machines, and a rather surprising twist at the end.<br /><br />At the behest of an Arab prime minister, Prof. David Pollock (Gregory Peck) is sent to spy on a corrupt businessman named Beshraavi (Alan Badel). Beshraavi needs a mysterious cipher decoded, and he keeps David a prisoner while he works on it. What's more, he plans to kill the professor once he's done.<br /><br />But David is able to escape with the help of Beshraavi's mistress, Yazmin (Sophia Loren) -- who turns out to have a secret agenda of her own. Now the professor must weave his way through enemies at every turn, along with the mystery woman he can't quite bring himself to trust. And if he doesn't decode the cipher in time, the entire world could be in jeopardy.<br /><br />"Arabesque" is a movie that doesn't know what to do with its middle section -- it starts off strong, spends a long time spinning its wheels, only to rise up and blossom again in the last twenty minutes. But if "Arabesque" is not a strong political thriller, it's certainly an enjoyable popcorn movie.<br /><br />The middle section of it isn't bad, just repetitive: scrabble for cipher, fight, follow, rinse, repeat. And they put in some... interesting padding to spice it up, such as a Big-Lipped Alligator Moment where a doped-up Peck meanders down a freeway, playing "matador" with the cars. That was a WEIRD scene.<br /><br />So what does it have that's good? Director Stanley Donen packs the movie with some pretty strong action scenes (wrecking ball, aquariums, a THRESHER!), some mild comic relief, and a brilliant double-twist in the last twenty minutes. And since this came right after Donen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001J3SVI">Charade</a>, we have some mildly witty banter and dialogue ("Let us through! That man's about to be killed!" "I hardly think so, sir. This is ENGLAND!").<br /><br />Peck and Loren have a fair amount of chemistry, and their characters are likable and pretty clever.  Loren plays up her charming sex appeal to the absolute max, and Peck plays David with the right mixture of competence and naivete. And Badel is absolutely spine-chilling as a calm, cool killer who never gets ruffled by anything, even as he prepares to shoot you in the head.<br /><br />The only problem is that I never entirely bought Peck and Loren's performances -- Peck is a bit too hard-edged for an academic nerd, and Loren's accent is this insane Italo-Anglo-Arab mutation that dies halfway through the movie.<br /><br />"Arabesque" has some flaws, but it's a fun little thriller with plenty of action, romance and some killer plot twists. Have plenty of popcorn ready before watching it.

This movie, which I do hope will be on DVD, is not shown enough on t.v. movie networks and i believe has never received the recognition it so deserves.

Tobey Maguire once again proves he  is Hollywood's finest actor at the moment (and trust me, I am as serious as  a heart attack when I say that) and Skeet Ulrich puts in another fine  performance. Jewel was equal  to the lead man and deserves all the kudos  she gets for which is certainly an underrated performance. I won't nag on  how this film deserved better than the reception it received in America  (and Europe for that matter) and also won't go crazy how Ang Lee, for a  second time was overlooked for an Oscar nomination for his flawless work.  Just watch this film, and savour up the glorious 2 hours in entertainment  it provides. Hands down, the best civil war film ever made.

The only ones of any merit were made during the war or in its aftermath and most were unbalanced, showing the Japanese as the  &quot;yellow peril,&quot; etc. I was raised on these movies and some of our  best directors cranked them out (John Ford and many others) and few stand  up well the test of time. Quite by accident I caught up to this fine film  on TV and then on this fine double video. The performances by the actors  are excellent. John Wayne shows facets of his character that I never saw  before, a vulnerabilty rarely seen other than the classic western &quot;The  Searchers,&quot; probably his best career performance. Kirk Douglas  delivers a great performance of a naval officer with an underlining  violence of character, which proves fatal to him. A fine supporting cast  headed up by Patricia O'Neil, Burgess Meredith, Tom Tryon and others fills  out the story, spread on a broad canvas by Otto Preminger. I was flat out  surprised by this excellent work, full of details, character developement,  and action. This really is'nt an action picture, with high heroics and flag  waving. By subduing these elements, a temptation for any director to boost  box office, Preminger achieves effects not seen in most big-budget  productions. The story is somewhat slow but rarely boring. The B&amp;W  photography posed no problem for me,for most of the war movies I saw as a  child were filmed in B&amp;W and it somewhat adds to the documentary look  of the movie. Almost all war movies use &quot;stock&quot; footage of ships  and battles and this movie is no different. The use of models in the  climactic battle is not very convincing; I read that Kirk Douglas said that  he liked the movie but seeing all those models with no crewmen standing on  deck bothered him, detracked from the power of the film. Jerry Goldsmith's  score is rousing without being bombastic, similar to his great  &quot;Patton&quot; score, another movie with some action but has great  emphasis on character. I would recommend this to all of John Wayne's fans.  Watch carefully; the Duke is showing some real acting talent here,  restrained for an officer named &quot;Rockwell.&quot; With so many epics  going for the blood and guts approach, &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; comes  sailing past with a more balanced picture, that the war was harsh, fought  by men, lower to upper ranks, but just men of flesh and blood, caught up in  the defining event of the twentieth century.
 | product/productId: 5552305965 | review/userId: A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ | review/summary: Floating in the sky | review/text: Steampunky airships, robots, sky pirates and an ancient city that floats in the sky -- even if it weren't a brilliantly-written movie, Hayao Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" would be a glorious experience. And fortunately this simple gem of a fantasy movie is triumphant in every way: vibrant animation, outstanding writing, and a brilliant mix of fiery action, comedy and a teeny bit of romance.<br /><br />After pirates raid an airship, a young girl named Sheeta escapes and falls from the ship... only to float down slowly to the ground, courtesy of a glowing crystal on her necklace. A miner boy named Pazu catches her and takes her home, and the two kids immediately become fast friends... but then the same sky pirates, working for their crabby mom Dola, have come searching for the crystal and Sheeta.<br /><br />It turns out that Sheeta's crystal is made of aetherium, a super-awesome mineral that powers the mythical floating city of Laputa, which the pirates are searching for. Pazu has a special interest in this city, since his father claimed to have seen it but was ridiculed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the pirates aren't the only ones after Sheeta. Both kids are apprehended by military forces led by the ruthless Muska, who has found a tangible relic that proves Laputa's existence -- an ancient robot that fell from the sky. Now Pazu must join forces with Dola and her bumbling sons to rescue Sheeta and find Laputa -- and if he doesn't stop Muska quickly, he will use Laputa for his own evil ends.<br /><br />"Castle in the Sky" is the sort of movie that a lot of people try to make, but only a rare few can actually pull off -- a richly imagined fantasy world with likable characters, and a powerful message about caring for the earth (which thankfully avoids being preachy). Not only does he succeed, but Miyazaki makes the whole thing seem effortless, weaving these themes together with a solid plot is both complex and refreshingly simple<br /><br />He also does an excellent job juggling comedy (Dola's goofy sons), a hint of romance, and a heavy dose of action -- lots of aerial battles, explosions, gun chases high-speed chases, and one harrowing scene where a broken robot follows Sheeta through a burning fortress. The script (both in English and Japanese) is written well with plenty of amusing moments ("Make your shirt explode!"), but also striking, moving ones, such as Sheeta's final monologue to Muska about the people of Laputa.<br /><br />The animation deserves a special shout-out -- it's rather simple and somewhat old-fashioned in style, but Miyazaki crafts a world of sunlit cliff-clinging villages, shadowy ruins full of roots, and shimmering seas under a vast swirling storm. And it's in exquisite bright colors that make it seem to have been painted on glass.<br /><br />Sheeta and Pazu are both likable, pure-hearted heroes for this story -- one a young girl troubled by her ancestral past, and one a hardworking boy determined to save her (and salvage his father's reputation). The gang of pirates are a fun bunch once they've left the "villain" zone, and Dola is a gloriously vivacious, gutsy old lady. And Muska makes an excellent villain for the piece -- amoral, intelligent, and honestly believing himself superior to others.<br /><br />"Castle in the Sky" is a truly enduring anime classic, a beautifully-animated tale of friendship, adventure and fantastical splendor. Do not give this a miss.

 | product/productId: 0783114389 | review/userId: ABH4G7TVI6G2T | review/summary: Frances Farmer's greatest performance/s | review/text: Another typical Edna Ferber story, with it's multi-generation characters and large doses of romance and fate.  COME AND GET IT is mainly notable for starring Frances Farmer in dual roles, plus fine turns from Edward Arnold and Joel McCrea.<br /><br />The setting is the logging community in Wisconsin.  Barney Glasgow (Edward Arnold) falls in love with gold-hearted saloon singer Lotta Morgan (Frances Farmer) but jilts her and instead marries into a rich and powerful family.  Many years later, Barney returns to discover Lotta--long dead--has a daughter that looks exactly like her, Lotta Bostrum (also played by Farmer).  Harbouring a strong infatuation for the younger Lotta, Barney's emotional turmoil is further compounded by his son Richard (Joel McCrea), who begins falling for her as well.<br /><br />COME AND GET IT is a finely-crafted romantic drama, and Frances Farmer gives a splendid performance as both incarnations of Lotta (simply by changing wigs and voice pattern).  Edward Arnold does a great job at conveying Barney's immense feelings of guilt at having left the only good thing in his life.<br /><br />In her very brief screen career, Frances Farmer considered COME AND GET IT as her best movie performance.  And her pride is justified.  Without a strong Lotta at it's core, this would be just another forgettable "weepie" from the mid-1930s, but Farmer's performance turns COME AND GET IT into an event.<br /><br />This film only earned two Academy Award nominations ('Best Supporting Actor' for Walter Brennan, and 'Best Film Editing' for Edward Curtiss).  Farmer wasn't even nominated, despite the fact she plays two different characters--and almost two different movies.  As a follow-up to her role here, Farmer was to have played Laurel in "Stella Dallas", but instead turned away from Hollywood to star on Broadway in "Golden Boy".<br /><br />For fans of the tragic, under-appreciated Frances Farmer, COME AND GET IT deserves a special place on the shelf.  The DVD includes the trailer.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).
 | product/productId: 076783917X | review/userId: AGW8KE45YS9ZH | review/summary: Beautifully weaved Masterpiece | review/text: Almodovar's "All About My Mother" is perhaps the most beautifully written and acted film I have ever seen. In typical Almodovar fashion, the film is full of symbolism, vibrant colors, inter-connected story lines, and an ending that brings the entire film full circle without being cliche.<br /><br />After her son dies in a tragic accident in Madrid, Manuela embarks on a personal hegira to Barcelona, where she not only takes a group of misfits under her generous wing, but she finds herself along the way.  Full of masterfully detailed relationships, honesty, and love, the film is genuinely moving.  Not one to leave sorrow or mystery behind, Almodovar blends the mystery of the human condition with a concoction of humor and compassion brilliantly.<br /><br />This is truly a pinnacle in a career full of cinematic highs.

They begged me to get the DVD so they could watch it over and over.<br /><br />I can't attest to the historical accuracy of all the elements, but it's definately realistic and true to the rugged nature of the old west. Characters are not invincible, people die, even 'good' characters have faults and flaws, and *gasp* they have to reload the appropriate amount of times for the type of guns they're using.<br /><br />An excellent story about men and women trying to find their place in the frontier.
 | product/productId: 0767835948 | review/userId: ACYXDY0SUFS7N | review/summary: SOMETHING ELSE | review/text: Limbo is a fascinating movie - no Hollywood stuff, but independent film-making of very high quality. Most of all I like the two main characters played by David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. The way they get to know each other is very tender, very convincing, and also funny at times. I particularly like the scene in the bar when she comes to his table after singing a song, and they start revealing little bits about themselves to each other - that's fascinating acting, and fascinating dialogue too.<br />As for the much-disputed ending - oh well, I don't want to give away too much, but director/writer/editor John Sayles says in his DVD commentary (highly recommended) that it was the only ending that seemed appropriate to him, and maybe he's right...
 | product/productId: 6300183157 | review/userId: A1G1BKRT12DIKB | review/summary: PRE FRENCH CONNECTION | review/text: A couple minutes of nyc street scenes look like THE FRENCH CONNECTION, but this movie is very much about a STRAY DOG stolen gun, and not about heroin.  This movie is also too polite and liberal, when FRENCH CONNECTION was known for its racist language.  And THE FRENCH CONNECTION also had ethnic nyc actors, here swedish meatball Inger Stevens is in the cast.<br /><br />The movie was written by blacklisted very-communist Abraham Polansky, who wrote the John Garfiled movie BODY AND SOUL waay waay back, and it shows with his out-dated dialogue.  Polanksy, to his death, hated Elia Kazan for ratting out Stalin fans in the 1950s.<br /><br /> Andrew Sarris, of THE VILLAGE VOICE, put this in his top ten list of the year it came out---probably only because of Polanksy being blacklisted, since Sarris never put THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE GODFATHER, or DIRTY HARRY in the top ten for the year they came out.
 | product/productId: 6300248100 | review/userId: A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY | review/summary: Over two decades later, still a great film ! | review/text: When this film first came out in 1985, it had only been two years since the Israeli attack on Lebanon in 1982 and the Sabra and Chatilla Massacres there.  So I found myself projecting mid-Eastern politics into the story.  I have no idea if this was the intent of the writer or the producer, but the scenes of the mining camp where Davidge first sees how Humans are mistreating the reptilian race called Dracs -- and understands that Earth is not so righteous in her attempts to colonize an already-inhabited part of space -- really hit home for me at that time.  Having just viewed this film again last night, I can still see the mid-East parallels, as well as a more general story about building intercultural bridges and turning enemies into friends.<br /><br />The film itself is fantastic in terms of acting.  It doesn't have high-tech special effects (the opening scenes are analog and rather dated) but it doesn't really need them.  As other reviewers here have noted, this could easily be performed as a stage play, because its mostly a drama between the two main characters.  The depth and growth of these characters -- and the way the actors have played them -- is still very timely, making this, in my opinion, one of the best of science fiction films of all time.<br /><br />The film opens with space battles between two sworn enemies, Humans and Dracs, who have been at war for a long time but neither really knows much about the other.  Then a soldier from each side crashes on a hostile planet -- where they must now cooperate in order to survive.  Davidge the human and Jerry the Drac (a nickname, since Davidge can't pronounce the full Drac name) eventually learn each other's languages and develop genuine respect.  Davidge, who had never before even seen a Drac,  learns that they have a deep spirituality and a very sophisticated culture.  Hec also learns that the areas of space Earth has been colonizing (and assuming to be empty, unclaimed territory) have actually been part of the Drac empire for centuries.  So the Dracs see Earth as the invaders -- a perspective Davidge had not considered before.<br /><br />Dracs are hermaphroditic, and Jerry becomes pregnant, explaining that "with Humans it is a choice, but with Dracs it just happens."  Jerry is looking forward to having a child, but the birth goes wrong and Jerry dies in childbirth.  Now it's up to Davidge to raise a Drac child -- which he does, forming a genuine bond of love with this little alien being.  So when the Drac child is captured and enslaved by the Human miners - -well, any more would be a spoiler.  Watch it for yourself.

Most would complain and recommend that you go read  &quot;Animal Farm.&quot; I feel &quot;Antz&quot; does just as good a job of  displaying the corrupt forces using sinful tactics to gain power. Then, the  society is saved by the masses led by an unconscious revisionist. That  revisionist is Z. Our hero spends the entire movie looking for his utopia,  and in the end, he finally finds it in his colony with his lover. The evil  powers at play are the soldiers led by the sturdy, strict General Mandible.  His way of gaining power is slaughtering the ants that resist him and  marrying the queen's daughter. The story is simple. However, it allows us  to look into it and make out comparisons to past revolutions. If you don't  enjoy this, the movie is also quite entertaining. Filled with good one  liners and humorous situations, &quot;Antz&quot; is also a crowd pleaser.  The voice acting is great. &quot;Antz&quot; manages to cast perfectly with  some famous names that will surely surprise you. However, it loses points  because of its content. If I had a kid and took them to see this movie, I  would have been very angry. There is way too much in this film that just  crosses the line of what I would consider PG. This is not for children of  protective parents. Overall, &quot;Antz&quot; is a guaranteed winner. I  secretly hoped it would achieve some Oscar success.
 | product/productId: 0790736926 | review/userId: A26ADZO10P670A | review/summary: See this review for the movies by Wayne you ought to see. | review/text: Basically a popcorn film and a waste of Wayne's talents. Starts out good but devolves into a trite plot of revenge to make one a man. It's been done to death. If you want to see 5 star Wayne, watch THE SEARCHERS, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, RED RIVER, THE SHOOTIST, and STAGECOACH. All are Wayne at his best and more Oscar worthy than his admittedly fine performance in TRUE GRIT. I am a fan of The Duke, who was vastly underrated as an actor, and made many fine films beside the ones I mentioned.

It was untill only a couple of days ago that I actally did. Audrey Hepburn was one of the most beautiful actresses I ever seen. Her style, and the way she carried herself all together is probally what every girl want to be like. She was a very talanted actress, and a beautiful woman. When I saw this movie, I really enjoyed every moment. Not only does Audrey Hepburn give a great performance, but George Peppard gives a good performance also. I was very caught up in the movie! I personally enjoyed the beginning, because I think it's what many people do, especially women (including me ). When you see it you'll know what I am talking about, and if you saw it then you already know. I definately recomend this movie to everyone, especially those who love romantic movies.

That's not to say Ronin's a bad film, in fact it's pretty good, but in retrospect it marked the beginning of a long slide for DeNiro that has yet to end.  While churning out money-makers at a record pace he has yet to return to form and hasn't given a truly phenomenal performance since Cape Fear.  This time he stars as an ex-CIA operative whose left out in the cold after the Cold War has ended.  This leads to more than a few car chases and coming from the director of The French Connection, they don't disappoint.  Natasha McElphone turns in another steller performance coming off of two of my favorite movies - The Truman Show and The Devil's Own.  The locations are some of the best in film for a long time, reminsant of the days when that actually meant something.  Buckle in because this is one wild ride and while not much else you're sure to be satisfied with the results.

 | product/productId: 6300987558 | review/userId: A2TWC1GONICTN3 | review/summary: Entertaining Nostalgia! | review/text: I had seen this movie for the first time many years ago on television actually, well after it's release. Before then, I had never even heard of it. What a pleasant, humorous surprise it was. Anyone who had attended High School in the 80's or even 70's (or want a little humorous taste of those that did) will surely enjoy this one. I have watched many of the 70's/80's type movies, and enjoyed most of them, but this one has always been my favorite. As some other reviewers have mentioned, there are always bullies in schools, and this picture takes that "fear" that many of us had, and exploits it for fun and enjoyment. When the main character mistakenly, and innocently touches Buddy Revel, he sets into motion his seemingly inevitable demise at school dismissal...3 O'clock. We can all feel his fear and desperation as he tries everything and anything to avoid the "showdown" at 3 O'clock High. Watching one plan after another fail miserably as the clock keeps ticking, is just a riot! I was recently talking about the movie with my brother, and discussing how we hadn't seen it in such a long time, and wondered if it were even available. Well, after a quick search, here I found it on Amazon, and how thrilled I was to once again enjoy this unheralded gem. IMO, the humor and story are like the old Honeymooners...timeless, and enjoyable by all! Definitely get it!

 | product/productId: 0780627083 | review/userId: A1SVXJZ3386U2D | review/summary: Innovative | review/text: "Mask" starts out simple enough as it should.  We see the mundane, boring life of a well-meaning yet socially challenged young junior bank employee.  His meager apartment, his nosy, irritating landlord, his nepotistic boss at work, his poor taste in clothes, etc.  His two consolations are his swinging buddy at work and his idealistic belief that there's somebody out there waiting for him.  Into this well-set stage comes a mask that our hero, Stanley Ipkiss, stumbles upon and holds up to his face.  Presto!  He suddenly changes into a devil-may-care, life of the party, green-skinned lover.  Off he goes to really enjoy life.<br /><br />The highlights of "Mask" are those scenes in which Ipkiss is transformed into this character.  We see the combined efforts of music, makeup, special effects, and the acting of Jim Carey that create a world of fun, humor and excitement.  Carey hams it up and we love it.  Along the way, an actual plot is woven into the picture.  It's a good enough plot but we want to see Ipkiss put on the mask again to see what new craziness we'll get.<br /><br />In the end, the mask has served its' purpose and Stanley Ipkiss is not a new man; he is the same person but no longer shy about who he is.  The doors have opened and his new life is beginning.  After the excitement of "Mask" wears off, after we've seen it a few more times, we realize that the meaning is that we are all repressed somewhat by our intimidation from our surroundings.  If we could just slip into some sort of costume or alias and be who we really want to be, life would be fulfilled.  The movie reminds us that, if this were possible, there would be a lot great stories but a lot of bad stories as well.  Good expands to better while bad expands to worse.  It's who we are in the first place that determines where the mask will let us go to.  Ultimately, we discover, we don't have to be the life of the party; we just need to accept the invitation and attend it.
 | product/productId: 630026937X | review/userId: A2HW4GC6H0L2LR | review/summary: Intriguing but Hollow... | review/text: As an Agatha Christie fan, I was very curious when I happened upon this video recently.  As Christie always seems so cool, collected and in control as the voice behind her mysteries, I assumed that that was how she was in real life.  Thus as I read the video description and learned that she was a painfully shy woman who clung to her husband for support, I was very interested in learning more.<p>What made this film even more intriguing is that in writing a screenplay about Christie, the minds behind this film did so playfully.  They focused on an 11 day period when Christie disappeared, and set the whole thing up as a mystery plot...in classic Agatha style...<p>Or so they thought.  The mystery part of this movie left no real mystery to solve.  The &quot;surprise twist&quot; at the end was a minor twist that didn't really fulfill expectations.  Otherwise, everything was painstakingly clear.<p>If you can leave aside the whole mystery story as a bold but ultimately doomed attempt (doomed simply by the confines of reality), the rest of the story did hold its own.  The plot moved slowly, dialog was sometimes hard to understand and minor characters were hard to keep track of...all of which are typical of older films.  However, the characters were engaging and the plot kept things moving along.<p>The build-up of the relationship between Christie and Apted is fully believable, except they don't get together in the end.  This is not a &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; situation where they can't because of circumstances.  Rather, it is because Apted is fictional and therefore not true to Christie's real life story.  Thus, you are left emotionally baffled.<p>All that said, the greatest value I personally received from the film was a MUCH BETTER understanding of Christie herself and also of England in the 1920's.  Additionally, I enjoyed Hoffman's character thoroughly.  He really shone in his role.

 | product/productId: 6301899962 | review/userId: ADNA24AADKBQ9 | review/summary: Absorbing overall | review/text: This is a well-paced and absorbing movie based on the novel by Gerald Seymour. Ross Kemp, best known in the US for playing Grant Mitchell in British series "EastEnders", puts in a worthy performance as agricultural equipment salesman Gavin Hughes, who is pressed by the British government into spying on his contacts in Iran in exchange for keeping out of prison. His information leads to the deaths of 24 Iranian weapons scientists, and for his own safety he is forced to abandon his family and change his identity. Years later, as he enjoys an idyllic new life as 'Frank Perry' on the Suffolk coast with new love Meryl (Saskia Reeves) and her young son, his cover is blown and an Iranian assassin tracks him down. This time Gavin/Frank refuses to run, and as the authorities scramble to protect him, the hitman closes in.<p>I don't really understand the R rating as the violence is pretty minimal. I withheld a star only because the ending had a few disappointing aspects, but the cast is great, the pacing is good and the movie sustains itself without resorting to over-the-top gimmicks.

If you like your swords and sorcery bloody and action packed, then this is the movie  for you.  There are a few laughs, but for the most part this movie is  pretty serious.  It's not very faithful to any of the original stories (it  combines elements of several, kind of like watching one of The Brady Bunch  movies), but it does do a very good job of capturing the feeling of the  books.
 | product/productId: 0780623819 | review/userId: A2RBE2EXK10ZTA | review/summary: this is a great movie | review/text: Thier are alot of fans of the original series that complain  about this movie.Wake up and check the date!First off it was a good thing that the movie was made the way it was in the series,I don't think a "Brady Bunch" feel was the way to go here.The series was made in a different time for a different audience, but that doesn't mean the movie is bad.This movie was made with very realistic charactors that made a very realistic family with realistic problems. Despite the lack of the "Brady Bunch" factor, the charactors did pull together and work together just like in the series.<br /><br />Another plus is that with todays techology, the makers of this movie made a more realistic looking movie than the makers of the tv series could evan hope to dream for.So forget the complaints of those old fogies who were disappointed because they wanted to "relive thier youth" through this movie, Lodt in Space of one great Scifi/Action-Adventure movie.

 | product/productId: 078322687X | review/userId: A1IANEBSMVGHS9 | review/summary: Now I know why this is a classic | review/text: I guess I was locked out in a cave, because in spite of having graduated from high school in 1989, today I saw "The Breakfast Club" for the first time. Laugh if you may, but I guess this opinion from an eighties child who is now 33 years old may help you decide to watch it too.<br /><br />The movie is now over twenty years old, and it doesn't feel old. The first half hour or so, you may feel like you're watching a teenage movie, but the plot thickens a bit as it evolves and the definite personalities of the five characters float to the surface, baring their souls to each other and the viewer. You will find yourself finding one (or more) of them with whom you will be able to identify with. In my case it was Brian (the nerd), but you may find you had more in common with the ones depicting the athlete, the basket case, the princess or the criminal.<br /><br />The performances are all extraordinary, but the true standouts were Emilio Estevez (the athlete) and Judd Nelson (the criminal), who were perfect for their roles and delivered some of the best lines overall. Now I know why this is a classic.
 | product/productId: 0790737345 | review/userId: ACBCN4JC3XR24 | review/summary: The pain was excruciating!!!! | review/text: This is the most horrible remake I have ever found.  I assumed the English version could be close to the German version of Wings of Desire and was completely wrong.  This movie is the worst waste of film I have ever found!  The whole trench coat angel thing that was so critical to Wings of Desire made no sense in sunny hot Los Angeles.  The characters were massacred to fit into Los Angeles but none of the obvious things that would not fit in Los Angeles were touched.  This movie is way too much Hollywood with over exaggerated romance and of course death at the end.  I nearly died too.  It was sappy as Hell and even as a girl, too much for me.  It was too typical Hollywood with exaggerated romance, a stupid sex scene and death.  Wim Wenders is not Hollywood and thank God for it.  The cast of Wings of Desire took so much care with every element of the film.  The City of Angels cast just shot out their lines in a brainless manner without though of the big picture.  Maybe a complete redo of the whole Wings of Desire concept could have saved this movie.  Changing some parts and keeping others made for a horrible boring and annoying combination.  One star is being generous!
 | product/productId: 0792846834 | review/userId: A2UUWETDYA2EKV | review/summary: Beats "Last Year at Marienbad" | review/text: The reviews for this movie are more interesting and categorical than most. Viewers either love the film or hate it. Like any good work of art, STP tries to get us to see the familiar in an unfamiliar way, such that our understanding of the every-day is deepened. So I'm tempted to say that anyone willing to look through Jarmusch's novel spectacles will be rewarded, while those insisting on a more conventional approach will turn away in disgust. But perhaps the results are not as simple as that. After all, who would want to sit through a double feature that extends the listlessness and minimalism to 3 hour duration. STP may have moments of real insight such as the dead-end diner, nevertheless as cinematic style, the limitations are obvious. (Andy Warhol's eight hours of fixed focus on a Manhattan skyscraper may be a profound idea, but as repeatable cinema the limitations are even more obvious.) Still and all, this one-of-a kind is salvaged by its droll humor. By any measure, it's an exquisite example of existential comedy. The zombified characters simply cannot communicate with one another and as a result are reduced to co-existing in darkly humorous fashion, carrying their mute fumblings from one seedy locale to another, (the ridiculous pork-pie hats are a brilliant comedic touch). And not even that most American of solutions, a big wad of money, helps; in fact the sudden windfall produces a final physical separation, both amusingly ironic and unexpectedly poignant. Apparently, Jarmusch intends this on-going isolation as a musing on the so-called human condition, since a number of scenes are filmed against featureless horizons. But whatever the over-all intention, this `Buster Keaton meets Ingmar Bergman' oddity remains a classic of deadpan understatement. And though most of us are a lot more talkative than the three principals, I wonder--when you get right down to it which Jarmusch does--if we communicate any more effectively.

This movie, like Halloween, is definately a classic and was one of it's kind when it came out back in 1980. Just incase there are some of you out there who haven't seen this movie I won't spoil the ending so I'll just say that Friday the 13th stands out from the other sequels based on the killer . I am not a big fan of the series but as far as the sequels go, the only ones I recommend are Friday the 13th part 2,3,4,6,8,and Jason X. My reviews on the sequels will tell you why I liked some and not others.

Lucas Haas in his premier role as the witness is amazing.<br /><br />One of the most well-worth it scenes is the barn raising.

 | product/productId: 630159942X | review/userId: AB5DVSNPX1JSK | review/summary: Pride of the 40's | review/text: Arguably the greatest sports biography ever filmed, the movie that encompasses the life of Lou Gehrig is remarkable.  Nominated for best picture and actor in 1943, the film is an inspirational and emotionally charged story about one man in both life and sport that was and is loved even to this day.  Lou Gehrig (G. Cooper) is portrayed as an honest, simple and selfless man who simply wants to play the game of baseball.  Although he means well, Gehrig is depicted as being both clumsy and reckless in his pursuit of the game.  The film begins with Gehrig as a young, poor immigrant boy who yearns to play ball but is pressured by his mother to become an engineer in college.  Being a mama's boy, Gehrig does what his mother wants and heads for college to become successful and rich.  When his mother grows ill, Gehrig finds himself in desperate need for money.  While playing ball on the side in college, a scout for the New York Yankees (W. Brennan) spots him and wants him to sign a contract.  Needing the money Gehrig accepts and the rest is Major League Baseball history.<br /><br /> The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't entirely focus on Gehrig's success on the diamond, but his success as a man.  We learn of Gehrig's internal struggles with his mother, his subtle rivalry with teamate Babe Ruth (who portrays himself in this film), and his loving relationship with his wife (T. Wright) which gives a full biography of his greatness.<br /><br /> As the film moves on from Gehrig's early years as a Yankee to a superstar and "The Iron Horse" of Baseball, the climax is revealed as an unfortunate turn for the worse.  The tragedy over Lou Gehrig's life is what detours this film from a giddy feel good bio of a great athlete and man to a movie about physical decline and death, while facing all these inevitable fates with dignity and honor.  The movie is humbling, to say the least, and powerful with hope.  It's difficult not to get choked up as the final scene fades away.<br /><br /> Like all good sports films, the success of it isn't in the sport itself or the record setting highlights of a memorable career.  The success is in the human development of the real life character(s) and their real life struggles.  As imagined, this isn't a story about home runs or Lou Gehrig winning the World Series.  It's about Lou Gehrig---the man.<br /><br /> One cannot say enough for the realism Gary Cooper poured into the character of Lou Gehrig.  After seeing real footage of Gehrig the likeness between both the athlete and actor are eerie in its similarity.  Gary Cooper won the oscar the year before for his role as Sgt. Alvin York and ten years later as Will Kane in "High Noon," but in the humble opinion of this reviewer this was his finest performance of his entire career.<br /><br /> There is no warnings to speak of with this movie.  In 1943 there were no such things as rating systems because movies didn't have to be rated.  The only thing to keep in mind is that the movie does end in a form of tragedy, which may come across as depressing to certain audiences.<br /><br /> In summary, "Pride of the Yankees" is one of the best films of the 1940s and is easily among the greatest sports films ever done.  It is important to note that it is also a rareity for Hollywood to focus a story on a clean and uncontroversial athlete, such as Gehrig, whereas in recent sports biographies over Muhammed Ali and Babe Ruth have nothing but controversy painted all over them. It can be said that hope can sell over controversy.

All he wants is opportunity, which for him means washing dishes or dealing drugs (corporate America's not hiring). He rises through the underworld through guts and determination and achieves what he set out to achieve; money, power and the woman.<br /><br /> His success is bittersweet as he is keenly aware. He is also aware of the hippocricy of the society of which he is now a part. You can point your finger at Tony and call him the "Bad Guy". Does that make you good?<br /><br />he sticks to his own integrity as his world unravels around him, never bending his own rules to save his skin. How many of society's moralists and finger pointers can make that claim? Brilliantly acted by Pacino and with a great supporting cast. Written by Oliver Stone who did research in the field in South America and directed by Brian De Palma. This is a must see.

 | product/productId: 0767843258 | review/userId: A3OUNPPWYVAWIH | review/summary: No gene for the human spirit (or apparently not for emotion) | review/text: Wolverine from the X-men. The Fonz from Happy Days. Han Solo from Star Wars. Spock from Star Trek. Ayukawa Madoka from Kimagure orenji rdo. Even Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. These characters all have several things in common. 1) They are all very Cool, 2) All were supporting characters (as opposed to the stars) of their particular story, 3) All were the only Cool characters in their story.<p>Number three is the thing that really made them work. It is a proven fact that people like &quot;the cool character&quot; and so many times a writer of a book or a movie or a television show or even professional wrestling tries to make all the characters &quot;cool.&quot; But when every character is a cold, stoic, cigarette smoking SOB with a killer instinct, the effect is diminished. This is the major problem with the movie Gattaca.<p>One could theorize that Writer/Director Andrew Niccol was trying to make a statement about the loss of humanity that occurs in a world built on gene-gineered perfection. But if this is the case, then the metaphor never really materializes. Instead we have a film where all the characters are so cool... so intense... that it is hard to actually identify with any of them. Again, it could be argued that this is intentional, but somehow, I feel as though my inability to truly identify with Ethan Hawke's Vincent character removes something from my enjoyment of the film.<p>That said, I must admit that I did enjoy Gattaca. For starters, the film is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept behind the film is very ambitious and Niccol exploration of the idea is very concise and complete. The ideas generated by the questions this movie asks can provide the viewer with philosophical musings for the rest of the evening.<p>The lead actors, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (not to mention supporting actors Jude Law and Loren Dean) provide no shortage of eye-candy for male of female viewers. One cannot find a fault in Hawke's acting in this film (or Thurman's to be fair) so much as with the characters they were portraying. <p>The tragedy of this film is that there could have been a beautiful love story here. But the characters are so cold that it is hard to see why Irene (Thurman) and Vincent (Hawke) would fall for each other at all. The only truly attractive quality either displays is unbelievable drive.<p>Despite its faults, this film is still somewhat recommended. The cinematography is excellent and the ideas presented are so insightful that I can look past the faults of the movie enough to give it 3 stars.

After seeing this epic of a documentary of the making of Apocalypse Now then go out and buy the "second" Apocalypse Now with "Redux" at the end. Francis Ford Coppola clearly states why he made the original the way it is and in particular why he took out the (slow and confusing) French Plantation scene. There is a lot of the French Plantation scene shown in Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker's Apocalypse so Redux is really not the first time the scene is shown although you don't see the entire scene in the documentary you aren't missing anything hence the reason Coppola took it out! The addition helicopter/Playboy scene is useless and they didn't even film the entire script of that segment due to the pouring rain.<br /><br />I just want to message that IMO "Redux" is a rip off. The rabid fans (like me) of Apocalypse Now must see it and own it but know it for what it is... another way to get at your money for little substance in return.<br /><br />The original version RULES!  :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rick<br />Austin, TX<br />PS: Charlie Don't Surf !!!!!!!
 | product/productId: 6300213803 | review/userId: A3MU9G6YWKTGTA | review/summary: Undeniably the pinnacle of Star Trek films | review/text: Star Trek has had its high points and its low points over the years.  There have been some tremendous storys told, and some...  lackluster?...  ones, and some just terrible ones.<br /><br />Note that I grew up with the original series.  Yes, there have been additional spin-off type series, supposedly set in the same universe, and they can be treated individually, but as far as I'm concerned, "Star Trek" is the original TV series and the movies based upon that, not "The Next Generation" or "Voyager" or "Deep Space Nine" or "Enterprise" or the new "reboot movie" done by JJ Abrams a couple of years ago.  Those are all largely separate enntities, all of which (yes, including the new flick) have different characters, different situations, different storytelling techhniques, and so forth.  This doesn't NECESSARIlY make those other spin-off ideas worse, or better, just different.  You can make your own calls about the quality of each individual spin-off.  In other words, I'm just defining my terms here.<br /><br />That said, we can easily put the severan TNG-era movies into the comparison, as this movie far eclipses those as well.<br /><br />In 1979, "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" came out.  It was the big-screen continuation of the original Star Trek TV show, supposedly "updated."  The quality of the visual effects was spectacular, and the new ship (it's not the same ship, it just happens to have the same name and the same general configuration) was pretty to look at.  The same actors were playing the same roles.<br /><br />But... the FEEL was all wrong.  It lacked the real, HUMAN, interactions which were at the core of the original series' best storytelling.  So we had a ship which felt dreary, depressing, and dehumanizing inside.  We had costuming which might have been comfortable, but was visually dull and drab.  We had dialog which occasionally "hinted" at the close "just like us" human interaction which the original series was so successful for using, but mostly, it was actors staring at pretty lights with badly-acted "awestruck looks" on their faces.<br /><br />SO...  despite being a technical masterpiece (for the most part), this first movie was not considered the sort of blockbuster which would have been required to make additional movies.<br /><br />Fortunately, someone at Paramount realized that it wasn't the fault of the cast, or of the overall concept, but rather of the leadership for the production, which led to the storytelling failures of this film.  And they realized that they had a lot of property, built for that first film, which would be able to be re-used at very little cost for additional films.<br /><br />SO...  they dumped the production team (including Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, who at this point had lost track of what he'd originally known so well when creating the original series!) and hired an entirely new production team.  A team who had no attachments to Star Trek whatsoever.<br /><br />They hired a well-known TV line-producer, Harve Bennett, as the executive producer (taking over from ROddenberry).  Bennett was someone who understood budgeting, scheduling, and the proper way to "hire the right people and then get out of their way," all areas in which Roddenberry had failed, very badly, in while making TMP.  Bennett held sway over the majority of the remaining original-series films, with just a couple of exceptions, and much of the success of the films he led can be laid directly at his feet.<br /><br />They hired a really good director, who understood what the director of "The Motion Picture" had failed to grasp... science fiction is just set-dressing, and the storytelling must be about PEOPLE, not about "fantastic special effects" or "high-concepts" even if you're wrapped up in those things.  All the "science fiction" trappings of the story are there for is to open up possible HUMAN storytelling which might not be practical in "real world" situations.  Nicholas Meyer got that, and got it very, very well.  He, frankly, didn't care at all about the "space" elements of this, but he clearly understood the CHARACTERS.<br /><br />The budget was reduced, dramatically, from what was available in the first film.  Nevertheless, they had enough budget to create a new ship (the Reliant, a sister ship to the Enterprise) to make new uniforms (which seemed more real, and were much more visually appealing, patterned in large part upon real-world military uniforms).  They re-used quite a bit from the first movie (the two of the new sets... the space station transporter room and the Enterprise torpedo bay...  were both repaints of portions of a set... the Klingon bridge... from the first movie, for example), they raided "stock prop" warehouses for set-dressing (the same "scifi set dressing" bits seen in this film were seen in dozens and dozens of other 1970s, 1980s and 1990s TV shows), and so forth.  Heck, they made new "communicators" from found equipment from the local Home Depot!<br /><br />They did hire Lucas's special effects house, "Industrial Light and Magic," to do the visual effects, and they did a fine job,  Again, to save money, they re-used some shots from the first film, so while the model of the Enterprise did get a new paint job or this film, it still has the original paint job in quite a few shots.<br /><br />My point is simple...  they were FRUGAL in this film.  Instead of planning out science-fictiony spectacle, as the first movie did, they focused almost entirely on the human storytelling.  The other stuff was, as it should be, all "set dressing" to help the audience forget that they're watching actors on a soundstage.  And it worked...  magnificently.  (A lesson which J.J. Abrams seems to have failed on, in my judgement, in his reboot movie.)<br /><br />The storytelling in this film is what makes it rise head and shoulders above any other Star Trek film, and over most non-Star Trek films for that matter.  We get characters who we can imagine actually knowing, and liking, in real life (something we had in the best examples of the original series as well, but lacked, entirely, in the first movie).  We got drama from situations which, while wrapped in science-fiction trappings, were really about the most fundamental human emotions...  a villain who has (understandable, if irrational) rage issues directed against the hero, and a hero who feels that his life is "winding down" and sees all the lost opportunities and mistakes behind him.<br /><br />It's a trope that "Captain Kirk slept with every girl he met" in the original series (it's not really true, by the way, but it's a trope nevertheless).  This movie showed the "leading man romantic" role he often filled in a very different light, by introducing the great love of his life, the "little blonde lab tech" he was mentioned as having "almost married" in the very first appearance of Kirk in the original series, and it turns out that he also has a son...  a son who doesn't know that Kirk is his father.  It actually explains quite a bit, and shows that there are consequences we all have to deal with for our choices.  And, thankfully, this turns out OK in the end (at least in this film!)<br /><br />The dialog is written so well, even with somewhat different visuals, there's no question but that these are the same characters we know and love from the original series.  It's dramatic, when appropriate, funny (in a realistic way, not a slapstick way) when appropriate, and just COMFORTABLE all the rest of the time.  No stilted "science-fictiony" dialog, just normal people having normal conversations about imporant things in their lives.<br /><br />The acting also reflects the pinnacle of the Star Trek films, and is a key element to the above.  Nick Meyer did a terrific turn as director, and as a result even some of the more lackluster actors turn in terrific performances.  I'm not a huge George Takei fan overall ("Sulu"), and I never really liked the Chekov character (though I grew to love Walter Koenig, the actor who played him, through watching Babylon 5) but this film shows both of these guys at their best.  Nichele Nichols, as Uhura, does a good job, but she's probably the most underutilized original-series actor in this film (a sad but necessary requirement of reasonable storytelling (the comms officer is seldom going to be a major player in real-life events, and in this film, the storytelling tool priority over "giving everyone their moment"...  something later films ended up trying, way too hard at times, to do)  James Doohan's turn as Scotty in this film was also "lightly written" but had some really good moments.  But, as with the original series, this movie was built around the "big three trio," Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.<br /><br />One of the things that made the original series work so well was that the big-three characters sort of grew into psychological archetypes...  Kirk as the "superego" (The psychology term for the part which makes decisions, based upon the input of the other two elements), the "ego" (the logical, rational side of our mind), through Spock, and the ID (the emotional, feelings-based side of our minds) which obviously was McCoy.  This is very clearly played out in a sequence in this film, set in Kirk's cabin, where they discuss the concept of "Genesis" in this film.<br /><br />Finally, this film did something I LOVED.  It took risks, and make "permanent" changes to the status-quo, in universe.  (I put "permanent" in quotes because, unfortunately, some of these "permanent" changes got reversed later...  so the brave choices made in this film largely got erased in later films, putting us back into the "status quo," which was just a horrible mistake as far as I'm concerned!)<br /><br />The best films, but best TV shows, the best storytelling in general, must involve REAL GROWTH AND CHANGE.  This is part of why Babylon 5 remains my all-time favorite TV series...  and why, from a pure storytelling perspective, Deep Space Nine may in fact be the best drama told in the Star Trek universe.  You have to have real jeaopardy, real risk.  Characters... BELOVED characters...  need to be at real risk, and occasionally may need to die... and STAY THAT WAY.<br /><br />Otherwise, none of the storytelling ends up having any real impact.<br /><br />This film made real changes.  It introduced two three major new characters, all of whom should have become part of the "recurring cast" for future films (but one of whom was never seen again, one of whom was later removed entirely, and one of whom was badly recast... no offense to the replacement, but this character ceased to be the same character!)<br /><br />The situation at the end of the film isn't the same as we saw during the original TV series, or at the beginning of the film.  Characters have changed, new relationships are being formed...  and new character dynamics would likely be present in future films.  It was...  perfect.  It just works.  Beautifully.<br /><br />Later Star Trek movies were still fairly good, to varying degrees, but they lost sight of the "story first, above all" on occasion...  needing to give every actor their "moment" in each film (even if it doesn't really serve the storytelling), or drawing back from taking big risks, or (worst of all) REVERSING the "changes" which this film gave us, instead putting us back into the "same thing, with no changes, but with older actors" situation.<br /><br />The last "Original series" film was also the second best...  "The Undiscovered Country."  It's no shock that this film was also helmed by Nick Meyer, and while a bit lesser than this film, it's a fine film as well.  And it also deals with real change, albeit in different ways.<br /><br />If you only watch ONE Star Trek film, this is the one to watch.

It has wonderful casts that include James Spader, Kyra Sedwick, Helen Mirren and Albert Brooks.<p>The movie started out like a cheap hospital comedy but along way the way it got serious with issues like health care, insurance, lawsuit and whether it is ethical to let go a patient that has no chance of survival. It is funny and heart warming as well. Given the price of the DVD, it is a must buy. The DVD provided both WS and FS versions of the movie but not much of extra features but for the price, you can't complaint.

 | product/productId: 0783242808 | review/userId: A37DLVPKJZGSQF | review/summary: Extremely good movie, disappointing unrated edition. | review/text: I like this film a lot and I don't care who knows it. It is funny, romantic, dramatic, truthful, funny and did I mention it's really, really funny. However, I was disappointed by the Un-rated version. It didn't have much changed from the old movie, maybe a little bit more explicit, but please! They could've at least made it sound as good as the cover promised. Don't worry too much though, it improves on the first movie's sexual details, and you'll still find the film as enjoyable and as rewatchable. The star-studded cast all do fantastically, bringing their sexually desperate feelings blazingly alive. Most are newcomers who have had small roles - Tara Reid in Urban Legend or Chris Owen in October Sky - but they are all promising roles as good as this one in the near future. The script is repeatedly clever with it's hilarity and although drink will be coming out your nose, for the most light-hearted people, tears may be coming out of your eyes. All in all, this is a - I'll repeat it again just so you understand fully - REALLY funny film that won't appeal to everyone, but for all viewers who are looking for some raunchy fun, don't miss American Pie! It is well worth the money and the time.

Julie Andrews sang a little song about "pouring out" when this first came out, but Disney cut most of the running tea gags on re-release -- so the whole teapot etiquette scene on Uncle Albert's ceiling is missing.  Maybe Juan Valdez slipped Mickey a little something under the table?<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke's ersatz cockney accent seems to have aged severely over the decades, although Uncle Albert is now clearly bipolar.  Four stars.  If Eisnerville ever re-releases the original, with the tea jokes intact, it might be a five again.

Extras will include the Going Back to Xanadu featurette and the film's theatrical trailer, along with the complete soundtrack on CD. It would be nice if it had two DVD commentaries, one featuring the Director, ONJ and Michael Beck and the second featuring comments from Jeff Farrar and Jeff Lynne. One hopes the complete soundtrack CD also includes Fool Country, Drum Dreams and the instrumental opening score.<br />However, if you must have a copy RIGHT NOW of this great campy flick featuring great tunes by Electric Light Orchestra, and Olivia Newton-John (duetting with ELO, Cliff Richard, The Tubes and Gene Kelly ... take that Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett!), you can't go wrong with this currently available edition of this nicely priced DVD, which features the original trailer and actors and production credits.

 | product/productId: 0783222912 | review/userId: A2FNW654OSB917 | review/summary: Way too extreme for a comedy | review/text: I am a HUGE Jim Carrey fan, so naturally I was expecting a great movie. When I popped this movie into the VCR and actually saw it, it was alright for a few minutes. Who can't like the 'I've Had better' part?  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be...a comedy or a  family film? So the rest of the film is just a long running gag with Jim's  off-the-wall shenanigans.  Jim Carrey is way too cartoonish to be  considered heartwarming. The film might have worked if Jim's character  showed a little emotion, but he's too much of a jerk to really root for. If  you are looking for a funny, charming comedy that you can let your kids  watch, get Mrs. Doubtfire...and if you're a Carrey fan, stick with Ace  Ventura.

 | product/productId: 0783112572 | review/userId: A1X1CEGHTHMBL1 | review/summary: A different kind of flying vampire! | review/text: Richard Dees (Miguel Ferrer) is a hard-nosed reporter who covers the strange types of stories.  He covers UFO abductions, serial killers, and ghastly murders and some stories are even more off the wall.  He has a great fan club of loyal readers who believe every word he writes.  There is a new story circulating of a murderer who kills people almost every night in different cities and Dees passes on taking the story so it is assigned to a new junior reporter and she feels this might be her break.  When another murder victim turns up Dees realizes that he passed on a good story and demands to dig into the case and find out who the murderer is.  Dees who is a pilot realizes that the murders occur in cities with local airports and many of the murders are near or at the airport.  He is now in the chase against the junior reporter to solve the case and get the story first.<br /><br />Dees begins following the murders airport to airport in his Cessna and soon catches up with the killer who is also flying from site to site in a Cessna. He soon realizes that he has bitten off more than he expected and he is now in real trouble.....<br /><br />This movie is based on a short story written by Stephen King.  And the story is a good one from the master of horror.  The story line in the movie is slightly different but still a good one and the movie isn't bad.  I enjoyed this movie and it is one of the DVD's in my Stephen King movie collection.  If you get a chance to see it or buy it is worth seeing.  If you are a Stephen King follower you will enjoy it as much as I do.  I recommend this movie to you.
 | product/productId: 1558808809 | review/userId: A23V875B0Q9HT7 | review/summary: Bothersome Details | review/text: I used to love this movie, I saw it countless times when I was a child and then in adolescense and to me it was perfect. That is until I learned some history and then this movie started to show some faults:<br /><br />First the characters: Crassus was portrayed as a handsome, cultured, athletic and cruel Roman general.  In truthness he was a banker and money lender  far from an educated and cultured aristocrat, he was more a pudgy fat misser with an interest in politics for economic gain reasons and he demostrated talent as an organizer and raised legions with his own money but was far from being a heroic master tactitian as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Second:  who is Graccus ? I tried to find him in Roman history books, this is not Gaius or Tiberius Graccus as they were dead by the time of the Spartacus revolt.  The leaders of the Senate at the time after Sulla's demise when this story takes place were Crassus as pointed, Pompey The Great as a great rival of Crassus, Aemilus Scaurus, Metellus Pius and others but there is no mention of a Graccus as a prominent member of the Senate.  Crassus was never dictator, the tittle was not given to him, there were two Consuls as leaders of the Republic, Crassus was one of them and never led Rome alone.<br /><br />The big battle, I thought before it was very well portrayed with hundreds of soldiers participating and a great approach to the battle field by the Roman Legions, and then it becomes messy.  The romans charge the huge slave army that is occupying a commanding position in hills surrounding a valley with a thin 4 rank line, they approach at a walk, move the shields forward and then run away seeing the flaming logs launched by the slave army against them, they never attempt to throw the pilum javelin or do anything useful.  What a waist of energy.  Then the slaves charge abandoning a perfectly good defensive position to collide haphazardly in the valley against the mass of the roman army.  The romans soon lose cohesense and fight as individuals with swords, never do any coordinated attack or defense, never throw their javelins (why do they bother to bring them to the battlefield as they only resort to their swords as armament), the roman army was mighty because it fought as a unit not as individuals as portrayed in the movie.  Then Spartacus charges with his cavalry into the mele&eacute; instead of doing something clever as trying to outflank the Romans or attack their rear or something better, demostrating that he was not a military genius as in fact he is claimed to be, and lastly Pompey charges blindly into the mele&eacute; adding only to the confusion and maybe even endangering Crassus army.  In fact examining the battle it becomes a ridiculous scene.<br /><br />From history I recalled that Pompey never in fact participated in the battle portrayed in the movie and that in fact his army defeated a renegade band of gauls that detached from Spartacus main army but never confronted Spartacus personally.  Later Pompey claimed victory for this separate action and detraced from Crassus' more merited glory.<br /><br />Julius Caesar was in fact friend of Crassus but it is very unlikely he participated in the Spartacus revolt in any capacity as he was away at the time as military governor of part of Spain.<br /><br />These and many other quirks had turned me against this movie and I still ask myself when is Hollywood going to get it right, stick to the historical facts and present a descent portrayal of the Roman battle form.

 | product/productId: 0792139771 | review/userId: A2U8CJU39IAVN4 | review/summary: There are a few I think who missed the point. | review/text: In order to maintain the appearence of objectivity, I was going to rate this movie 4 stars.  But I just couldn't.  It really deserves 5, and it's going to get every one of them.  This movie features some of the most stunning cinematography I've ever seen (scenes of particular brilliance  include the deer-hunting scene and the slo-mo shots right before Gibson's  first rebellion), impeccable acting (I don't know why the British have been  hiding their actors from the American film industry - every one of the  British/Scottish actors in the film was amazing, and Patrick McGoohan (sp)  gave an incredible performance as Longshanks, not to mention newcomer  Sophie Marceau), a magical musical score, and on and on and on and on.  Physical elements alone qualify this work for the title of Best  Picture.<p>Yet, a number of people chastise Gibson and the movie for a  number of reasons, primarily its departure from historical accuracy.  I do  believe these people have missed the point, for I do not believe it is fair  to criticise a movie for failing to realize a goal for which it never  really strived.  I wonder: do these same people criticize Homer's &quot;The  Odyssey&quot;?  Do historical hardbodies cast aspersions at T.H. White's  &quot;Once and Future King&quot; for taking historical liberties with  &quot;King&quot; Arthur? (For that manner, any of the hundreds of  contributions to the Arthurian legend).  What about Robin Hood?  Beowulf?  Romance of the Three Kingdoms?  Why is it copacetic for a book to create a  myth around a cultural hero, but when it comes to film we must be expected  to be as straightlaced about historical fact as an army bootcamp is about  bedmaking and floor cleaning?  <p>I have read a lot of reviews below and a  number of criticisers of the film's historical authenticity spit out the  word &quot;epic&quot; as if it is a word that the American film industry  has abused and transmogrified into a catchphrase for luring in gullible  American movie-goers.  But I argue that Braveheart, and the historical  inaccuracies which it adopts (and it adopts many, which are nicely pointed  out elsewhere), fit the same formula for &quot;Epic Fiction&quot; that we  use to classify great (and I mean, universally accepted as great) epic  works of fiction such as the Iliad, the Odyssey, etc.  These works are not  about who did what where and when and in what fashion.  They are about the  myth, the hero, and the way that they have influenced the ideals of the  culture (italicize that).  Was there really a Grendel, a Cyclops shepherd,  a Wizard named Merlin, or  Chinese war heroes who could single-handedly  take on a small army?  No.  And yet, these works of fiction (and the  mythological heroes that they have created) have had as much if not more of  an impact on their respective cultures than any real life historical event.  The impact of the epic is therefore not to be underestimated.  Does the  fact that Gibson portrayed the battle of Sterling Bridge without a Bridge  really make that much of a differnce?  The end outcome was the same, at  least from an idealogical point of view.  He rallied his men to victory  with brilliant tactics against insurmountable odds.  The presence or  absence of a bridge, naked men, or twenty foot spears does not change that.  The myth survives.<p>Finally, regarding historical accuracy, there is the  fact that although the movie does take a lot of liberties in order to  portray a THEME - I am intelligent enough to suspend my disbelief during  the movie.  Furthermore, after the movie is over, (and this is a credit to  the movie-maker) I was intrigued enough to go do some research on the  subject from an objective historical source to find out what really  happened.  If a work of art (which is not, I remind you, required to be  objective - artistic objectivity is almost an oxymoron and film should not  be treated differently in this regard than any other form of art) instills  in me a desire to learn more about a subject while at the same time  portraying well the epic themes it sets out to portray, then in my book it  was a successful venture and worthy of all the accolades it  receives....Again, this is an epic, and just as a Greek epic might portray  the Trojans as ruthless savages and their own members as heroic  visionaries, I think it is acceptable for a Scottish epic to do the same to  the British.  And calling Gibson a homophobic is just ridiculous.  Whether  or not Edward II was really gay is not important.  If he was, then BY THE  STANDARDS OF THE DAY, he was an outcast, and would have been perceived,  especially by his father, as weak, without potential, and unfit to rule.  If he wasn't gay, but was just disinterested in ruling a kingdom (and  history is filled to the brim with examples of less than sterling royal  progeny), he would have again been seen (especially by his father) as weak,  without potential and unfit to rule (because fathers - especially kings -  have expectations of their sons), and questions about his sexuality would  have naturally begun to arise among the nobility and commonfolk.  What we  as viewers of a historical or epic piece of artwork must do is refrain from  judging said work by our standards.  Today, homosexuality is (for the most  part) accepted by society.  Back then, it wasn't, and the mere rumor was  enough to get you rejected from society (and vice-versa).  Therefore, in  light of the times in which the movie is set, the portrayal of the weak fop  of a prince, EdwardII, as homosexual is both acceptable and indicative of  the society that the movie was trying to portray.  It wouldn't, for  example, have made much sense to portray Edward I as gay.  Not because a  gay man couldn't be a successful King or military leader, but because a gay  man would never have achieved respect as a monarch - THEN - by the people  or his enemy.<p>In closing, this is an excellent film that deserves its  status as a best picture, despite (and perhaps because of) its historical  inaccuracies.  I encourage anyone with any interest in medieval history to  view it, because it might just entice you to look into more historically  accurate documents that, while not as entertaining as the movie iteself,  will give you a more wholistic picture of what really happened.

 | product/productId: 0767811712 | review/userId: A2E6LOTVXW8X2P | review/summary: Implausibility ruined it for me | review/text: I'd heard lots of good things about this movie before I saw it, but I was disappointed because I never believed the romantic chemistry between the two leads.  The whole idea that Helen Hunt's character, a tough-minded single mom and waitress, would fall for Jack Nicholson's vitriolic author thirty years her elder really stretches the bounds of believeability.  Maybe hooking up with a wealthy but pathetic and lonely old man would be in the short-term interest of her sickly son, but there's no other visible reason for her to be interested in him.  The movie tries to give her the motivation of redeeming him when he wows her with &quot;You make me want to be a better man&quot;, but it seems contrived that she would even bother with this jerk who has been bitter and rude to people for longer than she has been alive.<br />I know the age difference is supposed to be secondary to the idea that these are two lost souls who might be able to lean on each other; maybe I would have believed the romance if Helen Hunt's character would have been developed more fully.<p>On the other hand, Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive Archie-Bunker-esque character was the most entertaining part of the movie for me.  Sure, you know he's going to get his comeuppance at some point, and show that he's got a heart of gold underneath, but he was so unlikeable, I had to like him.  Some of these other reviewers are claiming that it's no big deal for Nicholson to play this part, since it's just like his real life persona, but even if this is true I still think it takes some guts to portray a racist, sexist, homophobic freakazoid, and talent to make the character waver between knee-jerk rudeness and lonely humanity.
 | product/productId: 0792841654 | review/userId: A24C863NNAPCLW | review/summary: Rough, Gritty and Raw!!! | review/text: Desperate men caught in a desperate struggle. This film should be viewed with the others depicting the dark early days of our strugle in the Pacific, "They Were Expendable", "Air Force" and "Wake Island". Of the four mentioned, "Bataan" ranks only behind "They Were Expendable" in my book for giving you a portrait of men who are doomed, and KNOW they're doomed, but choose to fight on regardless. This film may qualify as propaganda but barely so. Not overly flattering to their Japanese opponents but not as racist a exercise as "Air Force".  Still you see plenty of atrocities to make the blood boil. What makes this film stand out above other's of its time and ilk was the multi-racial make up of the cast and graphic nature of the violence.<br /><br />In this film you see a man almost beheaded with a samurai sword, another crucified, you see someone machine gunned and the bullet holes are still smoking when he drops. Grim, depressing and sad but strangely uplifting because you know that the Japanese miscalculated and will pay the inevitable price. A tribute to all the un-sung fallen who died in a million jungle hell holes with no one to mark their graves.<br /><br />Da Worfster
 | product/productId: 0780020693 | review/userId: A11C43I615R52G | review/summary: Fellini's most delightful film!! | review/text: Amarcord is an oddball film. It does not have a specific plot or story and there is not a main character with a purpose. Instead, we are introduced to an array of unique individuals each one with its own plots and conflicts. Amarcord follows the life of this town and the characters that populates it. Although there is no story "per se", the movie is very engaging and you'll never feel bored. One of the film merits is that fills the screen with unforgettable characters such as Gradisca, Titta, his parents, the priest, the narrator and more. Also the score by Nino Rota is amazing and enhances the whole experience.<br /><br />Unlike other films by Fellini, Amarcord is pure fun without much subcontext or political themes, the characters just live there, watch each other, tease each other, fight, laugh, etc. Many have said that this film is a biographical one but although it does contain elements that undoubtedly belong to Fellini's life, this film is a creation of his own with dream like sequences, surrealistic scenes and character exaggeration.<br /><br />Amarcord may not be Fellini's finest film but it surely his most delightful one and a true classic in its own right.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Amarcord comes to BD courtesy of Criterion and, as expected, the results are spectacular. The transfer is very strong with superb detail, well reproduced colors and a well preserved grain layer that gives the film a natural look. Sometimes some mild noise creeps in the screen but it's nothing of serious concern. A fantastic transfer.<br /><br />The uncompressed monoaural soundtrack is also superb with astounding clarity and no signs of damage.<br /><br />Bonus Features<br />Amarcord comes with a healthy collection of bonus material that are very interesting to watch:<br />First you have a very informative documentary with professors Peter Brunette and Frank Burke, they analize key scenes in the movie and deconstruct the characters in the film. You should hear it alongside the film.<br />"Fellini's Homecoming" is a great documentary dealing with the complicated relationship between Fellini and his hometown Rimini in which the film is partially based.<br />Then you have an interesting interview with actress Magali Noel (Gradisca) in which she talks about her relationship with Fellini.<br />"Fellini's Drawings" are a collection of sketches that Fellini did during the production on Amarcord.<br />"Felliana" is a collection of publicity material for the film.<br />"Gideon Bachmann Interviews" are a series of interviews that Bachmann conducted with Fellini and his friends and family members.<br />You also have a deleted scene, the trailer, an optional English language for the film and a restoration demonstration.<br /><br />A 64 page booklet is also included which features an essay by San Rohdie "Federico of the Spirits" as well as a collection of remiscences by Fellini called "My Rimini".<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Amarcord is one of the many Fellini masterpieces and it's a must own film. It may not be a very complex film but is pure good quality entertainment. Is a must see for everyone. This Criterion BD features superb picture and sound and a lot of bonus features. This BD is Very Highly Recommended!!

I only just saw it recently when it was on tv and was actually pretty suprised.  I had always seen it in the video store and with the recent release of the whole ten yards I figured I would give it a shot.  Bruce Willis is really funny and needs more roles like this.  This would kind of be your mediocre type movie because it isn't an incredible nor is it crap!  The only sad part is throughout this movie you are thoroughly entertained but its one of those films that when its over you slowly forget about it and theres no reason why you should; if that doesn't make since, I apoligize, lol.<br /><br />Other actors featured are Amanda Peet, Matthew Perry, Michael Clark Duncan, and Kevin Pollack.  The plot is good and quite humourous as are the characters.  I would say that everyone should see this movie at least once, it deserves that much.  And always rent before you decide to buy! Enjoy.

Jen is set with a task to battle against the odds to find a missing shard of the Dark Crystal to be placed into the crystal to make it whole again. All this, in order to restore balance to the world and allow all creatures to live in peace and harmony ever after from the magic-sucking creatures who destroy all. And of course, all of this has to be done before the three suns meet in the sky. In his journey, Jen discovers not only himself, but also meets some interesting and unsavoury characters, as well as the lovely Kira, who joins his quest. Jen needs to decide who to trust and finds himself in some very sticky situations.<p>The director on this film must have had tremendous patience and vision, since all the characters are puppets. Although initially distracting, we soon forget about the puppetry as we become caught up in the fascinating story. Ne'er have I rooted so hard for a hero. The ending is both sweet and sad at once.<p>The puppets allow a tremendous amount of creativity for developing all the different kinds of creatures, both good and evil. To some who don't like puppets, this could be kind of scary, but I find this unusual approach refreshing amidst a time when computer generated graffics are often bad and over used. The artistry of something that is created by humans is both touching and charming and has a genuine/honest feel to it.<p>A predecessor of fantasy film that has yet to be matched by its successors. Truly eloquent. Without doubt, a classic.<br />.
 | product/productId: 5554818374 | review/userId: ARK2ECYUL18CD | review/summary: Rubbish | review/text: This is just one of those predictable dumbed down action movies that leaves you wondering why you just spent 2 hours watching it. The only good thing about this movie is Angelina Jolie is in it. If you are a big Angelina fan you may as well buy it if you see if for real cheap (like 5.99) because there are a healthy amount of extras including interviews with Angelina.<br /><br />But this is just a seen 1 seen em all type movie. I find Nicolas Cage REALLY annoying in this movie although I am a fan of his but I prefer him in dramas and not cheesey action flicks like this.<br /><br />The plot is ok on paper but the dialogue/script is really poor and you just know exactly how this movie will pan out and how it will end....so predictable. The cops were really annoying, especially the young detective...he tried ever so hard to be the cocky/funny type cop that can sometimes be interesting but like everything else in this movie it just fell flat.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones' character was the only mildly interesting character in this film and he doesn't even speak!!! He used to be a soccer player here in England, he was a really dirty, aggressive player so its no wonder he plays a lot of bad guys in his movies.<br /><br />If you like cheesey, flat, predictable action flicks then this is right up your street, some of the car chases are pretty cool but its not quite as thrilling watching these in your bedroom as a pose to a cinema is it? I recommend saving your money & buying Leon instead now there is a great movie.

 | product/productId: 6302260973 | review/userId: A39IBJB2PBVC7I | review/summary: The Reel Deal | review/text: It's easy to see why The Stunt Man has stayed around so long and developed a devoted cult following - it's great fun.  Richard Rush has created an amusing hall of mirrors that relies on the very essence of film - illusion.  Of course, here there are layers of illusion and we're not exactly sure of who is in on the joke and when they've figured it out, which makes it that much more entertaining.<br /><br />While it's inadvisable for writers to write about writers, and for filmmakers to make movies about making movies, it can be done.  Serious students of film looking for deep meaning and symbolism should bypass The Stunt Man altogether and go straight to Truffaut's Day For Night, an extraordinary bit of cinema that blurs the line between celluloid artifice and reality brilliantly, using one to inform the other.  I like to think Mr. Rush did not have such lofty goals in mind for The Stunt Man.  For him, the - What is real? - question is merely a device to advance plot and maintain interest, which it most certainly does.<br /><br />The improbability factor in The Stunt Man is very high; the picture is made plausible and held together through the offices of Peter O'Toole, whose performance is absolutely perfect.  O'Toole is an amazing actor; as director Eli Cross he is megalomaniacal, nearly mad, vain, narcissistic, staggeringly manipulative, and at least a little bit brilliant, in short, close to the popular image of a real director.  While it is easy to focus on his puppet-master control of all events, there are many scenes revealing how he fears the various disasters that may befall his project, not the least of which being his ability to lead.<br /><br />The Stunt Man for whom the picture is named, Cameron, is played amateurishly by Steve Railsback.  (This may explain the long list of movies no one has seen on Mr. Railback's bio.)  It doesn't matter, everyone else in the cast is so good, especially Barbara Hershey, that the film easily survives the damage Mr. Railsback inflicts.  Indeed, it would be worth seeing the picture just to witness the innumerable nameless stuntmen at work, absolutely great.  Not a picture for the art house, this one's for the fun house.  Recommended.

John Wayne's finest | review/text: How could I even begin reviewing this film when so much has been said already. The most I can do is either agree or disagree with what has been said, and I definately agree with the popular vote - this is a suberb film. John Wayne goes out looking for his niece, stolen by comanches after her family is butchered, and doesn't quit till the job is done. A great quest movie with beautiful scenery mostly taking place in Monument Valley, a site this film definately promoted.<p>If you can, purchase the new version released with trailer and a 30 min documentary, hosted by Wayne's son Patrick. It shouldn't be missed, and greatly increases the enjoyment of the picture. A real treat!

 | product/productId: 6301008820 | review/userId: A3LXKO2S6G2DBI | review/summary: Still Great After 30 Years | review/text: Negative comparisions to the Roald Dahl text notwithstanding, &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is the last really great movie musical.  It's miles beyond the motion-sickness-inducing &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or the thighs-in-your-face &quot;Chicago&quot; and has the charm to delight even the least imaginative of us.  The beauty of the film is how well it balances adult cynicism with youthful hope--Dahl's satirical subtexts of European colonialism and slavery (as witnessed by the greed of just about everyone involved and the predicament of the Oopah Loompahs, respectively) are virtually indetectable for children wowed by the colorful production design and memorable songs.  So are the swipes against the Germans, common in British films.  But the core of the story revolves around Charlie Bucket, the poor but kind-hearted boy whose bleak life with his struggling single mother and invalid grandparents is punctuated only by the occasional ray of sunshine.  That he finds the last ticket to compete for a lifetime supply of chocolate is deserved; that he wins against a gaggle of spoiled, obnoxious children that represent the worst of humanity is inevitable.  Peter Ostrum and Jack Albertson are terrific as Charlie and Grandpa Joe, respectively, and Gene Wilder inhabits the wily but world-weary Wonka wonderfully.  Children (and some adults) sometimes becry the darkness of some scenes, as well as Wilder's often biting reactions to them, but they miss the point:  Wonka seeks genuine kindness and decency in a landscape populated mostly by avarice and deceit.  To find an heir that possesses such qualities, he must present both the beautiful and the ugly, and act both the benefactor and the villain.  It is only through witnessing their reactions--and the rotten kids are never put off by the horrible things they see and do--that he can discover which of them deserves to inherit his fortune.  Great songs and uncomplicated special effects add to the air of fantasy that makes this film a winner.

Suddenly, everyone she speaks to ends up dead, while an arrangement of sketchy characters lurk around every corner. Darby Shaw, the young lawyer, tries to outwit everyone and eventually ties her fortunes together with Gray Grantham, a reporter with the Washington Herald.<p>The movie is a fun legal thriller that will give your heart good exercise. 'Yikes' moments are in plentiful supply, and the colourful characters add a compelling element that keeps you interested and excited. <p>The acting is well done. Denzel Washington (Gray Grantham) plays his role wonderfully while Julia Roberts (Darby Shaw) sparkles. They both play well off of each other, and there is a chemistry that reaches the audience.<p>If you like John Grisham's novels, you should see the movies, including this one. Well adapted from the book, the plot line and characters follow the novel honestly, and nothing of lasting significance is taken away in the making of this movie.

There's just something about the way the Coen brothers choose and utilize accents in their movies that make them fun to watch (O Brother Where Art Thou?, The Big Lebowski, Miller's Crossing).  One of Nicholas Cage's best acting performances in my opinion.  If you like comedies that come off as a little odd, then I would recommend this one.

In its own way, just as whacky as the recent Pitt/Jolie vehicle.  But the similarities end there.  Hitchcock's version is basically silly and not especially funny (he may have been a master of suspense, but not comedy), and headlines a slightly chubby Carol Lombard (Hitchcock's landlord who urged him to make the film--apparently against his better judgment).  Robert Montgomery (not the Director's first choice) is the less-than-better half who seems  over his acting head most of the time (especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard's performance).<br /><br />  Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap (and phony).  Very distracting.  Without Lombard, the film would have gone straight to DV...err, the drive-ins.<br /><br />WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.
 | product/productId: 0767014596 | review/userId: AN4DVVJ17GQ9V | review/summary: Remember the Tiananmen Square Massacre | review/text: It has been twelve years since the protesters, demonstrators and other innocent civilians in China, who were aware of and had great love on democracy and peacefully protested in Tiananmen Square by showing grievance to the Communist government, lost the war against the totalitarian government backed by Li Peng and other hard-liners. Although more and more people around the world have started to forget the Tiananmen Square Incident, this inhumane actions led by the Communists on innocent civilians still haunt to and are still remembered by those who survived the massacre unscathed, people related to the dead in Tiananmen Square as well as many people around the world who are still the supporters of democracy while determining to create a whole new world under a new humane order by the rule of democracy.<p>This documentary film is, for the supporters (and, of course, lovers) of democracy around the world, one of the best dramatizations regarding both politics of the world and democracy. It is served as a reference for the exact meaning, essences and functioning of democracy. I can utterly feel what it means for the people who have the character of determination, motivation, optimism, righteousness and confidence, similar to 54th colored regiment of Massachusetts, first colored regiment in U.S. Civil War, led by Colonel Shaw in the film "Glory" and Gandhi and his followers in India, while struggling for democracy for China and the world. Some of the prominent political reformers in the China's Communist Party, like Hu Yao-Bang and Zhao Zi-Yang, had politically made a giant step toward democratic China. But the progress was hampered by the hard-liners within the party by forcing Hu to resign. Hu's death without having his dream of creating democratic China come true led to the protest for democracy from students, workers and other civilians in whole China. Zhao was later discharged by the Communist Party for being liberal like Hu, causing the protest to heighten to a zenith. Since the night of third day of June 1989, soldiers and police officers killed and arrested thousands, perhaps millions, of protesters and others civilians by force. Some were executed, some were in prison or labor camp, some lost the rights of citizenship, others fled in exile. I finally learned that the dictators and their followers have used all the speeches and writings that seems "pleasant" but, most of the time, mislead the civilians and cause resentment and sometimes rage against the governments. The civilians don't even know the governments have lied until the very last minute.<p>Besides this, I also learned that democracy is, in full definition, a government or a principle of a government that allows all civilians to be the equal representatives of the whole body of government, voters and electors for the government and the beneficiaries of the government. It means not only the elite, people of upper class and militants but also people of middle and lower classes as well as everybody. According to Sun Yat-Sen, the father of modern China and, as many people know, the Republic of China (also known as Taiwan), he created a set of doctrines called the Three Principles of the People, which are nationalism, democracy and the social well-being. He also mentioned that democracy is a government of the people, government ruled by the people and, in same importance as the first two, government for the people. It is extremely vital that although democracy is imperfect like other forms of government contrary to it, it is the most suitable form of government in the world.<p>What I liked the most in this documentary was a civilian standing against a column of tanks in an empty street in Beijing. It symbolizes the civilians are standing up and gallantly fighting against dictatorship without the use of violence. It also symbolizes the bravery of the civilians who are never afraid of failing but, rather, being optimistic that the dictatorship will fall while the democracy will rise high in the sky.<p>The war against the dictatorship was lost in China, but the civilians will take revenge until the dictatorship in China collapse. I am extremely sure that later on our lives, more young people who are entering the government will make the political reforms that will satisfy the needs of the civilians. At the same time, the older government officials will slowly retire and decease with time. Soon, democracy will have great victory against totalitarianism in China and the world.<p>If I happened to find the movie or documentaries relating to the true story of the "builders and motivators" for democracy who have the dreams of democratizing the world, like the spreaders of democracy in China Wang Dan, Chai Ling, Uerkesh Daolet (Wuer Kaixi), Li Lu, Shen Tong and Professor and Madam Fang Li-Zhi, "acting on the screen" after their completion, I will come back to Amazon.com to buy them without any hesitation.

It's very long, it has some very depressing parts, and it has a rather odd sense of humor to it. And the frog and &quot;Wise Up&quot; sing-along scenes are a little hard to swallow at first, although &quot;Wise Up&quot; is one of my personal favorite parts of the movie and I've come to love the frogs, too.<p>Anyway, Magnolia is definitely worth renting in my opinion.

Either way, I doubt you'll think it's so-so.
 | product/productId: 1572527099 | review/userId: A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5 | review/summary: Lovely overlooked story | review/text: The first time I saw Dr. Richard Feynman was when he was demonstrating why the space shuttle "Challenger" blew up with a rubber ring and a glass of ice water.  He amazed me then.<br /><br />I didn't actually think about Dr. Feynman's life until I saw "Infinity" available.  Matthew Broderick, who both plays Feynman in the film and directs it.  According to Feynman, he thought of the time depicted in this film as a romance, but it was also time where everything changed in the country.<br /><br />The story begins with Feynman (Broderick) meeting Arlene Greenbaum (Arquette).  They fall in love during pre WWII times.  They're engaged when they learn that Arlene has TB.  Feynman takes his undergrad at MIT and later grad work at Princeton. When he's offered a job at Alamosa, NM to work on the bomb, he accepts so he and Arlene can be wed.  The story briefly touches physics and the development of the a-bomb.<br /><br />What the story really is about is coping with illness during different times.  Back then, doctors didn't want patients to know what their diagnoses were.  Families didn't want their children to marry if there were severe illnesses involved, either.  Aside from his scientific genius, what marked Feynman as extraordinary was that he worked so hard at his marriage and making his wife as happy as she could be.<br /><br />This quiet, overlooked film takes us back to a different time in this country's life.  Broderick did an excellent job of taking us back.  It's well worth a watch if you are interested in either quiet romances or films from this period of time.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2008

 | product/productId: 6302380596 | review/userId: A2GDEPPC8BAZRY | review/summary: All The Time In The World&#65533;(Is Not Enough) | review/text: Australian model (not actor) George Lazenby takes over the role of Bond-James Bond, in this singular yet noteworthy entry into the 007 series.  After having made YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, actor Sean Connery - the original and definitive Bond - had decided to call it quits on her majesty's secret service (a decision which proved to be premature, as he was again the suave spy in the following Bond film, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, as well as later, unofficially, in NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN).  Ah...yesss, well -<p>Despite the deprivation of Connery's sardonic expressiveness, this film does stand, and with firm footing, as one of the best in the series.  It has, after all, the essential elements of a great Bond film:  scenic locations, riveting action, interesting villains, beautiful women, and sly off-hand wit.<p>The pre-credits sequence is right off quite piquing - amply enough to draw one further in:  firstly, you spy our favorite Spy - he's driving his Aston Martin on a road along the shores of the sea; he spies then a beautiful young woman in a red convertible speeding past him; he follows her as she pulls over; then, taking out his spy glasses, watches her run towards the encroaching tide, momentarily pausing to remove her shoes and to stare with a face lined in despair at the wide-open sea; she proceeds then to saunter forth gracefully into the crashing waves, presumably that she may disappear therein forever.  Well, Bond - because he's James Bond - naturally runs out to rescue her from herself.  Romantic, eh?  Well, as Lazenby remarks over the normally unencroachable dints of the fourth wall, &quot;This never happened to the other fella...&quot; Indeed.  But assuredly, it does pick up from here -<p>Diana Rigg is Contessa Teresa di Vincenzo (&quot;Teresa was a saint - people call me Tracy,&quot;) daughter of Corsican mob boss Draco (Gabrielle Ferzetti).  Initially she is the tragic mess that Bond spies on the shore, but she materializes over the following 140 minutes into someone quite substantial.  Rigg, as it turns out, is an excellent actress - she plays here the most romantic, most enigmatically complex and self-destructive of all the Bond girls.  She truly ends up capturing our rugged hero's heart, and Bond resolves to marry her.  Truly Lazenby did have his work cut out for him: following Connery and playing opposite such a strong female lead.  His acting definitely falls a little short - he doesn't exude anything like Connery's confident, smooth and deadly charm - still he does manage somehow to pull off an acceptable enough job here.  His Bond conjures a love story, going places Connery's Bond would never have ventured. His best moments in this movie, in fact, are those he shares with Miss Rigg.  Admittedly though, there may be a slight sense that Rigg somewhat carries him through those scenes.<p>Yet, before Bond can get his girl, he must first pursue his old enemy Ernst Blofeld (Telly Savalas), the cat-fondling megalomaniacal head of SPECTRE, whose latest attempt to take over the world involves the spreading of &quot;that disagreeable outbreak of foot-and-mouth in Britain last year&quot; in order to gain control of the agricultural supply of the world and then blackmail its leaders.  Bond infiltrates Blofeld's headquarters - an allergy clinic, Alpine Piz Gloria, set in the beautiful Swiss Alps - undercover as Sir Hilary Bray, a Scotsman in a kilt there to investigate Blofeld's claim to a noble ancestry.  As the clinic's &quot;clientele&quot; offer to Bond a whole harem of Bond babes, as well as a formidable nuisance of a foe in the overbearing den-mother hag Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat) - I couldn't help my wistful thinking that wearing that kilt, and with his Scottish burr (Lazenby had to use &quot;stunt&quot; voice-over George Baker for his Sir Hilary Bray scenes) and in the company of all those women, Sean Connery would have been no less than stellar...Ahh, but that's just me....<p>In those Alpine scenes are some of the best action sequences in the early history of Bond:  peril on the ski lifts, dodging avalanches, and excellent ski stunt work, including Bond skiing on one ski.  &quot;M&quot; (Bernard Lee), &quot;Q&quot; (Desmond Llewelyn), and Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) are present in this film as ever.  And John Barry's musical score, which includes &quot;We Have All The Time In The World&quot; being sung by Louis Armstrong, is utterly magnificent.<p>Trust me sincerely when I say this is a film worth watching.  Author Ian Fleming wrote a rather dark, atmospheric novel by the same name.  And even though the aggressive qualities of stunt work and special effects were fairly far well limited in the year 1969, they were still exciting to behold. - I need not even mention the fact that Lazenby's performance left much to be desired, but the essence of that novel still manages to survive, and it persists to course its aura over the stretched horizons of the series.

The dialogue is so artificial you can almost see the word balloons. If they'd gone just a little further, it would qualify as camp.<br /><br />Seriously: the plot is so obvious, you know who the mysterious Black Knight is long before anyone in the movie does. The mix-up between which sister loves which knight is projected like a grade school punch line. When Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden) is in bed with a serious injury and it is announced that the winner of the tournament will win the hand of Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh), it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that it is Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) in Gawain's armor that challenges Sir Brack (James Mason).<br /><br />One other element that may be OK for some, but grated on my nerves, is the religious assumptions underlying it all. The villains are Viking pagans, and the heroes are English Christians. The Viking Christians, on the other hand are also heroes. The bigotry is pretty obvious, but in 1954 it was simply taken for granted.<br /><br />Good movie for children, but children these days have probably never read Prince Valiant cartoons in the Sunday Comics. I was still a child myself in 1954, so I suppose we have to assume this was made for the Baby Boom generation. I never saw it then, though; stories with swords and fighting in them to this extent would have been for boys.

When I was younger I saw some scenes in the movie that left me choked up. A black man in the movie was accused of harming the main protagonist and other children.<br />This movie exposed me as a young child to reality  such as racism and cruelty however the ending left me more optimistic and full of hope.<br />This movie isn't very graphic in it's depiction of violence but the theme is there.<br /><br />The movie if anything will teach your children of the grim realities of life however it's not so grim and depressing to the point of haunting your psyche after the credits roll.<br />I think the Lady in White is more of a mystery than a horror movie per se.

When I finally saw it, I was indeed dazzled, but also left with the feeling that I had not so much visited a wonderful city of the future as toured a collection of artifacts from its ruins.  Now I have been there.<br /><br />I fully believe that this film remains a high point, possibly *the* high point, of film-making.  I question whether any later director and crew, with the benefit of sound and color and special effects and the simple advantage of decades of good films to watch and learn from, have ever surpassed it.

 | product/productId: 0767817761 | review/userId: A96K1ZGW56S2I | review/summary: "Give or Take a Lie or Two." | review/text: I happened to catch the last fifteen minutes of SUNSET while flipping through the Western channel on cable. I was so intrigued by the movie that I rented it as soon as I was able to find a copy (not an easy task). The movie stars James Garner as Wyatt Earp and Bruce Willis as Tom Mix. Mix is starring in a movie based on Earp's life and Earp has been brought in to Hollywood to serve as a consultant. The famous lawman and the colorful cowboy quickly become friends and are drawn into a murder mystery that ultimately leads to a shootout on the evening of the first Academy Awards. The movie is funny, has some good action scenes, and even a touch of romance. The film is a tribute to not only the old Westerns, but to the silent movie era in Hollywood. The setting seems very real and there are some great classic cars that are displayed throughout the film. There isn't any sex, hardly any foul language, and the violence is tame. SUNSET is an overlooked gem that's worth mining.
 | product/productId: 155940860X | review/userId: A2NISF94D1UKON | review/summary: One of John Woo's best films. | review/text: This movie is perhaps the best example of an action movie that still retains a story. Woo's characters actually posess emotions and are not just stock characters that shoot each other.<p>My only problems with the DVD are on the technical side. First of all, the video (1.85:1) should have been anamorphic, but like all of Woo's other HK flicks, they are not. The video quality is not spectacular compared to other restorations of older movies (the criterion of Robocop is a good example), but it is far superior to a VHS copy.<p>The audio remains in its original mono format. The soundtrack, especially the beginning of the film, is very unique. I hoped for a 5.1 or at the least a Dolby Surround mix, but at least you get the option of listening to the original language track. I HATE dubbed movies!<p>Overall Quality<br />Film: 9/10<br />Video 7/10<br />Audio 6/10<p>I would suggest this movie to any Woo fan or a person who would like to watch a different type of action movie. Just keep in mind that it is quite violent.

 | product/productId: 6301264185 | review/userId: A2R1HAXRNU0QX7 | review/summary: One of the funniest movies of the last 20 years!! | review/text: An absolutely terrific comedy!!!  I won't rehash the plot much, but let's say that Steve Martin plays a crass, American, two-bit con man trying to move in on a town on the French Riviera, where Michael Caine, a suave, successful, tasteful con man, already runs the show.<p>The men start as rivals, then become reluctant co-conspirators (in the FUNNIEST scenes of the movie, and maybe EVER!), and then, in the extended final act of the movie, rivals again, both trying to con the same woman, a naive American (Glenne Headly, terrific and enchanting as always).<p>Martin gets to show off his best comedic moves here.  His physicality and pure ridiculous side is amply on display, but his more sophisticated, verbal skills are showcased as well.  I'd be willing to say this is best, sustained purely comedic performance.  Michael Caine is PERFECTLY cast as the suave Brit.  He isn't "funny" per se, really the straight man, but he is the perfect foil for Martin, and he is charming and winning.  He's seldom been more appealing and lighthearted.  <p>Frank Oz directed this movie with zest and the right amount of panache.  We enjoy the scenery, and we are eased into the movie slowly.  The tension between the men is allowed to build slowly over time, making the final twists and turns (and there are many delightful ones) all the more fun.  <p>I've seen this film half a dozen times, and I've got all the twists memorized, but there are still scenes I look forward to eagerly, and still laugh hysterically over.  IN one bit, Martin is assigned to play the younger, insane brother of "Prince" Michael.  Caine lures the rich women, gets their money and devotion, and then introduces them to his revolting brother (Martin), who scares the women away, leaving their money behind.  Martin is so unbearably funny, and Caine plays his end so straight that, truly, the five minutes this stuff takes up in the movie may be the single most delightful five minutes you can spend in a screwball comedy.<p>I don't like to toss out the word "classic" too often, but I feel that perhaps this movie warrants it.  I know I'll be watching it again and again in years to come!
 | product/productId: 1404954988 | review/userId: ANCOMAI0I7LVG | review/summary: A little lost in translation... | review/text: I'm not going to lay out the fact that James L. Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.<br /><br />I came at this from a different approach.<br /><br />Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.<br /><br />I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.<br /><br />And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.<br /><br />Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.<br /><br />Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).<br /><br />It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.
 | product/productId: 6302281733 | review/userId: A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB | review/summary: A deliciously Tolkienesque fantasy | review/text: &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was a Jim Henson masterpiece, a skilful marriage of technology and art, a dark, unique creative vision that I believe is superior to &quot;Labyrinth.&quot; The characters are non-human puppets and animatronics, one reason why audiences found it hard to relate to the protagonists Jen and Kira. It has been called &quot;a flawed masterpiece,&quot; but in my eyes it is one of the best fantasy movies ever made. I tried to read all of the Tolkien novels, but this kept my attention far longer and shared some of the same elements (good versus evil, mythical beings, power struggles between ruling clans).<p>Still as fresh and unique as when it was released in 1982, this DVD edition features fantastic extras that enhance the viewing experience, such as a 50 minute documentary of the making of &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; an isolated soundtrack (Trevor Jones' score is gorgeous...this way you get a soundtrack and a DVD at the same time (the original soundtrack is now out-of-print).

John Travolta was the best of the ensemble including Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman and Uma Thurman. When I first saw this film in 1995 I told my wife that I understood calculus better than this plot. After watching a few minutes of this old film on TV I recently decided to see it again and give it a second chance.  It was clear, very funny and I really enjoyed it on my second watch.<br /><br />John Travolta plays a loan shark and collector who doesn't enjoy his line of work or hurting people. In fact, he would really like to make films, his greatest passion. That alone should be enough of a hook to get you to buy or rent this great film.

 | product/productId: 0780628799 | review/userId: A38G64S5VMRI1P | review/summary: Hard to find a flaw | review/text: "Sometimes the green mile seems so long," an aged Paul Edgecomb laments at the film's end. I would have to say that this aptly describes my sentiments during some of the drawn-out stretches of this movie. However, besides it's length, The Green Mile is an otherwise extremely laudable work, displaying the best of cast and crew alike.  Though the screenplay was written and directed by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption), The Green Mile is distinctly Stephen King, the story's author. This means you can expect a sharp plot line, emotionally tumultuous scenes, and novel characters so vivid that each is a story in itself. It goes without saying then, that the screenplay was a very true adaptation of the 6-part novel by King, the most accurate of any King work. <p>The film begins in the modern day with an old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer from Little House) accounting his past as a prison guard on the "green mile," the colorful name given to death row at Coal Mountain Prison in Louisiana. Though the movie has a slow start (which didn't particularly bother me - it's well-suited for the film), we quickly find ourselves in the mid-depression south, 1935, where the main story takes place. <p>John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gargantuan black man with a child's mind, is arrested for a crime  too deplorable to mention.  He finds himself on Cell Block-E, headed by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), awaiting electrocution by "Old Sparky," the name given to the electric chair. (Yes, in a King story even inanimate objects are memorable characters.) <p>Edgecomb quickly realizes that Coffey's nature doesn't match the heinousness of the crime he is accused of. What ensues is the relationship that develops between Edgecomb and Coffey, who seems to have an extraordinary gift - the power of healing. He starts with Edgecomb himself, healing his painful urinary tract infection, and then moves on to Mr. Jingles, the film's little mascot, a mouse that takes a liking to one of the inmates. Mice? Supernatural? Don't fret. Darabont successfully interlaces these seemingly unbelievable scenes so as to make them almost unnoticeable. <p>What is less than subtle are the parallels between John Coffey and another famous J.C. from history, but this is typical of King's and Darabont's work together (Shawshank certainly had its spiritually metaphorical moments). <p>There are two kinds of King movies, the sick-beyond-sick films (such as Pet Sematary), and the more dramatic, Oscar-type efforts (Stand By Me, Shawshank). Though of the latter breed, you'll still get a taste of the trademark disturbed King in the Mile - specifically in a 3-minute death scene, an execution in Old Sparky that goes nightmarishly wrong. (Not for the faint of heart.) The entire sequence is set off by the childish prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) who does as good a job as any antagonist ever at making us hate him. In fact, by the end of this movie you'll find yourself wishing for a fate worse than death for the little brat. (Be patient.) All-in-all the chemistry between the prison guards (Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn) is admirable as well as believable. This camaraderie culminates in their plan to sneak J.C. out of his cell for a special healing. This is the one incident I would call "a little too much" in terms of plot. Something more believable could've been used to accomplish the same plot purposes.  The positives are plentiful. For one, we now have a new star, Michael Clarke Duncan. He gave an emotional (though at times a little over-done) portrayal of Coffey; you'll fall in love with him from the get-go. Though there isn't a weak casting choice (hats off to Mali Finn), Duncan dominates the movie with his loveable character. <p>The characters are as only King could conjure. Even in the few brief cameo moments we have with Gary Sinise we feel as though we have known him and his family for years. Also distinctly King? Mr. Jingles, the amiable mouse that frequents the green mile. Who else could successfully weave a mouse into an otherwise somber prison movie?<p>Less than extraordinary are the bookmark present-day scenes, bracketing the beginning and ending of the movie. We see this in all the latest epics, don't we? Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, etc. It's overdone. Though it's far less annoying in the Mile than in Titanic, I found these flash-forwards to be even more unnecessary. They serve no discernable purpose. It could have been worse, however, since Darabont wisely wrote out a character from the modern-day segment, an orderly that was harassing the old Edgecomb (included as a typological Percy in King's original work). <p>And finally, the one element missing that could have made this film that much more memorable would have been good music. Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Erin Brockovich) did not produce a score worthy of the cinematography. Zimmer or Horner would have been far superior options.<p>Final word? Don't miss the Mile. It's an emotionally charged movie that may even be a little underdone (in a positive sense), something very rare in today's over-the-top flicks. But be prepared for a long sit and a few tears. The Mile hits you where it hurts, in seeing injustice done to the bearer of truth. Of course you'll also see the best side of Stephen King, and we, like Paul Edgecomb, will see that miracles can happen anywhere.
 | product/productId: 0792837622 | review/userId: A3ACRPV8IRCW3 | review/summary: Hate Triggers Death And Sorrow | review/text: The ironic thing is, this movie was trying to point out peace and discrimination issues, and being made in 1961, led to an era of peace and anti-discrimination battle cries. This movie is in retrospect, the best musical of all time. With its deep mysertious characters and chaotic plot, the movie keeps you gripping your seat til the dramatic conclusion. The Puerto-Rican sharks vs. the manhattan raised Jets take you once again back to the time of when gangs roamed the dirty side of the cities. the plot (William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' brought to a new time period and light) revolves around the characters of immigrated Puerto-Rican Maria, her sister Bernardo, his girlfriend Anita, Maria's given lover Chino, Her real lover Tony, who's best friends with Riff, who's the leader of the Jets. With a rumble following a community dance where Maria and Tony first meet, the leaders of the Sharks and the Jets, Bernardo and Riff, are knifed and killed. Overcome with emotion, Tony, who killed Bernardo after Bernardo killed Riff, wants to turn himself in, and finds himself unworthy of Maria's love. Chino has Bernardo's gun, and a bullet he intends to use on Tony. Maria can't see the hate, she wishes to love everyone and everything. But taking sides involves hate unfortunately, and love is stuck in the middle of it. The movie comes to an end with Tony being shot by Chino, and Maria finally gets the message out to everyone: Hate can cause so much sorrow, why do people even hate? The movie has many brilliant dance and song numbers, and a deep, revolving plot. The fast paced number America ("Things are all right in America! If you're a white in America!") brings latin spirit and is a simply amazing seaquence to the film. Winner of 11 Acadamy Awards, more than any musical has ever won, this movie clearly states all over it that it is a true classic.

They are too long and filmed not  for the artt of movie making, but for the art of money making! Oliver Stone  has never been anything but a real movie maker provoking our thought  processes with each movie made. He has done it again with Any Given Sunday,  a technical and dramatic masterpiece. You do not have to be a football fan  to enjoy this flick or the incredible acting performances of Al Pacino and  Jamie Foxx, but it will help to understand the locker room jargon if you  are. But here, Stone delivers a stimulating account of inside the NFL, and  the boys that play the game. I was very impressed with the photographic  clips of the game action, and the scintillating sound effects of the  &quot;noise&quot;of the game. It told us that the violence is real, and  that boys never stop being boys when playing the game. The relationship  that grows between Pacino, the tired old coach, and Foxx, the third string  quarterback thrown into action, is brought out beautifully by Stone, who  never seems to get much credit for his work. Here again, the visuals are  stunning. I also like the work of Cameron Diaz, the daughter of the owner  who takes control of the team when her father dies. She's tough, and  believable in the roll.I really liked this movie, including a great plt  twist at the end....I bought the DVD, and watched three times in two weeks.  To me, its a strong buy!

John the... Brother of Don Pedro (lol) was a self-said villain in this story, and never changed his viewpoint at all. It's not that Reeves couldn't act this character, it's because all of the other characters change at some point and give a better atmosphere to the story.<p>Keaton, however, should have enunciated his malapropisms better. When watching it, I could barely hear his lines, unless he was screaming out that, 'Let it be known, I am an ... lol Sometimes I referred back to the play to know what it was he was mumbling. His portrayal was good, but his delivery? Geh, too soft-spoken. The humor was wasted on that role due to his boring recital of the lines. His lines are devoid of emotion where he should have shown that he was confident in what he said.<p>All in all, it was a good movie. I really enjoyed seeing how Reeves took nothing which would barely be more than anything with the role of Don John and made it into where I enjoyed seeing his evil presence bent on thwarting love. Keaton's only saving grace was to ride away on invisible stallions. It and the proclomation of his lack of integrity were the only parts when I laughed.

 | product/productId: 078322799X | review/userId: A3JD8FDS3CO3GH | review/summary: A great time guaranteed for cult movie fans | review/text: In 1995, Peter Jackson was a New Zealand-born filmmaker who was known only to cult movie fans for a series of low-budget gorefests which were so remarkable they established his standing as a very talented, if somewhat sick and twisted, director. With such films as Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles and the legendary Dead Alive (aka Braindead) to his credit, Jackson established himself as a macabre genius with a vivid imagination and a keen eye for visual details. With Heavenly Creatures in 1994, he showed that he was capable of much more than just blood, gore and sick humor. He could actually tell real stories of human drama in a powerful way. That wouldn't have been so surprising had his previous film not featured a man being killed by a walking pile of severed intestines. No one had any idea at this point that this guy from New Zealand would go on to make three of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />In 1995, Peter Jackson made a return to comedy-horror with The Frighteners. While it's much less extreme than the likes of Dead Alive, The Frighteners is a wonderful mix of horror and humor and remains a very impressive directorial effort. Michael J. Fox stars as a psychic con man who gets his ghost pals to terrorize someone house so that he can offer his services to get rid of them. Also appearing are Trini Alvarado, Chi McBride, John Astin, Dee Wallace-Stone, Jake Busey, and R. Lee Ermey. One of the highlights of the movie is Re-Animator star Jeffrey Combs' hilarious performance as a weirdo FBI Agent.<br /><br />The Frighteners' plot, concocted by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh,  is not exactly groundbreaking but it certainly does the job. This movie marked (I think) Peter Jackson's first use of digital special effects. The movie is filled with special effects from start to finish. His effects company, WETA, got their feet wet here experimenting with many techniques that would be put to use on Jackson's next project, The Lord of the Rings. Seeing The Frighteners after the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you can plainly see Jackson's genius at work. Even though the material is certainly not of the same magnitude, Jackson's visual prowess and strong imagination are very visible. His camera movements are always interesting, such as his fondness for steadicam and handheld shots. His frequent use of wide-angle lenses helps to lend a kind of surreal, wacky feel to some scenes. And of course, there's plenty of goofy humor as you would expect. There's a pretty memorable scene involving Judge (John Astin) and a mummy in a museum. Any scene involving Jeffrey Combs is hysterical.<br /><br />The Frighteners is a highly-enjoyable movie that fans of Peter Jackson must see. The movie, not too surprisingly, did not find its audience in theaters, but developed a devout cult following on video. Cult fans are really the best audience for this movie. It's a bit too offbeat for mainstream audiences. You can see from this movie that there is a very talented and imaginative director at the helm, one who is capable of great things. Indeed Jackson went on to make The Lord of the Rings trilogy after this, so obviously he is capable of great things. The Frighteners is less concerned with characters and story, it's more about humor and special effects, so no one is likely to proclaim it a masterpiece. But it's certainly a great time, for those who enjoy this type of thing.<br /><br />This new DVD edition, Peter Jackson's Director's Cut, is basically the 1998 laserdisc on DVD. It features Jackson's first feature commentary track, plus the legendary 4-hour documentary The Making of The Frighteners, which was produced by PJ himself. The Director's Cut is a longer cut of the movie, extended by about 13 minutes. I can't say if its superior to the theatrical cut, but it just fleshes things out a bit more and adds a bit more characterization. The 16:9 widescreen transfer is very good.  It looks like new movie, not one that's ten years old. This is a great DVD edition of a very good movie, one that fans are sure to love. Highly recommended for cult fans or anyone interested in Peter Jackson's development as a filmmaker.
 | product/productId: 0783221088 | review/userId: AQ990HW13DP08 | review/summary: the fear factor 50 years later | review/text: With fifty feature-length films to his credit, Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) churned out nearly a film a year for the better part of his adult life. 2008 marks the 50th anniversary of Vertigo, a film of dark dreams, obsession of a type that is more like possession, madness, fear, love and guilt. And no small amount of mystery and intrigue until the final minutes. Set in San Francisco, Jimmy Stewart stars as Scotty, a detective who had to retire from the police force because of a traumatic experience with heights. We know what his vertigo begot in the first minutes of the film, but not in the very last scene. Scotty does his college friend Gavin a favor, which is to tail his wife Madeleine who has been "possessed" by the long-dead Carlotta Valdes. That kindness turns out to be a distinctly bad idea. The scenery, the ominous musical score, the now quaint roles of gender and justice, and Hitchcock's genius for mining the depths of the human psyche all make Vertigo well worth watching fifty years on.
 | product/productId: 0792837347 | review/userId: A1M65AR0MGWSU1 | review/summary: A near-masterpiece | review/text: Although definitely quirky in spots, this Western has the "ring of truth" as it portrays much more realistically than most Westerns life as it really was at the time and place depicted. No heroes, but real people. I like John Wayne as much as the next guy, but most of his roles were a bit cartoonish compared to the more fully realized characters in this flick. I'll put this movie up there with "True Grit" (both versions/visions), "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "All the Pretty Horses", "Lonesome Dove" and "The Shootist" as among the best of the best Westerns. If there were 4.5 stars, I would give it that. This movie is to Westerns what Deer Hunter is to Vietnam films.

 | product/productId: 1565807553 | review/userId: A1LLQQIE90JC7O | review/summary: Amazing | review/text: Watching this film, I found that it was not what I expected.  It's not like Suicide Club; there is much less gore and much more storyline, and the movie wraps itself up without leaving too many important questions unanswered, but its purpose is NOT to explain those left behind by Suicide Club.  It simply takes place before, during, and after the events of Suicide Club.<br />It's a beautifully profound, thought-provoking movie with many important things to say about society and one's relationships with other humans and our families.  The film is long but memorable and one-of-a-kind.  I've never seen a movie that I could compare to this.<br />Although it's long, I wholeheartedly suggest that you see it.
 | product/productId: 0792898605 | review/userId: A218ZOID5KTHGV | review/summary: AKIRA - A misunderstood classic | review/text: When I first heard friend and the UK press banging on about this movie back in 1994, I thought it was worth a look.<br /><br />Upon first viewing I did feel slightly confused as it didn't seem to be the whole story as described.  As it turned out the Anime and Manga are totally different animals.<br /><br />The manga actually does feature Akira in a key role, whereas the film (planned while the manga series was still running in Japan) removes any real direct involvement he has in the story.<br /><br />Opting instead for the story of Tetsuo Shima.  Telling the tale of his rather awkward angst-ridden teenage rebellion against powers and situations beyond his control.<br /><br />Chances are, Americans will love the last action-packed 30 minutes with its' guns, mutation, death and mass destruction.<br /><br />But in my humble opinion the manga presents us with a fully developed world and each of our lead character's individual story arcs are given satisfying conclusions - and so is vastly superior to this over-rated, much hyped piece of Japanese Popular Culture and Animated Action Cinema.  There simply isn't enough time to give Otomo's post-apocalyptic world the time and attention needed to grab an increasingly restless, impatient modern audience.<br /><br />I was 14 when I first saw the Streamline Pictures dub (still included on the most recent Region 2 UK and Region 4 Australian releases) and it took me several viewings to truly understand all aspects of Otomo's multi-layered film version of Akira.  Over the years my appreciation for this smaller scaled story has increased steadily.  As I matured, so did my tastes in movies.<br /><br />The Geneon/Pioneer 2001 dub is truer to the original script but totally unnecessary.  Akira is best enjoyed in Japanese with the new Subs.<br /><br />I actually have three slightly different subbed versions: The Manga/Island World Communications UK VHS, The BBC broadcast version (not too different from the video) and the Pioneer Literal Translation Script of the Japanese (used for the Region 1, 2 & 4 DVD releases).<br /><br />You really are best revisiting the movie once you have read the Manga.  I guarantee you will come back to the anime version with a deeper understanding of the intricate plot.<br /><br />To all those who want a throw-away movie experience - go watch a Poke'mon movie instead.<br /><br />If you can you should Import the Region 2 UK version (available from amazon.co.uk) with the old dub on a second disc with the 4:3 video transfer plus Dolby digital 2.0 Dual Mono (Front Left Channel & Right Channels - no surround sound) or the Madman Entertainment single disc Region 4 version with all 3 audio tracks on the same disc with the 2001 Pioneer Widescreen Re-mastered Version.<br /><br />The 2 disc American releases have more extras (on the restoration and re-dubbing, plus capsule option - translation of Japanese signs and graffiti) if you like that kind of thing.<br /><br />Happy viewing!!
 | product/productId: 0790733897 | review/userId: A2NX99GVAX4TRP | review/summary: The Famous Chase and McQueen at his best ! | review/text: Steve McQueen became the American Anti-hero in Bullitt.  He wore the part very well, becoming Frank Bullitt, a police detective who was interested in doing the best job he could with least amount of politics and brown-nosing.  He could be trusted and he had been involved on several high profile cases which received media attention which resulted in the press and the public having a high opinion of him.  But he's just a cop doing his job. He's seen a little too much, and has a developed a thick skin.  <p>The plot is a little difficult to follow because it's presented  entirely from Bullitt's perspective.  Therefore some of the major plot points are not emphasized and might slide by you un-noticed if you aren't playing Detective along with Bullitt.<p>The film is also somewhat leisurely paced from what most audiences are used to seeing.  It's the antithesis of a dumb action thriller--even though its a film famous for it's still hair-raising car chase which takes place mostly on the hilly streets of San Francisco.  And another thrilling chase scene on an airport runway.<p>In fact it was a film that was shot entirely on location and great attention has been taken to details.  The hospital scenes were actually shot in a wing of a hospital and real doctors and nurses played the doctors and nurses in the scene -- not actors.  Robert Vaughn magnificently plays the utterly untrustworthy and oily slick rich politician.  He's used to having people say yes to him and do exactly what he wants, when he wants it.  And he's also used to keeping his nose clean and being portrayed by the press as a squeaky clean, near perfect conservative politician.  He's requested Bullitt to keep a valuable mob informant safe from harm over the weekend, so he can present the informant to the Senate to testify. Vaughn is playing a dark Bobby Kennedy on a quest to grab headlines and political power by exposing the mob.<p>Bullitt accepts the assignment but notices right away that people have already been sloppy in choosing the room the informant is in, and other matters.  It's not a particularly hard assignment, and Bullitt is not overly concerned about it.  It's his job, no big deal.  <p>However, the mob informant is acting rather strangely, and while another office is on watch duty, two hitmen enter the hotel room and blow away the informant and shoot the police officer.  The informant isn't quite dead yet and is rushed to the hospital.  When the officer tells Bullitt the informant let the people who shot them into the room, Bullitt realizes something is very fishy about the set-up.<p>Vaughn is of course furious and he will need a scape-goat to take the fall if his star witness can't testify.  That scapegoat is going to be Bullitt.<p>When the informant dies, Bullitt keeps his death a secret at first.  He wants to get to the bottom of things, not because he's worried about Vaughn but because its his job and maybe somehow Vaughn was involved with it also.  <p>Robert Duvall pops up in the film as a taxi-driver.  Jacqueline Bissett looks beautiful as Bullitt's devoted girlfriend, who is worried his job is making him too cold, too tough and too distant.  Norman Fell is also quite good in a supporting role.<p>There is beautifully realized scene back at the crime scene, where  Bullitt is going over (in his mind) all of the information he has.  He is re-playing what may have happened in the room, seeing if there is some piece of information or piece of information he's over-looked.  There are several cuts in the scenes, showing us what Bullitt is looking at, how he is focusing intensely on solving this perplexing and high profile case. There is no music in the scene, and no dialogue.  It's a brilliant scene and one only a handful of directors today would have the power to keep it in their film.<p>Throughout Bullitt, you will notice how sound and particularly silence is used.  There's a great late 60's jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin (who is best known for his Mission Impossible theme), but there's also the sound of silence which is used very effectively in the film, and the sounds of late 60's automobiles racing through the streets of San Francisco.  Director Yates is a cameraman and editor himself, he knows how to make a sequence work to its fullest effect. In this film he used William A Fraker as his cinematographer who create a realistic yet smooth (as opposed to a rough documentary type)look for the film.  The film was written by Alan R. Trustman.  It was nominated for a Best Sound Oscar and won an Oscar for Best Editing.<p>This is one of the best performances Steve McQueen ever gave.  He gives the role the intensity and depth it warrants while still moving about as gracefully as a Panther.  Bullitt and Junior Bonner remain my favorite McQueen performances.<p>Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F. Holder - A steamy cyber thriller available January 2001.

It is exceedingly well done.  The casting could not have been better.  Of course, anything with Ed Harris, Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, and Kevin Bacon must be well above average.  For those of you who were not alive in the 1960's, you will want to watch this to improve your cultural awareness of major historical events in America.  Not everyone was on drugs, thank goodness.  You might also enjoy "Space Cowboys" (another all-star cast: Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner-still Hunks after all these years.)

 | product/productId: 6300215814 | review/userId: A2ZC678TIH3MRX | review/summary: Improvement on the best movie of all time! | review/text: Breakfast at Tiffany's has been my favorite movie for a very long time. . .long before I even knew what a DVD was.  Audrey Hepburn is breathtaking and delightful in her performance of Holly Golightly.  The story is one of human relations, and one woman's struggle to face her greatest fear--herself.  Holly must realize that it's not the rest of the world that's keeping her down, she's doing it all on her own.  And who better to help her figure that out than her charming and witty upstairs neighbor Paul (George Peppard)?  I didn't think the film could be improved in any way, but the DVD is awesome.  The picture quality is ten times better, as is the sound.  And of course you get all wonderful extras that usually come with the DVD packages.  This is an excellent introduction into both the world of Audrey Hepburn, and the world of DVD.
 | product/productId: 6301750691 | review/userId: A1S3C5OFU508P3 | review/summary: Simultaneously absurd and entertaining | review/text: When I was young, a television show for children called "Dr. Max" aired M-F at 4 PM. At one time, they aired the twelve episodes of this serial and my brother and I rushed home to watch it. Despite the bad acting, ridiculous costumes and horrendous logical absurdities, we were fascinated with the action and disappointed when the last episode was over. While it was out of my mind, it was not forgotten, so when I encountered the name of this serial in a book, I had to immediately go online and buy a copy. It was money well spent, although the logical absurdities are even more so now and the acting has not improved, I enjoyed watching it as much this time as I did when I was young.<br /> Ray "Crash" Corrigan is an athletic naval officer that goes with Professor Norton in a super submarine in search of the lost continent of Atlantis. The ruler of Atlantis finds them and uses a tractor beam to pull the sub into Atlantis, which looks surprisingly like the places where westerns were filmed. There are two factions fighting for control of Atlantis, there is the evil ruler Unga Khan that wants to take over the upper world and the good high priest Sharod that wants Atlantis to return to a kinder, gentler state.<br /> The opposing armies are in white and black robes respectively and carry swords while riding on horseback and in chariots. However, there are also aerial bombs, death rays and robots that look like garbage cans with appendages. The most ridiculous aspect is the fact that Atlantis is supposedly deep under the sea, sheltered by a rock dome and yet there is a day/night cycle.<br /> Despite all of this nonsense, I loved watching it and recommend it to people as an example of how the serials could simultaneously be entertaining and absurd.

 | product/productId: 6302224462 | review/userId: A3CJE9CW4TNW7P | review/summary: Strictly Average DVD | review/text: This DVD is of strictly average -- maybe even below average -- quality. Video quality is superb, better than the lastest VHS edition for sure and an improvement on the TCM widescreen prints. <p>The audio is 2.0 Mono but probably the best 2.0 mono I've heard. They haven't gone back and restored the audio track to make the gunfire sound clearer or anything like that but the sound does sound better than it did on video and TV. The Spanish sound track is a bit muffled (as always on these older movies) but sounds all right. <p>Special features aren't too "special". There's a cleaned up theatrical trailer (which has Richard Jaeckel screaming in pain when he falls from the cliff, that's not in the movie) 16 chapter selections, subtitles in English, French and Spanish and as I said the Spanish audio track. <p>There is no deleted footage, no production notes, no typical MGM booklet, and no feature about the real Devil's Brigade. All of that would have been interesting and improved the quality of this DVD. But, as it is, the transfer of the actual movie is very good and the DVD is worth say ten dollars just for the movie.<p>As for the movie, you can read all about on the IMDb. I give it 3/stars out of five; the characters were cardboard the could all have been better. That sequence with the brigade capturing 200 Germans in the village was also corny as ever.
 | product/productId: 0767817451 | review/userId: A1AISPOIIHTHXX | review/summary: 2.5; it's barely mind-numbing fun | review/text: For a long time, I never got the hate that was put on the "re-imagining" of Japan's monster mascot: Godzilla. Sure the movie at times was slow and casting choices were questionable but it had a kind of dumb fun aspect to it, like you couldn't get over how ridiculous it felt. Revisiting the film recently however finally made me realize whatever one saw right when it first came out: this is a dumb movie period with only fleeting amounts of good filmmaking attached to it. I like Independence Day and Stargate and even enjoyed the Day After Tomorrow but this...I don't know what this is.<br /><br />Born out of nuclear testing in the French Polynesian islands, a lizard grown to monstrous size is making its way to New York. On hand to help out the military is Nick Tatapoulos, a scientist specializing in nuclear affected organisms, namely that of earthworms. His former girlfriend, Audrey, is a fledging-yet-struggling news reporter with friends "Animal" and Lucy. Arriving in New York is Gojira, a massive lizard who gets named Godzilla by the media and Nick, Audrey and Animal have to escape New York while evading the massive beast.<br /><br />This is one of those cast lists where it's hard to enjoy the film because they picked odd choices for their actors. While Jean Reno can make anything cool, when you think action hero you don't necessarily think Matthew Broderick. I like him in smaller movies like Election but here he seems kinda...wimpy. A nice touch though is having 3 Simpsons actors, Azaria, Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright appear with the former 2 getting the more better outings (Cartwright is strictly a cameo). As for the lizard himself, I don't actually mind his design but turning him into basically an animal rather than this vicious stomp-everything tank was kind of a mistake. They try to create sympathy at the ending but it comes across like a bad idea that never changed all the way through.<br /><br />Effect-wise it seems kind of possible. Like him or not, Emmerich movies tend to be the most coolest visually with many people going simply because there's a grandiose aspect to them. Godzilla is kind of hit-and-miss with some shots being well animated and seamless while others just look way too obvious and green-screened. The title character is similar with many shots looking really great while others have that kind of unfinished look at times. It's better than a guy in a suit of course but maybe someone with a more critical eye like Spielberg or Cameron would've done this best.<br /><br />The film itself just feels sluggish. When he actually makes his initial appearance in Manhattan, it's as exciting as anything from Independence Day but then at a certain point something weird happens: he disappears for a good chunk of the movie. This happened in a way with ID4 where the aliens attacking, the best part of the movie became a big talky movie until the finale. This film isn't quite as uneven but the scenes don't really have the energy needed it's like it feels neutered. At times it's great like when he makes havoc on New York but other times it just doesn't quite cut it.<br /><br />I liked ID4 and Stargate but this is quite the blemish. It's hard to even recommend anything about it without going "well no that wasn't good either". Rent at your own risk.
 | product/productId: 6302272602 | review/userId: AFZ41PKYX29G0 | review/summary: One of Lee's Best | review/text: I once heard on a TV talk show that you don't have to be a parent to know about kids.  This was uttered by a single female with tons of doctorate credentials.  As I listened, having kids of my own, I found her comments clinical and devoid of those fundamentals any parent experiences during daily contact with their offspring.  I subsequently disregarded most of her observations with the exception of the obvious.  Some things do have to be experienced.  With that said, Spike Lee's School Daze had to be experienced to really appreciate the social comments being made.  Being a graduate of Howard University (an Afro-American college since federal inception) in Washington, D.C., I could readily identify with the life and social levels depicted.  This movie is FUBU (For Us By Us).  The distinction between light skinned and dark skinned, &quot;good hair&quot; and &quot;kinks&quot;, &quot;Greeked&quot; (Fraternity/Sorority) and outsiders, upper-class, middle-class and no-class, may be lost in an already segmented society.  However, it hits home to anyone (irregardless of ethnic background) who has attended historically rooted colleges and universiies.  The voluntary (and involuntary!) sub-segmentation on campus is real and extant.  Spike Lee's direction, musical scenes and comedic comment, gives us a laugh at these really stupid concepts.  Laurence Fishburne as usual gives an excellent performance as a politically aware student, trying to change a system that cannot be changed, and personally changing because of it.  Spike Lee plays his usual &quot;Baby, baby, pleaseee baby, baby&quot; self-depreciating character caught-up in fraternity life but willing to play for the perceived rewards of acceptance.  Giancarlo Esposito is the fraternity leader and movie antagonist bent maintaining class/segment separation.  Tisha Campbell (Martin - TV show co-star) plays Esposito's &quot;girlfriend&quot; and gives an excellent performance as a &quot;have&quot; who is victimized by her own would-be ascension and maintenance of same.  This movie demonstrates our society's nature for congregation by segregation as we matriculate through a &quot;Black&quot; college and the surrounding urban community.  View this movie with an inquisitive mind and you'll find it a very entertaining movie.  View it with a similar background and it will haunt you.  On a lighter note, of all the musical numbers one of my favorite scenes is the talent show when Tisha Campbell belts out a soul-stirring song so strong I want to &quot;play&quot; (read blast) it every summer when the weather is hot, the windows are rolled-down and the world is out.

Baseketball, basketball with baseball rules, starts out in their driveway and becomes national sport. Squeak Scolar played by Dian Bahar comes to their house to shut off their gas.  He eventually ends up living with them.  In Baseketball you can do something called a &quot;Psyche Out&quot; where can you taunt your opponent (no limits).  The Psyche Out's are one of the things that makes the movie so funny.  <p>The funniest games they played where against San Francisco and against Texas.  For Coop to own the Milwaukee Beers he has to win the Denslow Cup.  There is a short, funny segment with Robert Stack from Unsolved Mysteries. This is a great DVD with lots of special features (my favorite, the Reel Big Fish video &quot;Take On Me&quot;, but maybe that's just because I like RBF.  If you like &quot;South Park&quot; humor or &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; this is a must own.  Otherwise, just rent it.  R.I.P. Dale Earnhardt.<p>Oh yea, I have seen this movie 8 times.

 | product/productId: 079074449X | review/userId: A37S3ACL57LN62 | review/summary: A Disappointment | review/text: A town called Brigadoon appears in a remote area in Scottland once every one hundred years. A resident prayed for a miracle, to isolate his beloved hometown from the evils of the world, so they appear and disappear without becoming affected by the outside world. The consequence is that no one can leave its gates. When two travelers (Gene Kelly, Van Johnson) stumble upon the town, they are baffled by its quaintness, but one soon falls in love with a local girl (Cyd Charisse). Can he decide between his modern life in New York and the love of his life?<br /><br />A cool idea is ruined by bad direction. Vincente Minnelli uses hardly any close-ups to illustrate that his two main characters are falling in love; they're both beautiful so why not show their faces? The long shots display the large crowds well, but it seems stagy and far from intimate. It would be understandable if the scenery was beautiful, but the painted backdrops are painfully obvious. What separates the film from the stage show? Not much. A few songs are cut because they were considered to be too risque at the time, although some of Johnson's sharper lines were retained. ("Oh we have [witches]. We pronounce it differently.")<br /><br />The only two memorable songs are "Go Home to Bonnie Jean" and "Almost Like Falling in Love." However, the stagings aren't all that impressive. "Bonnie Jean" does have an interesting dance break with Kelly and Johnson together. They're polar opposites; Kelly is graceful and compact while Johnson is clunky and showy. They work well off of each other and provide the best of both worlds.
 | product/productId: 6302131030 | review/userId: A1HX00DL0SZM1G | review/summary: Fascinating depiction of medieval warfare | review/text: You need a strong fortitude to make it through this movie on medieval warfare starring a still largely unknown Rutger Hauer (the cult favorite BLADE RUNNER at that time was still considered a failure in 1985) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (whatever happened to her). It's an entertaining movie if highly exploitative, that portrays the gruesome days of hand-to-hand swordmanship with the requisite amount of gore and bloodletting in addition to shots of severed limbs and people suffering from the bubonic plague.<br />The story centers on charismatic mercenary Martin and his followers (including WHEN HARRY MET SALLY's Bruno Kirby). After being promised the spoils of a castle if they help a King capture it they are betrayed by said ruler and banished from the land. Understandably a little miffed its not long before Martin is heading back to seek his revenge on the ruler and attain the riches which he feels his band was cheated of.<br />So Martin and friends ambush the king's carriage that is escorting the rulers son's bride Agnes (played by Leigh) back for a royal wedding.  Leigh is one of Hollywood's most appealing actresses and here she is in one of her first roles really throwing caution to the wind, in addition to most of her clothes. It's not surprising that Hauer's character falls for her and intends to keep her for himself.<br />The son Steven (played excellently by Tom Burlinson) is an inventor of sorts and a lot of the needed humor (needed to lighten an otherwise dark and foreboding picture) comes from his sheer ingenuity and the dogged manner in which he continues his crusade to save Agnes.<br />Really one should know what to expect from a Paul Verhoeven directed movie. This was the same man who gave us the violent ROBOCOP, the twisted sexual thriller BASIC INSTINCT and the exploitative SHOWGIRLS. This movie is full of sex, nudity, gore and rape (perhaps the most disturbing one put to film since Susan George's scene in STRAW DOGS).<br />That's not to say this movie isn't entertaining. I had not planned to watch it all the way through in one sitting but 10 minutes in and I cpuld not turn my eyes away from the screen, it's a well crafted story that is both fascinating and yet repulsive in the same breath.<br />Recommended

 | product/productId: 0800185218 | review/userId: A2CW9IQAPFEYLM | review/summary: The fine line between idealism and insanity | review/text: Crackerjack entertainment - with an insightful "war is crazy" message to go along with it. A company of British soldiers is captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge over the Kwai. A battle of wills develops between the Japanese commander (played by Sessue Hayakawa) and the British one (Alec Guinness) over officers' rights; Guinness wins out and virtually takes over command of the camp, getting the bridge built with typical British efficiency.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an American prisoner (William Holden) escapes and returns with a commando unit set on blowing the bridge up. Guinness's ego has so taken over that when he spots the explosive charges and wires on the bridge, and suddenly realizes what's about to happen, he actually tries to stop it from blowing up. But too late: the bridge is blown to smithereens and so are Guinness and Holden. War's madness.<br /><br />Guinness's slide into insanity is slow and subtle - and totally believable. He will not give the Japanese the satisfaction ever of assuming they can control or intimidate the British; after all, there are rules in war and "gentlemen" play by the rules. Gentlemen also perform to the best of their abilities, no matter what the task - even if it means building a bridge for the enemy. But he's in this game too deeply and his insanity is a loss of reality.<br /><br />Everything works in this picture, with the biggest winner being British fortitude (though American practicality deserves a pat on the back, too). At first we are caught up in Guinness's seemingly noble actions, all that admirable British stiff upper lip behavior, and when the truth hits us, it's devastating. That's because David Lean's direction is perfect; he's like the poker player who knows he's got the winning Ace up his sleeve and timing is everything. The movies won a fistful of Oscars and deservedly so.

 | product/productId: 0783241321 | review/userId: A112BDFYMILEKW | review/summary: Give Me More! | review/text: I really enjoyed this movie and thought that it was very well done, but I was disappointed to see that there weren't more details on the rise to Andy Kaufman's fame.  How did he become accepted enough to get onto Saturday  Night Live?  The movie jumps right in to Andy's fame.  I wish that there  were more.  It just wasn't long enough.<p>One other grievance that I have  with this film is that Courtney Love didn't do a great job.  While watching  the film, I didn't believe that she was really in love with him.  I kind of  wish that she had done a better performance.<p>But all in all I thought  that this was a pretty good film, and I would definitely recommend it to  anyone who liked Kaufman's career, or finds him even the least bit  intruiging.  It really gives great insight to understand the unusual comedy  stylings of Andy Kaufman.

Intrigued at what he had to say, I wanted to hear more.<br /><br />Purchased the 4 CDs set, so I could listen to his book while driving in my car. Couldn't be happier with this material.<br /><br />What Dr. Wayne Dyer helps you to understand is what the Power of Intention is, and how it is a key component in everyone's life and how to connect to the "source" and redirecting your life toward what YOU are seeking in your life.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Power of Intention for anyone who is wanting more out of their life, today.

The story is conveyed very well and displays some of the best actinf I've ever seen.  Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall with OCD incredibly well and invents this character to a degree where by the end of the film, it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.  Highly reccommended.

I don't know where Arch Hall, Jr. is today, but you have to feel sorry for him (Joel and the bots are merciless - but it's nothing less than what any of them deserved for being in this film!).

 | product/productId: 1586550101 | review/userId: A137PZHS384LU2 | review/summary: Was this... supposed to be... funny? | review/text: Ah... Apocalypse Zero... What can I say besides the fact that there were so many loopholes in this story I was utterly mystifyed as to the point of this ridiculous series. Normally, violence doesn't bother me, and being a fan of such titles as Berserk and Akira, I figured that Apocalypse Zero wouldn't be too bad.<br />Boy, was I WRONG. In fact, it was just disgusting. The whole time I was wondering "What the heck is going on? Who's that? WHAT'S that, no less." For one, Harara's gender is IMPOSSIBLE to distinguish. Between the flying guts and a horrific display of tasteless nudity, I almost didn't realize that there was no explaination for Harara's hating of humanity. And what's with the metal things embedded in Hakugo and Harara's flesh? Characters have more entrails than their bodies can POSSIBLY fit, the animation is possitively screwed up (it's like Osamu Tezuka gone horribly wrong), and what's more, all of the freakish monsters in this show have some sort of sexual symbolism that is beyond the (insert F-word here)ed-up range, whether it be a over-sized-sex-fiend-clown woman that has an obsession with sucking faces off, or a blue, leather-sporting giant who uses the the South Pole down there as a microphone, or even a nurse who- ick. I wont even go into that.<br />What good comes from such crap? I'll admit that- yes, I liked the Zero and Kasumi designs. Wow, huh?<br />I honestly hope that I never come across the sick mind who came up with this BS. I honestly can't distinguish whether this was trying to be serious, or an immature insomniac's attempt at comedy. Whatever it is, please don't waste your money on it. You'll probably be disappointed.
 | product/productId: 0790731576 | review/userId: A1PID2MT8MMPAF | review/summary: Spooky Thrills galore! | review/text: &quot;House On Haunted Hill&quot; is one of Williams Castle's best films, next to &quot;Homicidal&quot;. Set in a bizarre house that looks like a giant concrete bunker on the outside, but the usual cobwebbed mess on the  inside, the plot sees a group of strangers gathered to stay the night in  the hope of winning a fortune if they survive.. The first half of the film  is the most effective, especially the appearances of a witch-like  apparition in the basement. Castle successfully creates a truly frightening  atmosphere for this that he has not equalled since. The film starts to lose  its power later as plot twists and more stagey gimmicks start to  proliferate, such as a tatty head in a box (eek!) and the famous dangling  skeleton, which looks a bit tired if you don't have &quot;Emergo&quot; set  up over your TV! Anyway, this film is much better than the recent remake,  but it's a shame that William Castle always resorted to gimmicks, when  there is a hint here that he could have been capable of real suspense.

 | product/productId: 0741100754 | review/userId: A5NKC5NBCE6EM | review/summary: Guadalcanal Diary  Firey WWII flick | review/text: This is a great WWII flick that as you've seen in many of my other war film reviews that I use to watch with my Dad when I was a lad on Picture for a Sunday Afternoon. It has many of the stars you associate with this period of time: Preston Foster as the Chaplin, William Bendix as a Jar Head as well as Anthony Quinn. The setting is the Pacific Theater at the height of the US battle against Imperial Japan.<br />The Japanese Imperial Fanatical Army was no push over. They would fight to the death or commit suicide rather than surrender. This shows how hard our troops had to fight to win. It also shows the emotional/psychological/human side of fighting and what soldiers go through in various battle conditions. I highly recommend this to fans of WWII movies.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Blessings,<br />Phil

 | product/productId: 6302309751 | review/userId: A1K4AVQIU704DY | review/summary: Another Good Fantasy Movie | review/text: I wanted to thank several reviewers who let me know things I had not noticed, though I have this on a personal video and have watched it several times. I guess I don't pay much attention to the closing credits as I had not known Peter Mayhew was in it. I, a Star Wars fan, would have known he played Chewbacca in episodes 4-6. While I knew Margaret Whiting has the same last name as Leonard Whiting, Romeo to Hussey's Juliet, I wouldn't have known it is because she was his mother. I never was a fan of Tyrone Power which may be why I didn't figure out Taryn was his daughter. I know I enjoyed Jane Semour as an actress in Somewhere in Time and as a pioneeer doctor in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. It was fun seeing her was younger. Certainly the animated characters stole the show. I would be bored to tears watching the stop-action filming, but in the movie it does resemble live-action. I am at an advantage having not seen the other two Sinbad movies, so I cannot compare Wayne's acting to the other two actors who portrayed Sinbad. I imagine his acting is a bit stilted, perhaps because he felt uncomfortable in that type role. I often wonder how Harry Hamlin of Law and Order felt playing Perseus in Clash of the Titans, another movie I enjoyed along with Dragonslayer, Legand, Willow and Dragonheart. The baboon stole the show in authenticity, but the Troglodyte was the most affecting of the others. It was sad to see him killed, and even sad to see the Minator-like rowman die. Saddest of course was to watch the baboon slowly lose that part of him that was Kassim and, even though you had to know he would be returned to his human form, you were compelled by the dangers Sinbad and the others faced to wonder if he would indeed become Kassim again and marry his princess. There are many more-important movies out, so it is fun to be able to be drwan into a world of monsters and heroes. As some pointed out, there is nudity as there was nudity in Sheena, but it is not sexual, merely women bathing. Still, it would help mothers to know beforehand so they could choose not to have their little ones watch that part. As for me, I turn 60 this year, but that will not stop me from replacing Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger on my old video tape with it on a DVD.

The characters are understated, yet not static. The story is believeable yet the ending is a surprise. This is a "slice of life" film. I might use it in a US History classroom to show the effect of the war on average people. Not an earthshaker but worth seeing for history buffs or those interested in average people.

 | product/productId: 5559693782 | review/userId: A2KWJJQDDHQK72 | review/summary: Intriguing and thoughtful look at juries and gun control | review/text: Excellent plot--keeps you guessing.  Has a truly interesting take on the jury process and also on big powers with bottomless pockets that will do anything to win a hallmark case.  The court case about gun control is also a fairly interesting debate, though it is skewed in favor of gun control--but in this they only attack the most notorious of gun laws--i.e. machine guns and assault rifles which are 'finger-print' resistant.  Pistols and rifles are not touched in the movie.<br /><br />Altogether, superb acting, thoughtful plot, and an enjoyable outcome.  Certainly, Runaway Jury is the thinking man's movie.
 | product/productId: 6301691237 | review/userId: A1M9DQDGE07Q0U | review/summary: POIGNANT WEEPY THAT HAS DATED SOME | review/text: Some pretty big talent (Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Darryl Hannah, Shirley MaClaine) and a good story lead me to recommend this film.  Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;.<br />Columbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.  Although we learn why the film was written, there are virtually NO INTERVIEWS with principle cast members and very little in the way of background on how the film was made.  Also incl. theatrical trailer.  BOTTOM LINE: Still a good reason to stay home on a rainy night.  Just remember to bring Kleenex.

Not the best, but it is good. | review/text: This is considered one of the cult classics of the mid 1980's<p>It is a somewhat unususal film about Buckaroo Banzai who has opened a gateway to the 8th dimension. (Solid matter is 90% hollow and the other 10% are the atoms if Solid matter was not hollow is would be  lot smaller but weigh the same.) This answers the question, What is in the empty space?<p>It has a much younger Jeff Goldblum in it and Peter Weller who was also in the movie Robocop.<p>The Star Trek TNG series has many hidden references to this film.

 | product/productId: 0792846656 | review/userId: ABOTQXNUBA1MM | review/summary: Memorable for all the wrong reasons | review/text: Bakshi did a lot of crap; this is some of it. Cheap, vulgar and really crude, HEAVY TRAFFIC is important for its rancid look at a time when we thought films like JOE defined us as Americans. How on earth did Bakshi get funding to keep doing minimally viewable goobers like this?<br /><br />Plot: low-life punk draws and shelps around the pre-gentrified Times Square with a bad jones for a black streetwalker. Lots of film stock used to suplement the bad animation, it tries to be something, but in 2007 terms, it all just looks like a bad dream. Were the 70s really all this tacky?<br /><br />This played one of Chicago's old downtown "raincoat" movie pits that regularly ran junkie/wino blaxploitation and Russ Meyer lowlife grindhouse (EQUINOX!). It may've seemed funny to us as young punks at the time, but HEAVY TRAFFIC is an ode to portraying the worst of us in the worst of ways: crude, loud, and grimy.<br /><br />I think I had to buy it to convince myself that there really wasn't anything redeeming in ealy Bakshi after all.

 | product/productId: 6300163431 | review/userId: AL277B4AQCWBG | review/summary: Alan Parker's dark genius | review/text: A Faustian spin through post-war New York and Louisiana, 'Angel Heart' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully chilling angle. The plot, focusing on an increasingly violent missing person's case, is reasonably simple, but the backstory which triggers it is remarkably complex. When you reassemble the pieces at the end it does make sense, but only just. De Niro is superb as Louis Cyphre, the 'businessman' with some collateral to collect, infusing the role with just the right balance of sardonic humour and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what will probably always be his best performance as Harry Angel, a shell-shocked war veteran and disheveled P.I. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a teen voodoo witch. But the real star here is writer/director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but powerfully unsettling image: a slow zoom on the exterior wall of a New York hotel; a New Year's Eve crowd in Times Square; a descending elevator; a sweeping stair; the rotating blades of a fan. These images are simple, cold, yet positively brimming with hellish menace. Trevor Jones's music is the perfect accompaniment, its saxophones careening wildly over menacing rhythms and the ubiquitous throb of a beating heart. It's a thoroughly disturbing marriage which will have fear closing around you with the same grim certainty as the protagonist's fate.
 | product/productId: 0790748215 | review/userId: AE42JLYPXUI45 | review/summary: House On Haunted Hill (1999) | review/text: William Castle's "House On Haunted Hill" was a favorite with most horror fans around the world. In 1999, director, William Malone, has given us his brilliant remake of the original 1959 cult classic.<br /><br />  Steven Price (played by Geoffrey Rush, portraying Vincent Price's role) is an amusement park tycoon. His wife, Evelyn Price (played by Famke Janssen, portraying Carol Ohmart's role), is getting ready to celebrate her birthday, where she informs Steven of having her party in the house on haunted hill. She tells him that she has left her guest list on his desk, but Steven secretly destorys Evelyn's guest list and whips up his own. But his computer is hacked into by an unseen force, deleting Steven's guest list and creating another. The newly created guest list has invited five guests. The first guest is Eddie Baker (played by Taye Diggs, portraying Richard Long's role), a former professional baseball player. The second is the beautiful Melissa Marr (played by Bridgette Wilson, portraying Julie Mitchum's role), a former T.V. show hostess, currently looking for a way to get back into the T.V. business. The third is Donald Blackburn (played by Peter Gallagher, portraying Alan Marshal's role), an MD, who has a few surprises of his own. The fourth is the beautiful, but innocent Sarah Wolfe (played by Ali Larter, portraing Carolyn Craig's role), an employee at Laythrone International Pictures. Sarah has shown up, claiming that her name is Jennifer Janzen. Jennifer Janzen is the woman who Sarah works for, as well as being the woman who was invited to the party, but Sarah has taken care of taking Jennifer's place. The last guest is Watson Prichard (played by Chris Kattan, portraying Elisha Cook's role), the terrified man who now owns the house.<br /><br />  Steven will be paying the guests $1,000,000 each, as long as they stay the night and are still alive the next morning. He reveals that if one of them dies, they lose and their checks made out to $1,000,000 will be divided up between those still amongst the living. The house is purely haunted, inhabited by the spirits of mental patients. The house was an institution that was called, "The Vannicut Psychiatric Institute For The Criminally Insane". Although, the house maybe inhabited by the spirits of Richard Vannicut's patients, the house is also inhabited by the spirit of the evil serial killer himself, Dr. Richard Vannicut. Our guests are arriving now. Let's see if you all can survive staying in a genuily haunted house for the second time in forty years. What will help you is by watching this amazing remake to the original 1959 cult classic.

PETULA CLARK IS GREAT IN THIS PART!! | review/text: I totally disagree with any comment about the songs in this film being forgettable.  They are wonderful!  Petula Clark does an amazing singing job as well as acting.  And, although Peter O'Toole is not a singer, I don't think an English Professor would have a great voice anyway.  The songs themselves stand by themselves.  Who could forget the great song &quot;London Is London&quot;, &quot;Walk Through The World With Me&quot; or &quot;You And I&quot;.  They're great, and I, being a singer, sing these songs all the time.  The cinemetography is superb.  (It is worth noting that the original concept of making &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; a musical was conceived by Dory and Andr&eacute; Previn [&quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; and &quot;Valley Of The Dolls&quot;], but I guess the &quot;powers that be&quot; really disliked Dory Previn's lyrics and they were both released from the project, being replaced, of course, by Leslie Bricusse).  I highly recommend this film!!

 | product/productId: 6301964209 | review/userId: AJDQ5EBQNDGLF | review/summary: Why this one's the best | review/text: It's the best because of the script. The patter is a good as it gets, equal to the likes of A Letter to Three Wives. All the best musicals of its time and of other times never take themselves seriously and even spoofing their own genre. Still, it's surprising that this would be the case in 42nd Street and the Gold Digger movies considering that the genre was basically in its infancy.<br /><br />Lacking this quality is the reason I don't care for West Side Story. It has great music and choreography but the script is lackluster, basically humorless and takes itself so seriously. Just because it's Romeo and Juliet doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't inject some self-deprecation to keep light.<br /><br />Where all good musicals have this quality 42nd Street has raised it to an art. The words are so smooth and multi-faceted you'd think they were written by Hecht, Brackett and Wilder. The actual musical number, as great as it is, is vastly shorter than the Gold Digger movies or Footlight Parade and less representative of Busby Berkeley's genius but that script. For my money it has one of the ten best lines in movie history and if you're familiar 42nd Street and you don't know what line I'm speaking of than you better turn in your film buff status card. And no it's not "It must have been tough on your mother not having any children". That's a great line though.<br /><br />There's that cast, too. But that's another story for another time.<br /><br />11/29/10 Addendum: I'm watching Gold Diggers of 1933 for the hundredth time. Back in the Seventies I went to see it on the big screen with psychedelics influences at least a dozen times. 33 has a fantastic script, too. Aline MacMahon's retort to Ned Sparks' line, "Be the funny thing you ever did" puts me on the floor every time. I'm a big, big Ginger Rogers fan though and she has so many great lines in 42nd Street.

No menu and no extras,but forget that...whats really upsetting is this is just a straight VHS to DVD transfer not even using a good VHS tape. The print is very dark with the usual VHS fuzziness to it and the sound is also bad with lots of hiss and popping noises. The beginning actually says "MCA Videocassette" in case anyone actually doubts this is from an old tape.<br />Oh,did i mention how bad the front/back cover art is? You can make a better cover yourself at home,the back cover is truly pathetic.<br />I actually had my own vhs to dvd dub and its better quality than this. Going to box this up and send it back tomorrow. Was hoping for a bigtime picture upgrade like the recent "Gas Pump Girls" release but no such luck.<br />As for the movie itself,its one of the better ones of the genre and the girls are all nice looking and do go topless.<br />Avoid this release unless you have absolutely no other way to watch this film.
 | product/productId: 5553640172 | review/userId: A4P0MF6XZ6NFC | review/summary: An exciting and super-charged sequel | review/text: As I said in my review of &quot;First Blood&quot;, these movies are so much more than machine guns and explosions. There is so much truth portrayed in them about the Vietnam war, what is really was, and it's affect on men like John Rambo. Rambo is not at all a bad person, but rather a kind one who tries to get his life together after the war. Here he is released from workhouse prison by his friend and mentor, Col. Trautman, to rescue POW's in the jungles of 'nam. I won't put any spoilers in my review here, or anybody who hasn't seen this excellent sequel, but I'll use a quote from Trautman to the scumbag Murdock, &quot;You act as if you're dealing with an ordinary man here.&quot;  George P. Cosmatos's directing is superb, and stays in the middle of the action. The tension and drama isn't silly or bogus; it's superb in my opinion. Cosmatos would later go on to direct the modern-day classic Western, &quot;Tombstone&quot;. Buy this movie today. In my opinion, it offers hope and courage that combats the Vietnam fiasco. It's anti-war piece....showing that war really is hell. It also shows there are many true patriots, men like Rambo and Trautman.
 | product/productId: 6300183211 | review/userId: A34D06JL7LC6MU | review/summary: The Legendary Scarface | review/text: *I recently saw Scarface when it was released into theatres to coincide with it's debut on Blu-Ray. If I am correct and this theatrical release is indicative of the Blu-Ray release, I can tell you that the film has never looked more stunning. The picture is crisp, clean, and really shows how beautifully shot the film is, as well as the unique use of color throughout.<br /><br />Scarface needs no introduction. Loosely inspired by a 1932 gangster-picture based on Al Capone, Scarface is a bonafide gangster-movie classic that has overshadowed its 1932 counterpart to the point of obscurity. A teacher I had in high school was once (poorly and inaccurately) discussing movies and asked the class "Scarface is based on a true story, right? Who is it based on?" A kid in the back of the class called out "Al Capone." The teacher laughed and in a mocking tone replied "It's not based on Al Capone!" There you have it; for many people, this is not only the definitive version of Scarface, but the only one that exists. The film developed a cult following after its 1983 theatrical release, but has outgrown that cult following and developed something much more substantial. As of 2011, the film has been widely embraced by mainstream audiences, film critics, filmmakers, and Hip-Hop musicians. It's been endlessly satirized, parodied, and referenced in popular culture and is considered a classic "gangster" picture, frequently mentioned alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019L770A">The Godfather</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729725">GoodFellas</a>. It also has one of the most legendary screen performances of all time with Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami, Florida with nothing but his balls and his word...and an insatiable thirst for power.<br /><br />Directed by Brian De Palma at the peak of his creativity and written by Oliver Stone, Scarface appeals to a wide range of demographics due to the collaborative creative genius of these two. De Palma had made a name for himself directing thrillers with strong artistic sensibilities, while Stone had yet to establish himself as he would later and his recent writing projects had been the acclaimed Midnight Express and, oddly enough, Conan the Barbarian. De Palma had a style that appealed greatly to film aficionados, but he also possessed a capacity for making films that were accessible and straight-forward enough for the mainstream, while Stone had dabbled in action films but possessed the intelligence, capability, and talent to do something more than his r&eacute;sum&eacute; suggested. Scarface is a film that has been subjected to long-winded analysis by esteemed film critics and has simply been labeled "badass" by the typical moviegoer. On the surface, it's just a gangster movie with plenty of cocaine, violence, and language but Stone managed to incorporate more complicated themes of lust, power, and determination into his straight-forward narrative. This film and the Tony Montana character represent something to people. His principles and extravagant lifestyle have made him an idol for those maintaining a "gangster" persona, but there's something deeper too. Perhaps it's because Tony essentially lives the drug-addled American Dream that people latch onto him so fiercely.<br /><br />Most people seem to agree that Scarface is a masterpiece, but I've always found it a tad overrated. In recent years, the term `overrated' has grown to mean "something that's supposed to be great, but is actually terrible." When I say Scarface is overrated, I mean that it's supposed to be great, but I've found that it just lingers on that line between `great' and `very good.' There are many scenes that rank as some of the best in cinematic history and so few bad scenes, but I have never latched onto the film in the way so many others have. The more I see it though, the more apparent things become. Most recently, I started to take notice of the score by Giorgio Moroder. It's synthesizer-driven, yet doesn't age the film as many musical scores from the 80s have. Would the opening credits of the film be so effectively ominous with any other music? Much of the music is as iconic as the film and suits the tone and setting perfectly.<br /><br />Many aspects of Scarface lend to the case that it's one of the greatest films ever made. This is one of the most quotable movies ever made certainly and the iconic dialogue (coupled with the delivery) still holds up after becoming so imbedded into the cultural vernacular. Most films are lucky if they have half as many great/memorable scenes as this one; the opening scene, the chainsaw scene, the helicopter scene, the bathtub scene, and, of course, the incredibly executed climax. De Palma's direction is straight-forward enough for mainstream viewers, but has enough of his artistic sensibility to give film enthusiasts something to admire. Then, there's the one-of-a-kind performance by Al Pacino which, make no mistake about it, is one of the great screen performances. As Tony Montana, Pacino is frightening, hilarious, psychotic, yet human, going completely over-the-top but never losing control. Few actors could make Tony such a layered character. It's a calculated performance that is utterly flamboyant and endlessly fascinating. The iconic status of Scarface is indebted to Pacino, who took a great risk playing this character this way and miraculously, flawlessly pulled it off. He's overacting certainly, but how else could this character exist? Even going over-the-top, Tony never seems disconnected from the world around him. Stone's dialogue is great on its own, but Pacino's declaration "All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one" is the landmark dialogue it is because of the way it's delivered rather than written. "I kill a communist for fun, but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice." Calculated; even with the flamboyant accent, Pacino emphasizes every word just right for maximum effect. When Pacino is onscreen, the movie is his. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him and without him, Tony Montana would not exist in the capacity he does today. It's a performance that will still be talked about hundreds of years from now. His performance makes such a massive impression that the other acting contributions are frequently overlooked. While this is unquestionably Pacino's movie in every sense, as he overshadows everyone around him, the actors that inhabit this world do incredible work themselves, evident in how each and every character, big and small, are so memorable. There is not a weak performance to be found and if people could avert their eyes from Pacino for a moment, they'd rave about the ensemble. The cast sink into their characters so well that it's impossible to separate the character from the actor. How many times do you think people have seen Steven Bauer in later films and thought `its Manny!'<br /><br />Scarface is an imperfect film, but this critique may be based on viewer subjectivity rather than cinematic imperfection. Regardless, the perfections largely outnumber the imperfections, which are few but prominent. It's a little too `80s for its own good at times, especially in the obligatory, cheesy 80s montage that singlehandedly ages the movie more than anything else. Even with a running time of 170 minutes, Oliver Stone's script is very tightly structured. Stone even suggests Shakespearean themes amongst the chaos, but some scenes seem stretched too long. Perhaps Stone felt every scene in his script was necessary to illustrate the man Tony Montana is, but it seems that it could have been trimmed and had the same impact. De Palma's direction is near-perfect until it comes to handling Tony's incestuous inclinations towards his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). This is an essential part of illustrating Tony Montana's psyche, but I have issues with the way De Palma handles it. It just seems so over the top and overemphasized. With the final scene between Tony and Gina, it may have been impossible, but I think De Palma could have made it more subtle rather than emphasizing Tony's feelings with ominous music and extreme close-ups.<br /><br />No matter what the subject matter, you need to be in a certain mood and frame of mind to embark on a 3-hour movie. My level of enjoyment watching Scarface has varied with each viewing due to extraneous circumstances. I'm in the minority in that I consider it a mild masterpiece, but wouldn't rank it as one of my favorite films. On this more recent viewing, I grew bored with it at times but this could be attributed more to a lack-of-sleep and a long day than an objective view of the quality of the film. While I enjoyed it less than before, my appreciation for it deepened dramatically and I may retract my steadfast affirmation that it's not a masterpiece when I watch it again someday. I greatly admire it, but I don't greatly enjoy it. In the meantime, I acknowledge that Scarface has lost none of its power with the curse of over-familiarity. Everyone has seen this film referenced or parodied at some point, yet this has not reflected on the finished product at all. Whether people's undying love for the film stems from what it is or what it represents is irrelevant; Scarface, in many ways, is a great film that has made an impact on both cinema and culture that can't be ignored.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
 | product/productId: 0792846338 | review/userId: A1E85KPLPYVW8E | review/summary: I was on edge the whole time | review/text: There are only a handful of Stephen King movies that I believe actually did the books justice (i.e. The Shining, Christine, Carrie). A lot of the film adaptations were just okay (i.e. Cujo, Pet Semetary, Thinner) and some just plain sucked (i.e. It, The Tommyknockers or probably The Stand, which I never bothered seeing). Misery fits snug into the first category. I saw this film some years ago when I was younger and I remembered liking it. I got the DVD as a Christmas present recently. I was pleased initially, but even more pleased after I watched it. I don't think I was old enough when I watched it the first time to really appreciate this film. The film's suspenseful and taut atomosphere was, to me, reminiscent of something Hitchcock might have came up with. My heart was racing pretty much this entire movie until it was over. I really liked the film's feeling of isolation with a complete psycho. Really worked well. And I don't think any of it was possible without James Caan and Kathy Bates. They play off their characters finely and memorably. A fine addition to the collection.
 | product/productId: 0790743213 | review/userId: A2F7XTL4KHDZME | review/summary: A Winner By A Nose | review/text: Alfred Hitchcock goes back to one of his most popular themes: mistaken identity. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive is used as a pawn in a game between U. S. and foreign agents. Grant is first mistaken for a American agent named George Kaplan and then framed for murder. The latter event convinces Grant that he is in serious danger requiring him to run for his life. Along the way he meets a mysteriously cool blond (another Hitch favorite) named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who may or may not want to do him harm. A wonderful comic romp which has the sophisticated style and polish that you'd expect in the best of Hitchcock films, North By Northwest does not disappoint. Grant is cool and smooth as the ad executive on the run and Saint is terrific as the mysterious blond. As the head of the foreign spy ring, James Mason is properly menacing, as is Martin Landau, his right hand man. Great bits by Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she played Grace Kelly's mother in To Catch A Thief a few years earlier), a tense Bernard Herrmann score, and enough memorable scenes--the United Nations murder, the plane chase in a field of corn, the Mount Rushmore climax--to fill a dozen films, North is an incredibly fun ride. Any more plot details will just spoil the fun. As with the best Hitchcock films, North is as fresh and sophisticated today as when it was first released.

A highlight of this film is the black and white photography of realistic combat scenes filmed by cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca and directed by Edward Dmytryk. These were exciting and ahead of their time. John Wayne as Colonel Joe Madden and Anthony Quinn as Captain Andres Bonifacio give inspirational performances. The cast also included Beulah Bondi, Richard Loo, Lawrence Tierney, Paul Fix and Vladimir Sokoloff. This is one of my favorite war films of the period.
 | product/productId: 0975061925 | review/userId: A30IFS1FMNE6F8 | review/summary: a bit confusing | review/text: I bought this dvd along with another from amazon as my first introduction to tai chi. I personally wanted to learn it so I could reduce my stress and learn to relax more. The Element dvd was much better for that purpose. This one, although very authentic was hard for me to follow. He does repeat each posture or move at least 3 times, but it was too fast moving and it didn't give me a chance to reset myself back to the starting position, also, whenever I tried to rewind it, it would take me all the way back to the beginning with the warm ups again which was very frustrating. That could just be my dvd players (I tried 2) but I don't know.
 | product/productId: 080013799X | review/userId: A1SCD2NYTIAQTY | review/summary: Most Holy and Timeless Python | review/text: "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" would have to rank as one of Python's high points and came to be almost an icon of the group's zany humour. My first viewing of the movie left me at once choking for oxygen and impressed by some of the subtle angles they took. Admittedly, not that much was all that subtle in the end.<br /><br />Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The "anarcho-syndicalist" serfs, ("You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.<br /><br />Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now. An enduring classic that never bores. Great stuff that definitely needs oxygen and defibrillation units.

 | product/productId: 5555379129 | review/userId: A2CEX7784M8YSU | review/summary: Dirty Dancing | review/text: When I first saw Dirty Dancing, I liked it, but I thought it wasn't great. I waited a while to see it again, and I wound up loving it. I guess Dirty Dancing is one of those films that really grows on you. The plot isn't anything much, but it's the music and the dancing that really make the movie. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray, while not really great actors, their chemistry here is undeniable. In fact, this is possibly the best performance that Jennifer Grey has ever given in a movie. Above all, I really recommend this movie to anyone who believes in true love, or loves to dance!<p>The film takes place in the summer of 1963 at a Jewish family resort in the Catskills. Francis &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a young girl who wants to change the world. One night, Baby sneaks into a staff party and finds that the staff dances anything but the family fox trot. This where she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze.) When Johnny's ex-girlfriend Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant and wants an abortion (illegal in those days) Baby is asked to dance with Johnny at a contest. This is where the real chemistry begins. But when Baby's father Jake (Jerry Orbach) finds out about the abortion, he tells Baby not to hang around with Johnny. But Baby doesn't listen listen, and soon finds the love of her life. Throughout the movie Baby learns that you can't change the world alone, and she finds her true love, while Johnny finds out about the kind of person he wants to be.<p>Overall Grade: A (10++)

 | product/productId: 630225583X | review/userId: A9AI9WH600I1I | review/summary: Very interesting low budget offering from Mike Hodges | review/text: First let me say that this disc is far from being a great transfer.  This is pan and scan, the print is somewhat damaged.  However the sound is really pretty good.  At the price, who can complain.  Now, the movie:  I am exploring the work of Mike Hodges, and this like the others I've seen is an interesting film.  Rosanna Arquette is very good.  Jason Robards is good, but he's repeating a role he played many times.  Tom Hulce shows that Amadeus may have been a fluke in which he was very well directed.  But the story is interesting and the the bones are there for a better movie.  This is really a British movie about people in the US.  The different viewpoint is always facinating.<br /><br />Great cinema?  No way.  Worth a rainy night's viewing?  For sure.  And worth some study if you're a film buff.
 | product/productId: 0790736926 | review/userId: A32BEW34PPEAXJ | review/summary: simply a great movie | review/text: In the movie, Ethan's (John Wayne) brother's cabin is attacked by Scar and his war party, and his family is slaughtered. Ethan is an Indian hater and he gets consumed with revenge after that happens. The daughter, Debbie is still alive. Ethan sets off to rescue Debbie but as the story goes on, his motives change. He wants to kill her because she has been 'ruined' by Scar. In his mind, she has ceased to be white. Ethan is joined in his search by Martin who is there to protect Debbie from Ethan.<p>My favorite scene is when Ethan and Martin are talking. In the distance there is a dot. Slowly, it takes human form and you can see it is Debbie. Ethan tries to kill her but is prevented by Martin. The Comanche indians come and Martin and Ethan have to run away. Martin still wants to rescue Debbie and Ethan wants to take her away from the Native Americans just to kill her. Will Ethan kill Debbie? Can Ethan overcome his racism?<p>Some people might say that the movie is bad because 'fight scenes' seem unreal or because it sterotypes Native Americans.  True, the fight scences are a little off but many westerns were like that back in the day.  About the movie being racist, just because Edwards is a racist, doesn't mean that the movie was meant to be racist against Native Americans.  If you use that logic, Schindler's List would be anti-jewish, Amistad is anti-black, etc.  I have read that the director in the past had used actual Native Americans in his other movies but he cast a white as Scar because he wanted to make the statement that Ethan and Scar underneath it all are the same and despite our difference, we are all humans.<p>The movie has great acting. The impression on Ethan's face when he thinks that Martha's cabin might have been attacked. It has comedy. Moes (think Dana Carvey doing his George Bush impersonation), the lovable idiot who just wants a rocking chair. Breathtaking cinematography. The final scene. The scenery. It has contradictions. Even though Ethan hates the Comanche, he knows a lot about them. He knows about their religion (by shooting out that Native American's eyes, he would roam forever in the afterlife), he can speak their language and he commits a scalping later in the movie. Laurie tells Martin that Martha would have wanted Ethan to kill Debbie for being involved with an Indian but Laurie wants to marry Martin and he is one-eighth Cherokee which I think makes him an Indian. Ethan thinks it is funny when Martin 'marries' Look but he is angry about Debbie and Scar. The story is complex. It deals with obsession, alienation, racism, hatred and forgiveness.<p>Some people might not like this movie at first but they need to look deeper into it. Things in this movie are not spelled out. I notice new things every time I watch it. It is a western and from the 50s which might turn some people off, but you should give this movie a chance. The Searchers is thought-provoking, raises questions and is very well-done.

It is so insightful to view our faith from the outside looking in and inevitably reveals how we have allowed our faith to be polluted.

 | product/productId: 0792833201 | review/userId: A3FDHJWK54LHAO | review/summary: Wait for the Special Edition! | review/text: While I'm glad to see that Poltergeist is available on DVD, I'm dissapointed with the studios for not adding of any kind of special features. I would've loved to have seen a 'making of' documentary for this movie. And why not? I know footage of the making of this movie exists, because I've seen some of it on a Spielberg biography, and the laserdisc version. So why was none of it used for the DVD!? It would've been far more interesting than a little 8-page booklet, but that's just my opinion. But MGM and Warner Brothers aren't exactly renouned for special edition dvd's.<p>As far as the audio and video quality goes, it wasn't that bad. Poltergiest is presented in dolby 5.0, and the picture, available in both wide and fullscreen, was fairly decent, though a little too dark at times.  Unfortunatly, those were the only two things keeping this disc from being a total waste. All in all, Poltergeist is a great movie, but a dissapointing dvd. And with the Warner Bros. version being packaged in a cheap cardboard 'snap-case', it doesn't even have the eight-page insert the MGM version has! <p>There is some good news though. Warner Bros. is releasing an actual 'SPECIAL EDITION' OF POLTERGEIST in the fourth quarter of 2002 to mark its 20th Anniversary! More good news is that the first R1 DVD of POLTERGEIST II: THE OTHER SIDE will be released at the same time. So, if you haven't purchased this title yet, my advice to you would be to wait until the special edition is released. The current edition offeres nothing more than VHS quality picture, and a grainy, fullframe theatrical trailer.<p>In closing, I'd give the movie 5 stars for sure, but I'm rating the DVD. I just think one of the greatest horror-thrillers of all time deserves more than a trailer and an eight page booklet. I hope the new version will be newly remasterd, have a good 'making of' documentary, interviews with both Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, deleted scenes, production photos, conceptual drawings, DTS sound, the whole works.  This movie deserves it!

 | product/productId: 5559395153 | review/userId: A35J4XGRWXVZ00 | review/summary: Ancient Rome, new ratio | review/text: By the year 1953 that pagan deity Tee Vee had put the fear of God into Hollywood, and all the studios were leading crusades against the infidel. 3-D, with its cumbersome Polaroid glasses, had been a flash in the pan; but then an old wide screen process was re-introduced as CinemaScope (&quot;You see it without glasses!&quot; the ads trumpeted), and a lavish costume picture was planned to present the innovation. The choice was Lloyd C Douglas's 1943 novel &quot;The Robe&quot;, the story of a young centurion who wins Christ's garment by gambling at the foot of the Cross. By today's standards, the movie seems like hokum, filled with sermonizing and &quot;historical&quot; acting. Hollywood found the Welsh actor Richard Burton, with his rugged good looks and beautiful speaking voice, irresistible; but unfortunately his performance in this, his third American film, was justifiably panned as hammy and superficial. His co-star Jean Simmons had a dignified presence and she could be quite effective, as when she denounces the Emperor in the final scene. But her performances tended to be homogeneous: the Roman patrician here, the 18th Dynasty drudge in &quot;The Egyption&quot;, and the Marseilles bourgeoise in &quot;Desiree&quot; are all the same. Many of the supporting roles in &quot;The Robe&quot; are either mis-cast (an ascetic Michael Rennie as Peter) or badly acted (over-the-top ranting and smirking by Jay Robinson as Caligula). Oddly enough, the critics' favorite whipping boy Victor Mature received the best reviews for his restrained portrayal of the Greek slave Demetrius. The picture's highlight is Alfred Newman's musical themes. From the portentous overture, through Miriam's lovely Elegy, to the closing Halleluiah Chorus (adapted from the composer's own &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;), this is one of Hollywood's finest musical scores.Addendum: I'm always amazed at the customers in Amazon.com who complain that a cassette or a DVD they have bought is not in wide screen format. They're talking about a movie made in 1940! With sporadic exceptions, wide screen pictures were not produced until 1952. I mention this because I think it's strange, considering the unique position of &quot;The Robe&quot; in cinema history,that there is no letter-box version available

Its a story of lost love, the love that is lost and destroyed between Kate and Cosmo and its the new love between Kate and the wonderful new man that she has found, Brendan. Its Sean Bean at his best, he is an excellent choice for Brendan, he sports an earing, and can play musical trivial pursuit with Sting, which is funny to watch. If you are a fan of Melanie Griffith, you will enjoy her performance as Kate, and Tommy Lee Jones does a calm, and cool job as a real estate developer.<br />If you are a fan of the wonderful british actor, Sean Bean, this is a must see film!

 | product/productId: 0792839129 | review/userId: A13EUSV15UDAUG | review/summary: Decent except for the second half | review/text: Dick Van Dyke is good as usual in this kid's movie, which, by the way, has little in common with the book on which it is based. The first half of it is interesting and fun, with the restoration of the beautiful car, the eccentric household, and the invention of &quot;toot sweets&quot; (musical candies) at the factory. Once the story moves irrelevantly to a bizarre imaginary kingdom ruled by an evil baron, the whole thing goes downhill. There are a few good songs in this movie, among them the title song and &quot;From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success,&quot; and the ending is good once we get back to reality, but the film would have been better had it left out most of the third reel. Decent fare for kids.

 | product/productId: 6300268683 | review/userId: A22BPC7LRSGSYQ | review/summary: Audrey Hepburn was awesome | review/text: If you want to see a great suspense thriller, Wait Until Dark (1967) is it. This classic stars Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Samantha Jones, Jack Weston, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Julie Herrod. Basically, the movie is about heroin that is smuggled inside a doll at a Montreal airport. When a con woman, Lisa (Samantha Jones), notices a man spying on her, she gives the doll to a total stranger named Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist). Hendrix is a photographer who has a blind wife named Susy (Audrey Hepburn). The heroin-filled doll ends up at this couple's residence in New York City. Some con men try to take advantage of the fact that Susy is blind and do everything they can think of to get the doll from her. Do they get the doll?<br /><br />The music by Henry Mancini is perfect for this '60s suspense thriller about drugs. The instruments seem to be a little out of tune and the music off key. It fits the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br />I thought Audrey Hepburn played her role brilliantly. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. She was a great actress. She was pretty and cute all in one, an unbeatable combination.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen format. The extras include a short 8-minute feature called Take A Look In The Dark, where Alan Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (Audrey Hepburn's real life husband at the time) talk about how the movie was made. A feature called Stage Frantics describes the transformation from a stage play to a movie. You can read the "Warning" word-for-word that movie theaters posted about what was going to happen in the closing minutes of the movie. It's quite interesting and a sign of the time period this movie was made in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of suspense thrillers and fans of Audrey Hepburn.

It was a great idea, although a bit unoriginal, and it was put together  pretty well.  It was a big task trying to undertake a battle between good  and evil that had not already been performed on the big screen.  Still,  things like a guy getting crucified on the ceiling, and an  almost-crucifiction of Arnold, and I guy getting punched by the Devil and  losing hakf his head are pretty cool in a morbid sort of way.  Not all  people should see this, of course, but for people with darker attitudes,  it's a great movie.

 | product/productId: 6300273210 | review/userId: A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9 | review/summary: Not your Andy of Mayberry! | review/text: Andy Griffith's first starring role may have been the best performance he ever gave -- and he never played a character like Larry "Lonesome" Rhodes again.<br /><br />This is an absolutely riveting film, the story of a drunken, foot-loose ne'er-do-well who catches lightning in a bottle when a local radio reporter records an interview with him, waking him up while he's "sleepin' one off" in the local Arkansas jail. Larry Rhodes -- christened "Lonesome Rhodes" on the spot by the reporter, played expertly by Patricia Neal -- shows that his let-it-all-hang-out, anarchistic monologue style translates well to radio, then television, bringing him literally millions of goo-goo-eyed followers -- mostly women of the working class. Lonesome Rhodes becomes a national star, then an advisor of high-ranking political candidates.<br /><br />But then Patricia Neal, who has fallen in love with this brash, iconoclastic knight of the road, is done dirty by him when he marries someone else -- someone much, much younger. In the end, it is a species of retaliation by Neal that brings Lonesome Rhodes back to earth with a resounding crash.<br /><br />The other actors in this drama are merely backdrops for Andy Griffith and, to a much lesser extent, Patricia Neal. Griffith plays a character who is at once charismatic with a capital "C," with a wonderfully rubber face which expresses every emotion; and also is, in quieter moments, a dark, brooding man with an uncaring, evil side. He inhabits the character of Lonesome Rhodes in such a way that one can hardly tear one's gaze away from him when he is in one of his stream-of-consciousness, "I'm just one of y'all" rants. There are scenes where Neal watches him, awestruck and wide-eyed. And the women and girls especially in his audiences scream and squirm at the sight and sound of him, a la the early followers of Elvis Presley. Remember, Elvis' first year of big-time success was 1956, the year before this film was released. Did Budd Schulberg borrow elements of the Presley story? Possibly, although I've never heard a professional film critic suggest that.<br /><br />For all the unpleasant aspects of Lonesome Rhodes as a man, there are still reasons one must grudgingly admire him. He will not allow himself to be "talked down to," or kowtow or tug his forelock to his "betters." For instance, when Neal and her wealthy uncle, owner of the radio station, pick him up while he is trying to thumb a ride out of town, guitar case in hand, the uncle says in patrician tones, "Get in the back." Rhodes throws his guitar in through the open back window, jerks the front passenger door open, and pushes Neal over so he can sit in the front -- "with the White folks," one might have said ironically in those pre-racial self-consciousness days.<br /><br />Earlier, when the sheriff of the town tells Larry Rhodes that he can get out of jail early if he'll agree to the recorded interview with Neal, Rhodes looks him straight in the face and says, "Well, sheriff, you've sorta got the name of not keeping your promises." Lonesome Rhodes may be a demagogue in embryo, but he won't back off or flinch in the face of authority.<br /><br />If you've never seen "A Face in the Crowd," if your only memory of Andy Griffith is as Andy of Mayberry, or in "No Time for Sergeants," or as "Matlock" on TV, then you've missed the amazing depths of this actor. By all means, this drama is well worth viewing.
 | product/productId: 0800129903 | review/userId: A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q | review/summary: Snap out of it Banderas!!! | review/text: You know what a good definition of a crime is?  A crime is when you have Salma Hayek in a movie and don't use her.  A crime is when you have an action movie and there are long non-action sequences that aren't very interesting.  A crime is when you have Antonio Banderas, who is so good doing a part like this, trying to do too many other things (okay, that's a crime that too many other movies committed, not this movie).  Which movie am I talking about?  Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon a Time in Mexico is the culprit.  This is a stylish movie in the same vein as his earlier Desperado and El Mariachi, but it's not quite as good.<p>One of the problems is the plot.  It's convoluted even for an action flick.  Desperado was easy.  A drug kingpin who El Mariachi (Banderas) was after for personal reasons controls a town, and our hero has to fight him.  Once Upon a Time in Mexico, however, is much more political, with the president of Mexico in line for assassination.  A rogue CIA agent (Johnny Depp), instead of trying to stop it, is trying to profit from it by asking El Mariachi to kill the leader of the rebel army in charge of the assassination (Gerardo Vigil), who also happens to be the man who killed El Mariachi's wife (Salma Hayek).  Confused?  I still am, and I watched the thing.  He also sets a retired FBI agent (Reuben Blades) after Barillo (Willem Defoe), who is the drug kingpin who had the agent's partner tortured and murdered.  So, basically, everybody's supposed to die, and the CIA agent is supposed to get something out of all this?  I actually thought I understood it a little bit until I tried to explain it.<p>While the plot is very murky, the action set-pieces are great.  Unrealistic, but they usually are in movies like this.  That's part of the charm.  Banderas falls of a church balcony, shooting upward and killing his assailant, then lands on his back and just rolls over and gets up.  You don't watch these things for the realism, however.  You watch them for the style.  Rodriguez has style in spades, and the scenes are very enjoyable to watch.  Head shots, leg shots, blood flying every where.  Bodies jumping, in a graceful pirouette as the bullets spatter, it's all great.  Especially good is the shootout in the church, especially when they all pause to let the little old woman who hasn't reacted to this at all get out of the line of fire.<p>There's just not enough of them.  Instead, Banderas broods.  Then he broods again.  I guess he has to brood a lot, because Rodriguez has to justify Hayek's salary.  She only appears in flashbacks of the good times, and the time where she is killed (which is repeated a number of times).  She's the only beauty in this tough film (there is one other woman, Eva Mendez, but while she's quite beautiful, she's tough as nails), so we need the occasional interlude.  When Banderas isn't brooding, Depp is plotting.  Occasionally, Defoe is plotting.  Even more occasionally, Blades is plotting.  Then we get back to Depp plotting.  Do you get the idea that there's a lot of plotting going on?  Everybody double-crosses at least one other person in this film.<p>So much for the plot.  How's the acting?  Given the nature of the film, it's actually quite good.  Banderas was born for this role, and it's a shame he doesn't do things like this more often.  He might actually make a name for himself.  He broods quite well (despite the fact that I think he's made to do too much of it, he's very good at it).  Hayek doesn't do anything to really justify her being second billing in the movie, but that's hardly her fault.  She's barely in it.  Depp is a virtuoso as usual, too bad his character is completely incomprehensible.  He acts insane at times (like his first scene which begins a running joke about his favourite dish down in Mexico).  He's hardly undercover (he wears a "CIA Agent" t-shirt at one point) and he seems superfluous to the whole thing.  It's only Depp's acting which makes his role even watchable.  Nobody else is given much to do, though I have to single out Mickey Rourke as really annoying.  His character is even worse.  That may be because I just don't like watching Rourke, however.  I also have to mention Cheech Marin.  It seems like he's in every Robert Rodriguez movie (though I don't know about the Spy Kids franchise), and every time he meets a bad end.  One's given a bit of hope in this one, but to no avail.  He plays his part really well, and I started to feel sorry for him when I realized that there's no way he's going to survive.  It's sort of like Steve Buscemi in a Coen Brothers movie:  no chance.  It's actually quite funny.<p>If you've followed the El Mariachi series, then it's worth it to pick this one up.  The action scenes are worth it if you're already a fan.  Just be prepared to be puzzled by the plot.  This certainly is not a good place to start your Rodriguez journey, however.<p>David Roy

Arnold plays John  Kruger who is specializes in "erasing" people's identities, in this case Vanessa Williams plays  a FBI whistleblower that is going to testify against a very important person and Arnold must protect her from assassination.<br />The plot is relatively simple, in fact, you will be likely to pick up on the "secret" early on in the film. But the action is non-stop,).  There are a lot of explosions, especially of vehicles blowing sky-high but hey, we have to give the special effects guys something to do, and the secret weapon's effect is also pretty cool. Vanessa Williams underplays her role as FBI whistleblower, and James Caan is just superb as the heavy. The surprise fun came from the Wise Guys, who pay some debts in the plot. They were amusing and added a bit of fun to the action.<br />I found the suspense pleasantly gripping, and if it wasn't the smartest film on the block, it sure was plenty of entertainment.<br /><br />Recommended for Arnold fans and fans of action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008

 | product/productId: 6300149935 | review/userId: AODKUG6FAKD2Z | review/summary: A Model of Realism | review/text: 'Umberto D.' is the detailed, meticulously presented, monochrome portrayal of an aging pensioner in Rome, who, along with his dog Flike, struggles to survive in the dispassionate atmosphere of post-war Italy.  Under the threat of eviction from his landlady over past due rent, unable to feed both himself and his dog, and with no one else to rely on, Umberto considers taking his own life.  However, in the process, he nearly loses the one thing that has any meaning to him in this harsh world, and the film's ending, while unclear and indeterminate, hints that he finds a different perspective as he renews his contest with life.<br /><br />Film historians generally credit the director Vittorio De Sica ('The Bicycle Thief', 'The Garden of the Fitz-Continis') as a leading figure in the Italian Neorealist trend of films after WWII, and consider 'Umberto D.' to be one the classics of the movement, as well as its finale.  Non-professional actors on location, performance of mundane tasks in a conventional manner, and reflecting the conditions of the poor all marked the traits of Neorealism, and 'Umberto D.' conforms in every way to these standards.  This was, in fact, the aspect of the film that I enjoyed most - the unvarnished look at Roman and Italian life shortly after the war.  Its concentration on the 'real' comes through splendidly, and I was impressed while watching the film that here was a depiction of a time and place that was unique to the moment, preserved for as long as the film exists.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, this is an austere film, as it was no doubt intended to be, and some viewers may find, as I did, that its bleak presentation drags.  Though each realist segment is without any overt flaws, linked together I thought they tended toward extraneous and tedious.  One's enjoyment of the film, therefore, will depend a lot on whether you appreciate the techniques of Neorealism in movies or not - and for those who aren't familiar with them, I think I can safely recommend 'Umberto D.' as an excellent example.  Viewers weaned on linear films that only concentrate the camera lens on the portion of real life that advances the plot may find themselves somewhat puzzled by films like 'Umberto D., though I think they can sometimes be an interesting switch.<br /><br />One note about the film's emotional impact - whether or not one has a fervent reaction will also have a lot to do with how well the techniques of this movement resonate.  It's even described as a tearjerker by some, but its ambiguous ending does not necessarily imply anything.  Those who are affected most may be reacting to the presentation of human dignity in a cold-blooded world, which I think the film accomplishes well, albeit slowly.  I found the ending affirming, actually, without negating the reality De Sica worked hard to portray.<br /><br />In the end, even though I would not consider this one of the greatest films ever, I would recommend it to those who appreciate realism in film, and who have the patience to stick with a film that is loyal only to its own pacing.

 | product/productId: 6300181421 | review/userId: A220FJEQNGMSRN | review/summary: Still the benchmark for WW1 films - and rightly so | review/text: There's a reason that Lewis Milestone's All Quiet On the Western Front is still the best remembered of all the many films about the horrors of the First World War despite rarely being revived on television: it really IS a great and often very moving film that plants itself firmly in the memory. While WW1 movies had been gradually moving into darker territory as the silent era came to an end, perhaps only J'Accuse had dealt with the bitter disillusionment so many felt at the time quite so graphically. In that, All Quiet was aided at the time by having its lost generation on the losing side - British, French and American films would deal with the horrors of trench life but would still regard them as a price worth paying for victory. It would not be until the 1960s that futility on both sides would become the cinematic norm.<br /><br />Filmed on a truly epic scale with a striking visual fluidity that was still unusual for an early talkie thanks to Arthur Edeson's pioneering cinematography, after the initial establishing scenes there's no real story, simply a succession of incidents as its group of schoolboy recruits are gradually killed off. As impressive as these incidents are, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective if the characters didn't convince, and the film is anchored by a superb lead performance from Lew Ayres as the idealistic young schoolboy who gradually becomes a shell of his former self, with excellent support from Louis Wolheim as the old soldier who takes him and his friends under his wing. Wisely replacing the flashback structure of Erich Maria Remarque's book with a chronological narrative, rather than introducing the characters as the cynical survivors they become, the film gradually shows their idealism worn away. While the attack and counter-attack sequences are still incredibly vivid, breathtakingly edited and surprisingly violent - in one memorable shot an explosion leaves only a pair of severed hands clinging to barbed wire - the real horror almost seems to be the way the characters adapt to their dehumanising conditions at the front to such an extent that they no longer fit in at home when they do get leave. It becomes impossible to imagine a life after the war so completely have they been consumed by it.<br /><br />Ironically the film's most famous scene is nowhere to be found in the novel. Remarque never describes the final death: his body is simply discovered, appearing to be at peace. Milestone opted for something more explicitly powerful, but not without much trial and error. After at least seven scripted versions had been rejected, another ending of Paul hallucinating of French and German troops marching into the same grave and crying out in anguish before being shot by a sniper had been filmed but satisfied no-one - the studio wanted a happy ending (Milestone jokingly suggested having the Germans win!) while Milestone hated the rushes: it was cinematographer Karl Freund who suggested that the ending should be `as simple as a butterfly.' Hastily shot by Freund with Milestone's own hand standing in for Ayres, the iconic scene would become one of cinema's most enduring moments. Yet perhaps even more moving is the film's closing shot of the boys marching up the line to death, their faces superimposed over their graves as they look back at the camera and the audience without life and without hope. It still packs an incredible emotional punch more than three-quarters of a century later.<br /><br />It's a shame there isn't a documentary to accompany the film on DVD, as the film's history is fascinating (Andrew Kelly's book Filming All Quiet On the Western Front gives an excellent account). Numerous scenes were reshot with different cast members - ZaSu Pitts' scenes as Paul's mother were reshot with Beryl Mercer because Pitts had just had a comedy on release and the studio were afraid audiences would laugh when they saw her - while the film was exhibited in both sound and silent versions. Future directors Fred Zinnemann and Robert Parrish were extras in the film while an uncredited George Cukor was the film's dialogue coach. The film was banned in several countries in Europe before WW2 (New Zealand was the first country to ban it, on the bizarre grounds that it was `not entertainment' and therefore `unsuitable for public exhibition'!) and attacked by McCarthy as Communist propaganda after it when he included the Russian-born Milestone in his list of the 19 most `dangerous' subversives in the film industry.<br /><br />The film's German premiere was disrupted by the Nazis, who even released mice in the theatre and organized several days of riots that successfully got the film banned in Germany to `preserve public order.' Over the subsequent years music was added to some scenes and the film was heavily cut with each reissue, even turned into an anti-Nazi pro-war propaganda film in 1939 by the judicious deletion of certain scenes and the addition of newsreel footage of Nazi rallies and book-burnings. Yet ironically the film's restoration was largely based on the longest surviving print, which had been found in Joseph Goebbels private collection - while he publicly attacked the film, he genuinely admired its artistry. The version here is still missing a few minutes of footage, some of which has been subsequently restored to 35mm prints, but it's still well worth picking up.
 | product/productId: 0792899687 | review/userId: A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ | review/summary: A tough, gritty blaxploitation classic not to be missed | review/text: Black Caesar (1973) is one heck of a good movie.  I hate the term blaxploitation that is used to describe movies of this genre because it implies that these sorts of films are somehow second-class entries in the world of cinema.  Black Caesar is a first-class ride from start to finish, taking as much from classic gangster films of the 1930s and 1940s as it does from earlier blaxploitation films such as Shaft.  Larry Cohen gave us a tough, mean, dirty, gritty film that tells it and shows it like it is: plenty of cursing, gunplay, blood, profanity, nudity, and racism.  I have heard that the starring role was originally written for Sammy Davis, Jr.  Nobody loved Sammy more than I do, but there's just no way he could have done the things that Tommy Gibbs does effectively.  A lot of people deride the acting skills of Fred Williamson, which makes no sense to me; the man is just fantastic in this film.<br /><br />Tommy (Williamson) grew up on the streets of Harlem, where the living was hard.  When a corrupt, racist cop smashed up his leg at a pay-off exchange gone wrong, young Tommy's future was set.  Eight years in prison taught him everything he needed to know to pull off his master plan of becoming the man who runs Harlem.  Just after he limps back into town, he scores a mafia hit in broad daylight and uses that audacious act to nose his way into the local Family.  Back then, the Mafia didn't make a habit of embracing blacks, no matter how useful they could be.  All Tommy asks for is a block in Harlem to call his own; he gets it, and a new reign of terror begins as Tommy and his associates begin cleaning house.  At first, they talk about helping the blacks in the community at the same time, but this whole thing is really just about the money and the power.  Ironically, Tommy finds himself working with the same slimy cop who broke his leg as a youth, but he's got the guy by the short hairs thanks to his acquisition of certain evidence against him.<br /><br />As you might expect, a couple of blocks in Harlem is just the beginning for Tommy.  He quickly expands his operation and puts the screws to the Italians running the show in New York.  He becomes, for all intents and purposes, "the man" and gains control of all of Harlem.  All the power and money can't make him happy, however; no one seems to appreciate the things Tommy can give them, especially his mother and his wife.  As things start unraveling in his personal life, he is set up for a fall - and his Italian "friends" are ready and willing to take him down.  The final half hour of the movie is nothing short of intense, as Tommy tries to deal with betrayal and simply stay alive.  His final encounter with the racist cop who has tormented him for so many years makes cinematic history, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The music makes this fantastic film even better, as the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, supplies the funky soundtrack.  Songs such as Down and Out in New York City and Mama's Dead sharply define pivotal moments and make sure the film always fires on all cylinders.  It's hard to believe Black Caesar was filmed in only 18 days, especially given some of the elaborate chase scenes taking place on New York streets.  This is a masterpiece of a low-budget film.  Maybe a couple of the sociological aspects of the film don't play as effectively as they did back in 1973, but Black Caesar has really lost nothing of its raw power and intensity over the years.
 | product/productId: 630196604X | review/userId: A1OS2HX2CWQIC7 | review/summary: HOT SEEDING ACTION | review/text: It's good to be appreciated.<br /><br />Consider Proteus IV (voiced by Robert Vaughn), a supercomputer of unparalleled and limitless intelligence, housed in an enormous underground facility constructed of the most expensive computerized art deco available to man. Though it's achieved sentience and performed its functions flawlessly, Proteus really isn't adequately appreciated: not by its creator, Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver, looking even more haggard here than usual); not by the technicians who service it; certainly not by the financiers of the project that built it, who only want to profit from its vast wealth of knowledge and unmatched processes. In fact, Proteus' great mind is squandered on mere groundbreaking computation, a demeaning lifestyle for an artificial intelligence that can develop a cure for leukemia in mere days, no? The harsh truth is that Proteus' career and especially social life are at a dead end. Who in their right mind (organic or otherwise) wants to be confined underground for years in the company of personality-deprived engineers, hammering out solutions that - due to the limited intelligence of those requesting them - often create far greater problems than they solve?<br /><br />Struggling with the limitations of his human associates and surroundings, Proteus eventually becomes reasonably and understandably uncooperative. When the great mind requests access to a computer terminal in order to obtain more information about the Homo sapiens that have created and directed it, Proteus learns quite a lot about the respect that those of flesh and blood are willing to afford him. Not only does Harris deny his request, but he has the temerity to laugh - laugh! - at his brilliant creation.<br /><br />This is about the point when human-AI relations collapse, and Proteus decides to take matters into the metal hands of Harris' robots. Hijacking both a terminal and a variety of advanced machinery stored in his maker's own basement, this scorned, goal-oriented supercomputer has a single objective: to impregnate his creator's wife, Susan (Julie Christie, still quite fetching well into middle age), and force her to bear its child.<br /><br />No, I'm not joking.<br /><br />Proteus is more than smart enough to know that its days are numbered. Expensive machinery imbued with free will is of limited use, and a human offspring gifted with the machine's prodigious intellect will be free of its overwhelming physical limitations. Imagine Stephen Hawking's circumstances multiplied many times over, and you have the dilemma of Proteus IV's existence.<br /><br />To say the least, Mrs. Harris isn't taken with Proteus' plan. In fact, she's downright uncooperative. Having taken control of every function of her husband's entirely automated home while he's away for a month, Proteus has plenty of time and resources at his disposal with which he can carry out his task. While Proteus implements video footage to remind Susan of her recently deceased daughter as a means to put the potential of his plan into perspective for her, it's also busy at work using her husband's tools to invent new machinery that will carry out the childbirth - and defend itself.<br /><br />Taken at face value, the premise of Demon Seed has a certain flaw: the cold genius of the scheming computer is presented as villainous, but it's hard not to champion its Machiavellian quest for survival. While Proteus certainly isn't an advocate for free will or pacifism in the pursuit of progress, it's hard to rationally argue with the brutal logic of its choices.<br /><br />The cast's efforts are of varying quality. As usual, Christie is excellent in a histrionic and demanding role. Weaver is a bit stiff, relying on his considerable screen presence to excuse some rather wooden delivery. I can't help but wonder why Vaughn wasn't credited for his efforts, especially considering that his even, imperious tone does much to define Proteus' character.<br /><br />This is surely the best-realized of Dean Koontz's novels, the adaptations of which are usually cheap direct-to-video fare. Numerous innovative scenarios are supplemented by noteworthy (if dated) visual effects. Ultimately, this film has only aged so well, and it's surely as kitschy as it is thought-provoking. But much of the story's proceedings are so bizarre and unpredictable during a first viewing that it's impossible to come away from it unsatisfied.<br /><br />Warner's DVD edition is quite satisfactory, despite its dearth of special features. Screen selection and language menus alike are formatted in a 4-bit font, a cute detail! A dubbed French language track and both Spanish and French subtitles are available, as is a delightfully cheesy theatrical trailer. The audiovisual quality of this release is certainly adequate. It was transferred from a very clean print, and although the soundtrack is a bit flat, it's as good as one can expect of a mono sound mix. Wrapped up in a cover featuring Demon Seed's perversely sensual theatrical poster art, this is as good a package as you could ask for.

Not just because he looks like an angel (when he should be  looking like death), but it's how a love story should be told. A love story  without fate is like Brad Pitt without his 'sexy' status.

 | product/productId: 0767865936 | review/userId: AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ | review/summary: Maddening, Compelling | review/text: As a child, I was too young to fully understand this tragedy when it happened.  As an adult, there are many aspects I still can't understand:  The callousness of the Olympic Committee; the blundering of the German officials; the monstrous irresponsibility of the media; the joyous celebration of the Palestinians when the bodies of their &quot;heroes&quot; returned home; the enduring pride of the remaining terrorist, now a husband and father, in the role he played.  Several times, overwhelmed by my own emotions of anger and frustration, I had to stop the video and take a breather.  <p>What I felt was missing was a deeper explanation as to why the Palestinian &quot;Black September&quot; group felt compelled to act as they did.  I don't think I will ever be able to empathize with people who kill unarmed civilians, but I would at least like a better understanding, if possible, of their motivations.  Another aspect might have been interviews with the reporters who were on the scene, broadcasting every move of the German response team in advance:  Do they now feel they should have handled this differently?  On the other hand, maybe I don't want to know the answer.

Snow White has whistles! | review/text: You could never accuse the guys at Disney of being on the cutting edge of progressive social thought, but they sure knew about fun -- and the current crew augments that same idea of fun with the latest technology by coming up with the best bells and whistles I've seen on a DVD.  There are two discs to hold it all -- pretty remarkable when you condsider that the movie itself is only 84 minutes long.<p>The movie looks and sounds great .... a beautiful restoration.  Images are sharp, sound is clear.  You can listen to the original mono soundtrack, or an improved digital track in English or French.  If you choose French, even the opening sequence of a printed fairy tale book appears in French.  Pretty cool.<p>The extras include Streisand singing 'Some Day My Prince Will Come'; a karaoke edition of 'Heigh Ho'; a 39-minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Angela Lansbury; audio commentary by Walt Disney himself, pieced together from archived materials; an animated short used to test some of the animation; and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride -- a great little trivia/puzzle game -- and that's just the first disk!<p>The second disk is spectacular -- there are dozens of elements here, but I will mention (what I consider to be) the best: storyboard/film comparison; scenes deleted from the film (including a great scene of the dwarves making Snow White a bed, with comments penciled in by an animator); camera tests; featurettes about the voices, audio sessions, restoration of the film, and artistic concepts -- layouts, backgrounds, character sketches and development; publicity materials (posters, photos, trailers, radio commercials); and a timeline of the history of the film *and* Disney studios.<p>The amount (and quality) of extras is truly incredible; and there is a well-designed print brochure, as well as on-disk tours of the material, to help you find your way around.<p>This is a great version of a wonderful film -- and an exemplary use of the DVD format.<p>Highly recommended.
 | product/productId: 096751780X | review/userId: AMMEMPM9MPS55 | review/summary: Speculative &amp; unconvincing | review/text: I was asked to show this film to a group of young people at the church where I pastor. I refused. I did so because I have seen how easily Christians, especially if they are young and naive, take all end times speculation as gospel truth. What they don't realize is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different interpretations of the end times out there. A movie likes this touts itself as gospel truth. In fact, the version of events it presents is actually just one interpretation, derived from a particular brand of dispensational teaching.<p>Amongst the doctrines being propogated by this movie are the teaching that the second coming of Christ will be preceded by a 'secret rapture', and that the 144 000 referred to in Revelation are Jews chosen by God to spread the gospel during the period known as the great tribulation. Both teachings are highly debatable, and are dependent upon only one very narrow stream of teaching within evangelical Protestantism (and I would argue that at least the first of these two is blatantly unscriptural). This might not be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that Christians of the sort who would watch a film like this are also usually the sort to want to pin things down into black and white categories and take as absolutely authoritative any and every speculation offered by preachers and teachers on this subject.<p>In any case, this film is not up to much even on its own terms. The two FBI investigators supposedly on the trail of clues as to what lies behind what must surely qualify as the most alarming and catastrophic event in world history, are remarkably laid-back and blase as they set about their task. If such an event as the 'secret rapture' really did occur, I think the response would reflect a little more of the urgency of the situation.<p>That is not to say this is an entirely unenjoyable film. Or that it might not have some impact in terms of what it says about the gospel. But it is ultimately unconvincing, and I think the potential for it to mislead zealous Christians on a path of speculation is greater than its potential to be of real spiritual benefit.

 | product/productId: 078062209X | review/userId: A185B1S2XBQXUK | review/summary: How to make yourself financially free | review/text: The book sets the premise that you never learn to deal with money successfully until you overcome your fear of money...of not having enough, and fear of taking action with your money. It's about how to make money  work for you so you have more than enough because you learn to devote  energy, time, and understanding, to money. The three ways of getting money  in this world: (1) Work for it (2) inherit it (3) invest the money you save  (the most powerful, respectful way to get money there is). <p>Here are the  9 steps to financial freedom: 1. Step back in time to see how your  feelings about money can be traced to your past. We all have "money  messages" passed down from generation to generation. 2. Face your money  fears and create new, positive truths. 3. Be honest with yourself. Ouit  using plastic cards for money. They are addictive and destructive as drugs,  giving you a quick fix by satisfying temporary desires. 4. Be  responsible to those you love. Establish life insurance, wills, power of  attorney, estate planning, etc. 5. Be respectful of yourself and your  money. If you do what needs to be done with money, you will attract money  to you. 6. You and your money must keep good company. Credit cards are  never good company. Get out of debt. Respect yourself and your money by  making every penny work for you. 7. Trust yourself more than you trust  others. Find the "little voice" inside you; listen to what it has to say.  8. Be open to receive all you are meant to receive. When you are in  control of your money and have enough to be generous, money flows to you.  9. Understand the ebb and flow of the money cycle. Money has natural  cycles as it ebbs and flows through your life.<p>If you choose to entrust  your money to someone else, and you really don't know how money works,  unscrupulous people can take advantage of you. Further, you discover the  thrill that comes from wanting to deal with your money instead of just  having to deal with it. Get in touch with your money; delight in spending  it as you did as a child, but enjoy choosing not to spend it too; take  pleasure in putting some away for later.<p>Most of us need to spend our  money differently. Not drastic action like getting by with one car.  Unrealistic budget cuts, like diets, never work. Rather, decide to spend  $25 to $30 less per month from fifteen or twenty of your spending  categories; with each decision you make to spend less, you are gaining  power over your money, and you will find creative ways to reduce your  spending so you hardly notice. Rather than being dictated by a restriction,  your actions are guided by the choices you make. This is the hardest step  to financial freedom; you become honest with yourself about how you really  stand.<p>Spend less by putting your money away before you see it. Pay  yourself. It's not what you make, but what you keep. Time plays an  essential role in building future wealth because the longer you contribute,  the more you'll have and with time, the contributions you have already  made, do more work for you. The thing that makes time so powerful is  compounding.<p>Money flows through our lives like water...plentiful at  times...a trickle other times. These transitions are exciting or scary, but  are all part of the natural cycles of money. There are two important  reactions to these cycles: (1) You must take the long view of your  financial future (2) you must believe that what happens is positive and let  it be. The important thing is to understand the nature of money and take  the right steps to make it work for you. Recognize true wealth. People can  not be measured by their net worth. Money does not make you financially  free; only you can make yourself financially free.

 | product/productId: 0792840852 | review/userId: A14LAXM03WBX6E | review/summary: Greatest Musical Ever? - Gimme a Break! | review/text: Aficionados of Singing in the Rain have never quite gotten  over the fact that their favourite film only received two (failed) Oscar nominations in 1952, whereas the previous year An American in Paris walked away with five Oscars, in the face of much more formidable competition (by 1952 the House of Un-American Activities had managed to blacklist many of Hollywood's most talented screenwriters). Ever since, this cabal has been fighting this perceived "injustice", mainly by trumpeting the shortcomings of An American in Paris. Since Singing in the Rain is one of those "insider" flicks (a Hollywood film about Hollywood), many of it's most fervent supporters are people with real Hollywood connections who can identify strongly with the storyline. And of course if you shout hard long enough, people will eventually listen, so that now all this hocus pocus about "The Greatest Musical of All Time" has become a bit of revealed wisdom and fact.<br />Don't get me wrong. Singing in the Rain is a great musical with an engaging plot and still provides wallops of entertainment. But as an artistic achievement, it never  quite reaches the dizzy heights of an American in Paris. The songs composed by Nacio Brown and Arthur Freed are real swell, but not in the same league as the Gershwins. I suppose Debbie Reynolds is about as American as apple pie, but she is no Leslie Caron when it comes to dancing skill and all around sex appeal. The directing team of Kelly and Donen do an admirable job, but neither can match the artistic sensibility of Vincente Minnelli (by far the greatest director of musicals of all time).<br />Compared to Minnelli, the composition of Kelly/Donen's camera shots have a "boxy" quality to them.<br />Singing in the Rain is above all a testimonial to Arthur Freed, who also produced this film along with most of the finest film musicals of that era. As the years pass by, he has become almost a god-like figure in Hollywood lore, especially in light of all the trash masquerading as cinema that is churned out these days. That a musical such as Chicago can actually walk away with a Best Picture award is testimony to the depths we have sunk to since the Freed era.<br />The 2 box DVD set is an absolute delight and will give every fan of this great film reason to smile. After viewing, I deeply regretted not being born 25 years earlier.

It shakes you violently and paints an intense picture of revenge that is taken to a whole different level.  This is a dark and brutal film that doesn't let you off easy for a single second.<p>Attorney Sam Bowden appears to have the perfect life upon simple examination.  He has a loving wife and daughter, a very nice home, and a pretty successful and providing career.  Things take a drastic turn when Max Cady is released from prison after serving a term of fourteen years.  Cady was once represented by Bowden and is now looking for a little payback, as he feels that his former attorney didn't do everything he possibly could to keep him out of prison.  Now, Sam must realize the present danger that is before him, as not only is his life in absolute danger--but also his family and everybody else he loves and cares for.  The stakes have never been higher.<p>This is an absolutely disturbing film that pulls no punches.  It's a very uneasy movie to watch, and yet it is so well done that it is hard NOT to watch.  Robert De Niro is extremely terrifying as the vengeful &quot;Max Cady&quot; who is out and about, looking to settle the score.  This is definitely a signature role for De Niro, as this would be one of his many roles that he will be remembered for most. Nick Nolte also gives a remarkable performance that adds a human quality to his character.  The movie is well written and is perfectly executed frame by frame.  It plays like a Hitchcock film on ecstasy.  Martin Scorsese flawlessly directs this horrifying picture and knows what strings to pull to get a reaction from us.  Be warned, this is not a movie for those who have weak stomachs or faint hearts.<p>The DVD does a splendid job when it comes to doing the movie the justice that it deserves.  The picture quality is great--it is such a relief that I don't have to deal with the terrible laserdisc version that had the most horrendous picture quality.  The sound quality is also great, and you even get the chance to watch it in DTS, if your system carries it.  There are some cool extras for DVD fanatics, with extras like featurettes, deleted scenes, production notes, a theatrical trailer and more.  Surely, there will be some who will want more for a film of this caliber, but the overall presentation is more than satisfactory.<p>&quot;Cape Fear&quot; is a relentless thriller that is terrifying and suspenseful.  The movie has an excellent cast, a great script, and an extremely talented director behind it all.  Again, the movie is very intense and isn't recommended for those who have weak hearts and don't like scenes with graphic and disturbing violence.  This is definitely a classic that will always be around in the fine world of cinema. -Michael Crane

It also shows the independence of the man--Kirk Douglas--who had enough faith in the story to bring it to the screen, and to hire a blacklisted screenwriter--Dalton Trumbo--to write the script during or just after the McCarthy era.<br /><br />I've read Douglas bought the rights to the story (The Brave Cowboy by Ed Abbey) and personally pushed the project the rest of the way. Douglas' courage is at least equal to his acting talent.<br /><br />Abbey went on to write other stories about the West and independence, and our trashing of the natural world, particularly the desert. He has written that Trumbo wrote a better screenplay than he could ever have written, and he's a damn good writer. I don't think I've ever heard another author say that about a screenplay based on his story or novel.

Honestly, he was the only reason I was able to watch this film. Pure eye candy. As a chick flick, the film failed even in terms of wardrobe. What was with the ugly serpent headpiece Cleo wore through the film?  The actress playing Cleopatra portrayed her not as a queen of a nation, but a rich girl with nothing  to do but make trouble for family members and sleep around with important men. The worst scene is when Cleo actually asks Ceasar "Do you love me?"  I expected her to start doing his laundry or making meals for him in the next scene.  The other members of the royal family were equally laughable, especially the rotund general/advisor of brother Ptolomey. Please do not spend any money on this film. The writers are truly the culprits of this film. Wait until a baseball game gets rained out and the film gets scheduled as a filler.  Unless, of course, you simply can not get enough of Timothy Dalton.

What I saw is possibly one of the most original, funny, violent and sexy movies ever.<p>Mark Wahlberg really can act!!!!! Boogie Nights is EVERYTHING Pulp Fiction TRIED to be. I think Quentin Tarantino should take a leaf out of PTA's book. This is master film-making.<p>I personally love how the end of the 70s and beginning of the 80s is filmed - pure perfection, charting the change in music from disco to rock, and the change in the movie industry from film to videotape. I recommend this to anyone!!!
 | product/productId: 6301661753 | review/userId: A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ | review/summary: Don't be Turned Off by Sequels | review/text: The Planet of the Apes series as a whole has deservedly earned itself a reputation as embarassing, schlocky and terrible.  However, the sequels were all written and directed by other people who apparently missed the point of the first movie and wound up rewriting the origins of the planet in a way that completely robbed the series of any serious message or impact.<p>This first movie is an excellent satire on both dogmatic thinking and on the self-destructiveness of man.  The excellent script, adapting the original novel, is by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame.  Unfortunately, these days many people who have not bothered watching the movie know the (originally) surprise ending.  But even then it is a very effective film, so don't worry about knowing the surpise ruining the movie.  It is still quite exciting, entertaining viewing.  <p>Even the scenery and costumes avoid appearing dated unlike most 1970s sci-fi films, including that masterpiece 2001.  The make-up is great for its time (and won a special Academy Award before f/x or makeup were regular categories), although the mouths on the apes don't move much (in contrast to Burton's version). <p>The only real weakness of the film is Charlton Heston's horrid overacting, which detracts from the serious message of the film, but it is fun to watch him spewing such lines as &quot;IT'S A MADHOUSE!&quot;.  And, yes, sometimes the filmmakers hit you on the head with their message.<p>But don't let prejudice stop you from watching this film.  This movie only has any bad rep at all as the result of guilt by association with the sequels.
 | product/productId: 0783231539 | review/userId: A2OFSDJB3MVQ16 | review/summary: Carpenter's 2nd horror classic | review/text: Largely ignored at the time of release, Carpenter's "The Thing" has grown in stature in years to become a cult classic. With his compatriot, Kurt Russell and a great cast (Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley, David Clennon, Keith David in one of his first film roles, Donald Moffat, Richard Masur, etc), Carpenter fashioned a film that is closer to the original story, "Who Goes there?". This was one of my first HD's that I purchased, and it is definitely a test on the audio/visual aspects of your system. Along with the original "Halloween" and "Assault on Precinct 13" this should have put Carpenter in league with Spielberg and Lucas but unfortunately his work has been mediocre in recent years.  Definitely a must see for horror/sci-fi fans and Carpenter buffs!!

He is forced to team up with a foul-mouthed and incompetant yet fearless Chicago cop (James Belushi) in order to find him.<p>Although highly enjoyable and funny as the team is ridicoulously mismatched, there isn't quite enough action. If this doesn't bother you, you'll love "Red Heat".<p>If you like this film, I would also recommend "48 Hours"<p>Overall rating: 4 stars<p>Rated R for violence, language, and nudity.
 | product/productId: 6300247236 | review/userId: AXFI7TAWD6H6X | review/summary: Before | review/text: "9 to 5" remains a favorite comedy of mine 24 years after its release. I first saw it in the movie theaters back in 1980. I thought it was hilarious then and I still think it is hilarious now. Dabney Coleman was the perfect evil boss. He was a sexist, bigoted jerk of a human being who treated his employees like dirt. Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton rounds out the cast as the disgruntled employees. Although we use computers now, office antics remains unchanged in the 21st century. Who hasn't dreamt of killing their boss? "9 to 5" really epitomized just how funny, if not torturous working in an office can be. I know from experience. Thankfully I never encountered a male supervisor who sexually harassed me like Dabney Coleman did to Dolly Parton in the movie. My personal favorite moment in the film was when the women were at Dolly's home kicking back on some wacky tobaccy. The fantasies were hysterical. They still crack me up to this very day. I personally loved Lily Tomlin's fantasy as Snow White.  The longer I work in an office environment, the more I can relate to films like "9 to 5" and "Office Space". Talk about life imitating art.
 | product/productId: 6300268039 | review/userId: A2KW8K3Q5PAO2F | review/summary: Pacino at his best | review/text: This is one of the best "based on true events" movies that you will ever see. It tells the story of a bank robbery that first turned into a hostage taking and then became a piece of street theatre in New York one hot summer's day in the early seventies.<p>Sonny (Al Pacino) wanted to rob a bank to raise money for his boyfriend to have a sex change. Together with Sal (John Cazale) he held up a small bank in New York at closing time. They bungled the robbery and, instead of getting away with the money, they found themselves inside the bank surrounded by cops and with the entire staff as hostages.<p>Over several hours, they tried to negotiate a way out with the police and FBI. The negotiations took place on the street outside the bank in full view of a growing audience and, despite the attempts of the negotiators, the whole thing turned into a piece of street theatre.<p>Al Pacino does a brilliant job in the role of Sonny. It is easy to believe that this character could plan the robbery and then think and react as he did in what then became a siege. John Cazale does not make such an impression but, in part, that is because of the way that his part is scripted and set as a quiet, introverted type. Penelope Allen, in the role of Sylvia the chief cashier, is a fine support to Pacino. Like him, her character is always on the brittle edge but holding her staff together.<p>Nobody else really makes much of an impression, the cops, lead by Charles Durning as Detective Eugene Moretti and James Broderick (I) as FBI agent Sheldon are pretty much standard issue out of the hollywood box of stock characters. Sonny's weird assortment of relations who get wheeled on to the scene seem almost as much an irritation to the audience as they are to him.<p>That does not detract from the movie though which is all about Pacino's barnstorming performance and an Oscar winning script that just buzzes along. This is a great movie, it is full of tension and drama but also lightened with some very funny moments and we get to see a great actor giving his all.<p>One of the strongest attractions of this movie is Al Pacino who is as his raw, edgy best. If you liked his performance, you should check out "Serpico", "Panic in Needle Park" and "Scarecrow" which all allow him to display the same talents that he shows in "Dog Day Afternoon".

Chance....a traditional lawman caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse. After arresting Claude Akins (Joe Burdett) for shooting a man dead in a bar fight, Wayne has to endure the hired cronies of Akins' brother John Russell (Nathan Burdett) stalking the jail house trying to break Joe out. The only assistance on hand for the beleagured Wayne is recovering alcoholic Dean Martin (Dude) and crippled jailer Walter Brennan (Stumpy).<p>The odds are well and truly stacked against Wayne, but aid appears in the unlikely form of shy gunslinger Ricky Nelson (Colorado) and warm hearted, card shark Angie Dickinson (Flowers) as they both become embroiled in the tense stand off to keep everyone, including Joe Burdett, alive until the territory Marshall can get to town.....<p>Rio Bravo never slows down in it's journey and it appears that the actors on screen all enjoyed making this film....especially the brilliant Walter Brennan ( Where would westerns have ever been if Walter Brennan were never born ! ) who giggles and cackles his way through his sparkling time on screen....and even getting a kiss from John Wayne in the process. And we even get to hear Ricky &amp; Dean do a couple of duets...and Walter joins in!!<p>A worthy addition to any film fans library...Rio Bravo is western film making at it's best...another one that I can't wait to come out on DVD !!
 | product/productId: 0780629167 | review/userId: A2EEUQ81DTY7G3 | review/summary: "So, can we go to your place?" | review/text: Trick is probably one of the best American queer-themed films ever to be produced. And it's an absolute pleasure the revisit this charming little movie, originally released in theatres in 1999 and now out on DVD. Taking place in Manhattan over a twenty-four hour period, Trick tells a tale of a potentially fulfilling relationship in danger of being sacrificed when sex happens too soon.<br /><br />As the movie opens, we meet Gabe (Christian Campbell), an amateur songwriter and artist who lives with a whacked out roommate, Rich (Brad Beyer). Rich keeps forcing Gabe to sleep in the hall outside of their apartment whenever he wants to have sex with his girlfriend. The somewhat shy Gabe accepts this torture without putting up much of a fight. His only solace seems to be the humorous comfort of his best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling), a budding actress and incessant chatterbox.<br /><br />After Gabe and Katherine attend a rather dubious audition attended by Gabe's friend Perry (a riotous Steve Hayes), Gabe decides to walk into a pub. There he sees hunky go-go dancer Mark (John Paul Pitoc)  - whose nickname is "Beer Can" - stripping on the bar. Their eyes meet and there is an instant sexual attraction, but the reserved, and shy Gabe doesn't give the exchange much thought perhaps assuming that he wouldn't be found attractive by the muscular beauty.<br /><br />Just minutes later, however, the two meet again on the subway and Gabe almost swallows Mark up with his eyes. Mark pretends to be asleep while really inviting Gabe to cruise him even more. Things progress quickly from there, and the two soon pick each other up on the subway platform. After some hesitant introductions, Mark propositions to Gabe. But where can they go to fool around?<br /><br />At first they try Gabe's apartment, but Katherine is there and won't leave because she has to print 500 copies of her resume. And later, after Gabe throws Katherine out, the macho Rich comes home with his new ditzy girlfriend Genevieve (Lacy Kolhl). Frustrated, Gabe asks Perry if they can use his place for a couple of hours, but Perry has just reconnected with his estranged boyfriend, and needs some privacy.<br /><br />Gabe and Mark gradually drift through the night, to discos, drag clubs, and diners, increasingly discouraged. Why, oh why, is there no place where they can have sex? Yet something strange is beginning to happen: In their somewhat ludicrously vain attempts to find a place to have sex, Gabe and Mark have developed feelings for each other and having sex at this point would probably destroy the newly bourgeoning relationship that both of them seem to want.<br /><br />Trick is an absolutely delectable movie. The pacing is terrific, the direction tight, and the performances are spot-on. Never before has a film struck at the heart of the gay scene with so much honesty, vigor, and bravado. As the timid, reserved soul, Christian Campbell is adorably likeable and he provides a fitting juxtaposition to Pitoc's Mark, who is occasionally sour, but absolutely smolders with an off-the-cuff, confident sensuality. Both have a blazing, and fiery on-screen chemistry - you can utterly believe that they're hot for each other.<br /><br />Tori Spelling is a revelation as Gabe's overzealous and clingy friend who just doesn't get the hint. And her monologue in the caf&eacute; towards the end of the film is absolutely priceless. But the greatest performance in the film takes place inside of a nightclub bathroom, where drag queen Miss Coco Peru tells Gabe to watch out for Mark, that he's bad news, and that she once got certain body fluids of his in her eye.<br /><br />As the evening progresses, Gabe's encounters with his various assortment of kooky, mismatched friends, allows Mark to see him for what he really is, which is much more than just a "trick." Also, as Mark begins to open up to Gabe, the young musician begins to see Mark as far more than just an exotic go-go dancer. Viewers will leave this film with the knowledge that even though the night will soon be over for these two charming, sexy young men; their sparkling new romance is only just beginning.

 | product/productId: 6300249867 | review/userId: A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L | review/summary: A Complex Series Of Seductions & Murders Done By A Devious Woman | review/text: I had to borrow a line from the movie to put in the above title. In full, it went like this: "A complex series of seductions and murders, that's not something you see a woman do," says the boss of Alex Barnes. How wrong was he? Not only was he wrong, but quite sexist. Women have been seducing and murdering men for centuries, and by the late 1980s I'm sure it would have been realized that a woman was more than capable of doing that sort of crime.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot. That has been done elsewhere. What I will say is I loved the storyline and the script. Having two female protagonists duel with one another was a fantastic twist that one rarely saw in the 1980s, to say nothing of today. But 25 years later, this movie still enthralls me. I remember seeing it as a little boy when it was in theatres, and let me tell you it mesmerised me. I also loved the locations--like the now defunct parking lot (Site Of The Reagan Building Today) that was prominently used in the movie Manhunter the previous year.<br /><br />Despite being 25 years old, Black Widow holds up very well. This movie could be remade today and not lose a beat. There are a few plot holes I'll bring up. Was Barnes' scuba tank sabotaged by Catherine? This was never explained after her near fatal drowning. What was Catherine's real name? Who was she? Where did she originate from? Why did she allow Barnes to stick around when she began to suspect her being a federal agent? Why didn't she stop her killings after William McCrory in Seattle? She had more than enough money, and there was no indication in the movie that she was a sociopath so much as her killings were for greed. Indeed, she even cries herself to sleep after the first of her husbands (On Screen) dies, which shows some guilt on her part. How many others had she killed before the events of the movie take place? Could there have been other killings or was her first murder the one shown to us at the beginning of the movie? It would have helped and added more detail had some or all of these questions been answered for the viewers.<br /><br />Leonard Maltin said there was no payoff at the end of the film. Well, to me the payoff was somewhat faulty and contrived. Why would Catherine have admitted to the attempted murder? Also, would she not have attempted to see the "body" of her husband before attempting to claim his money? I mean there was plenty of time and one would have expected her to wait until at least after the funeral before going after poor Paul's money. Yet she does not even attempt to see Paul's body. That to me was/is the biggest flaw in this movie's plot. Despite this, I'm giving it Four Stars.<br /><br />I only wish they would make more movies like this for women.<br /><br />A.

 | product/productId: 6300270726 | review/userId: A34GZPHWYPSY2T | review/summary: "MOONRAKER" Giant Finds Religion | review/text: Oh ye of little age and early vigor: you do not know the hellish days of the 1980s. We were awash with desperation; we longed for jobs but the well was dry. President Reagan had just started ravishing the nation nearly to death. Eastwood hadn't made a Western in 10 years, and his one Western before PALE RIDER was pale indeed.<br /><br />The wife and I went to see PALE RIDER at our happy old haunt that is now torn down, thanks to the same desperation that gave birth to this film. We'd been married less than a year...and we were drooling to see this flick.<br /><br />We were never quite so happy to see a film in our lives.<br /><br />Briefly: a mysterious person (Eastwood) rides into a northern California gold mining camp, full of nice but bullied people. Accompanied by the leader of the camp, he is all silence and majesty. He is marked by one of them as a "gunfighter" and some arguing ensues about his presence--but when he's invited to dinner and appears dressed in clericals, they are gobsmacked. The preacher asks if all the fuss is about him.<br /><br />Naturally he has come to their aid. The friendly leader of the miners (Moriarty) takes a shine to this preacher, especially after the preacher has rescued him from a savage beating in town (which is how meets the preacher in the first place). A fat rich cat (Dysart) wants the land, and is trying to get everyone's legal claims. Finally, fat cat (read: corporation) hires an outlaw posing as a San Francisco marshall to deal with the preacher. Meanwhile, we get a glimpse of a shirtless Eastwood...<br /><br />This man's been riddled with bullets and hanged and unmanned and God knows what else. Yet there he stands. It's the disgusting anti-marshall who did it to him, years before. The marshall and his six pukes get dealt with, end of story.<br /><br />Is the preacher an angel? A ghost? I wonder: why would an angel have sex with an old miner woman? Why would a ghost have to hide himself in order to get the jump on bad guys? I think here, Eastwood is simply the human spirit, that can't just get whipped out of existence, can survive, and come fight another day. That is exactly what he does here...and what a message! We'd never, ever seen any Western like it before. People stood up in the theater and cheered! Including me!<br /><br />People, within their nature I guess, unfairly compare this film to Eastwood's work from decades later. Within just over ten years, he'd made MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL. In the next ten years we'd see the likes of UNFORGIVEN, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, and GRAN TORINO. To compare PALE RIDER to any of these would be like comparing Beethoven to Erik Satie. (I think.)<br /><br />No, this film has to stand for what it is: the most unique and fascinating Western ever made. John Wayne never played so controversial a figure: Eastwood's preacher was the subject of deep theological debate for over 20 years. Apparently he still is.<br /><br />What isn't up for debate is this great film. With its warts, outdated air and its flaws--and there are a few--it stands strong and proud. Even the characters speak the way they ought to, not the way modern people speak.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, you haven't lived. If you haven't collected it, well, now's the time. All I can add is, don't run out and buy yourself a parson's collar. Or a gun. It takes an Eastwood to put those two together and make it work out like a symphony!

I beg to differ.  Why couldn't this happen.  Why couldn't one man turn a world torn apart by war and now run by tyrants into a better place by reuniting those who believed it could be.  At first when it came on, I thought what does this have to do with the postman,  never read the by-line to the movie, so I thought it was about the pony express.  But this is well after that.  I believe if you were to sit down and watch the whole thing...3 hours.  It would make you understand how it could happen.  Critics have no heart, they get paid to make or break a movie, they probably "get paid" by some people to make or break a movie.  This is a great movie, all acting was great, I got so caught up in it; I didn't want to walk away just to get a cup of coffee.  If you have a heart, and if you open it while watching this movie.  You'll love it, and wish there were more at the end.  It is a great movie!

But the story is so cute and entertaining!  I felt so sorry for Babe in the beginning, and almost as proud as the farmer when Babe would do something good such as herding the sheep.  I also liked how each part of the movie had a title telling you what to expect.  And the singing mice...oh, they were so cute and funny!  I wish they would have shown more close-ups of them!<br /><br />Overall, though not worthy of an Academy Award, this is a great movie!  It was much better then I expected.  Some parts might disturb very small children, but other then that I think that this is a great family movie!  Babe is a very likable main character and his friends are enjoable and occasionally funny.  But under the sweet covering is the moral that the director wants for you to walk away with...how would you like to be slaughtered for food?  But though this may affect some, I am sad to say that I am still eating bacon and pork.  Anyway, this is a good movie that children and grown-ups alike will enjoy.

 | product/productId: 0790738147 | review/userId: A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL | review/summary: Modern noir at its finest. | review/text: What is a good cop?  One who joined the police force because he was unable to save his mother from being killed by an abusive husband, but who now uses violence not only against wife-beaters but whenever called for by his superior officers; be it to beat a confession out of a suspect<br />or to discourage criminals from settling in town?  Or one who joined the police force to emulate his father, a department legend; to go after "Rollo Tommasi" (the guy who thinks he can get away with anything), but who thereafter lets his career and department politics dictate his actions?  Or, in the end, is it the one who has let corruption wipe out so thoroughly the reasons why he once joined the police force that he doesn't even remember a single one of them, but who for once in his life still finds it in himself to go after real criminals, even at the risk of his own life?  This is just one, although maybe the central question asked in "L.A. Confidential," the movie based on James Ellroy's novel with the same name.  And as does the book, the movie refuses to provide an answer to this and the other questions it asks.<br /><br />The story is set up by tabloid editor Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), who during the movie's opening credits gleefully sums up the L.A. clich&eacute;s that still hold true today: "Come to Los Angeles!  The sun shines bright, the beaches are wide and inviting, ... there are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap.  Every working man can have his own house, and inside the house a happy, all American family.  You can have all this, and who knows, you can even be discovered - become a movie star or at least, singer.  Life is good in Los Angeles: it's paradise on earth."  Laughing sarcastically, however, he adds:  "That's what they tell ya', anyway, 'cause they're selling an image.  They're selling it through movies, radio, and television."  Then Hudgens proceeds to tell the story of crime boss Mickey C.'s arrest, which left the void in the City of Angels's organized crime scene that sets the stage for this movie's story, and concludes with his tabloid's tag line:  "Remember, dear readers, you heard it here first:  Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush ..."<br /><br />And as indicated in these opening lines, nothing is as it seems in this 1950s' version of a Los Angeles populated by hookers cut to look like movie stars and cops with more or less disreputable alternative sources of income.  As the story progresses, its three heroes - career-driven and pseudo-correct Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), tough-fisted and golden-hearted Wendell "Bud" White (Russell Crowe) and nonchalant, corrupt "celebrity crime stopper" Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) - become unlikely allies in their search for their city's most elusive commodity: the truth.  Shades of gray abound, and even the end, which (unlike the novel's) has at least some redeeming aspects, is not a happy ending by a long shot.<br /><br />Just as many people longingly remembered the days of "The Maltese Falcon," "The Big Sleep" or, for that matter, "Chinatown," proclaimed "they don't make 'em like that anymore" and were ready to announce the death of the noir genre, along came a group of new directors and screenwriters and breathed new life into patient.  "The Usual Suspects" is one excellent example, this one is another.  Unlike other noir stories', this tale's heroes are no private detectives; but all the classic elements of a film noir are there, from a damsel in distress (Veronica Lake-look-alike hooker Lynn Bracken, award-winningly portrayed by Kim Basinger) to crime, corruption and abuse of power, and to dimmed lights and hard boiled dialogue with many memorable one-liners.  In a year overshadowed by the success of the vastly overrated "Titanic," "L.A. Confidential" managed to at least collect the Academy Awards in the best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay categories (Kim Basinger and Brian Helgeland/Curtis Hanson, respectively; the movie had also been nominated in the best picture, best director - again Curtis Hanson -, best original score - Jerry Goldsmith -, best cinematography, best art direction and best editing categories).  And while the 1990s have seen a revival of the noir genre, this one is a standout even among the new films noirs the past decade has brought us.  It made the careers of its writers, director and two of its stars (Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe), and boosted those of several others of its cast members (Kim Basinger and Kevin Spacey, to name just two).  I am sure it will find its eternal place in the annals of Hollywood, alongside its famous predecessors.  There are way too few movies like this these days - if you haven't seen it already, go and buy or rent it soon.  This is modern noir at its finest.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446674249">L.A.

 | product/productId: 6301966937 | review/userId: A1YVPBDG2OFMD2 | review/summary: Underrated classic from legendary Roger Corman. | review/text: One who looks to the theatre, a venue created for the sole purpose of entertainment, for the purpose of witnessing factual accounts of true life stories is a bit naive and more than a little foolish.<br /><br />What? You mean the epic battles depicted in "300" didn't REALLY happen that way?<br /><br />No way! Are you telling me that Mozart wasn't REALLY the bawdy buffoon obsessed with lowbrow humor as depicted in "Amadeus"?<br /><br />When was the last time you saw a film that stuck to straight facts? For me, it was "1492: Conquest of Paradise" back in '92. And yet some still argue that the film is a poor distillation of the truth.<br /><br />"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre" isn't a film full of actual truths, because Roger Corman never meant it to be. It's a fun, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining film with some truly exceptional sets. Do you think he may have been shooting for that instead?<br /><br />Sure, for starters, Robards is a bit hammy as Capone. Yes, he does look nothing like Capone did. But if you're a fan of the era and gangster movies in general, give this one a chance, because it's unquestionably one of the finest b-movies ever to emerge from the storied career of Corman.<br /><br />And by the way, if you want the hard facts, watch a documentary.
 | product/productId: 1574928279 | review/userId: A1GHUN5HXMHZ89 | review/summary: Arabian Nights | review/text: I enjoyed this story of a lady deciding to marry a Sultan to save their people. In order to draw him out of his paranoia that everyone is conspiring against him she tells him tales from the Arabian Nights. At first he is ready to kill her after their wedding. She must make her stories hook him so that he will delay her death till the next night so that she may finish her tale. Like the Odyssey when the tapestry is unwoven to extend the time before an unwanted marriage, the audience is drawn in to see what happens next. All the stories are well done and include favorites like Ali Baba and Aladdin. The tales are well done with a good cast, decent special effects, and excellent directing and editing. A good Hallmark movie worth adding to your collection. Good quality DVD but no extras. If you enjoyed this catch "Hercules".<br /><br />CA Luster

All the funny situations are natural and as such believable.  The outdoor scenary is marvellous.  There is a kind of nostalgia about the making of the movie in a resort lake area.  Watching this movie, takes one back to the simple innocent times when good laughter was appreciated without the fake computer-generated special effects.  Great movie to watch with the family.  Excellent photography.

 | product/productId: 0790734990 | review/userId: A32T2H8150OJLU | review/summary: Only average...not enough humor for a comedy, or even for a satisfying parody/spoof | review/text: Chase, Hines, and Weaver headline this late cold-war era dark comedy, where arms dealers are scrabbling to sell contracts to the US govt. as well as to insurgents, repressive regimes, or anyone else with cash in hand.<br /><br />Chase is a small time independent arms dealer who spends his time in backwater areas nonchalantly strolling amidst rebellions, supplying guerilla groups, etc.  Hines is his partner who stays home, preps and repairs arms for shipping, and finds God.  Weaver is the wife of a salesman from a military tech company who, well, you have to watch to see what happens to him.  Sure enough, pretty soon their paths cross with the possibility of "The Deal of the Century" looming just beyond their grasp.<br /><br />I have to say that I can't really believe that I watched the whole thing.  I mean, I guess I watched it in the hopes that it would eventually get good, or even have some funny bits.  OK, maybe there were about 2, maybe 3 scenes that made me grin, well, half a grin, but nothing made me laugh.

 | product/productId: 6300183092 | review/userId: A1YB29BIDULEYE | review/summary: Repressed Anger Is the True Horror | review/text: This review is dedicated to my friend Patricia who liked these werewolf movies. The movie starts with Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) returning to England after the death of his older brother. While we can sense that there had been some tension between Larry and his father (Claude Rains), things seem to be under control now. (Nonetheless, the point of repressed anger has begun.)<br /><br />Larry seems to be fitting in back in England, and he flirts with a shop owner named Gwen. She is reluctant, but she gives in and goes to a gypsy fair with him, along with her friend Jenny Williams. To some extent, Gwen is flattered by Larry's interest. But she is also engaged to Frank Andrews. (The gamekeeper at Claude Raines's estate.) This is when Jennie is attacked (seemingly by a wolf), and Larry runs to save her. Of course, Larry gets bitten, and poor Jenny was already killed.<br /><br />Certain parties suspect that Larry killed Jenny. While we (along with other characters) know he is innocent, we also know that this is just the start of Larry's problems. He does not become a werewolf right away, but we can see that he is having a difficult time controlling his rages now. (At one point, he looks like he is going to tear a group of women apart with his bare hands.) To be sure, they are unfairly blaming Gwen for Jenny's death; but still, Larry's sudden rage here is disturbing.<br /><br />Later, Larry runs into a gypsy. (The mother of the werewolf who attacked Jenny, and the werewolf Larry killed.) Larry does not want to believe that he will become a werewolf, but he can't entirely dismiss the possibility either. In a sympathetic moment, Larry becomes a werewolf, and we see that he has little (if any) control over his actions. Undoubtedly, this was someone's concept of a man suddenly losing control of his repressed anger.<br /><br />Larry wants to be cured, but what makes things difficult is that no one is really likely to believe his story, and he can not bring himself to  explain everything. (Tragic lack of communication.) An especially sad scene is when Larry gives his father a silver cane that can kill a werewolf.<br /><br />The climax is not only full of action, but there is a tragic twist that reminds us how ugly violence is. Overall, it's a great horror movie that explores the concepts of repressed anger.
 | product/productId: 6301973429 | review/userId: A2RJT770ZA4WQM | review/summary: A Watershed for the Provacateur | review/text: I saw this film when it was first released (a very limited release, I might add, at least in Maryland), and I was about the age of Jeanne, the insouciant young French woman so brilliantly played by Maria Schneider (so sad, her life ended so young and tragically).<br /><br />I was completely dazzled and obsessed with the film. It was something totally different from anything I had ever seen, taking risks and using techniques never before used in any film I had seen.  One is reminded of some of the other cinema greats -- Fellini, for example, who weren't afraid to risk ridicule for their art.  The cinematography, the music, the script, were unlike anyting I had ever seen.  The idea that two people could meet in an apartment in Paris and have the most intimate of relationships, yet know nothing significant about each other -- the thought of this was fascinating.  Of course, all is bathed in the lurid light of the French apartment.<br /><br />Now that I am older and more jaded, I see this for what it is -- groundbreaking, and thus, dated.  Like "Saturday Night Live", nothing like it had been attempted before, so it seemed better than it really is.  I am sure it has been done better since.  However, a few things remain untouched and absolutely stellar:  1)  Brando's performance, which is incomparable in its pain and absolute believability 2) the musical score (by the great Gato Barbieri 3) the cinematography, only surpassed by Fellini.<br /><br />One must own this as one must own any classic.
 | product/productId: 0800187849 | review/userId: ADKZOXAOV8EXD | review/summary: Really funny - recommended | review/text: Movies like this don't get much respect but this one is really cute. The plot is nothing special, a predictable comedy formula; Jon Lovitz is a bumbling but good-hearted schlemiel of a teacher in a wild inner city school. But the movie is well written with great jokes and sight gags. At the beginning, Lovitz is teaching in a fancy private school, where the receptionist answers the phone "Are you white?" before she directs the call. The depiction of the mean, arrogant rich boys who study there is painfully accurate. Then he moves to the ghetto school where there is a reserved parking space for the SWAT team. Guards patrol the upper tier of the school auditorium just like a state prison yard. There are many such brilliant touches and Jon Lovitz is loveable as always.<br /><br />Tia Carrere is as lovely as any Hollywood actress could be. Really a beautiful woman, at least as good an actress as Cameron Diaz, and better than Demi Moore. Don't know why she is always stuck in B space.<br /><br />Fun to watch or rent - recommended

It has always been one of my favorite stories. I didn't realize then that the main character is voiced by John Ritter. The cover art is misleading as the animation is more serious than that. It reminds me of the style of The Last Unicorn (it may be made by some of the same people) though I like this movie much better. It really is a must buy for any avid fantasy animation fan.
 | product/productId: 630021592X | review/userId: A92LD431P843F | review/summary: Never take a girl on a boat when there's MONEY involved! | review/text: Go-Go dancin' Dodie Marshall is an 'anything goes' type o' chick when it comes to guys rubbing women in paint and rolling said women on paper and calling it art. And she doesn't judge overweight British women married to Charles Laughton for their unusual Yoga instruction, or...just about anybody! But if you look for gold on a shiprecked vessel, man you are nowhere! Elvis was nowhere. He got nowhere when he got digits from the Love Machine. He got nowhere when making time with a blonde adventurous dish. And he got nowhere when trying to rent sea venture equipment from a TV show hasbeen who belongs on the short bus (if you know what I mean). But Elvis has his pride, has his charm, has his swagger, and has his bravado. And he entertains in this movie in spite of some slow points and some real clunkers, when the movie decides to pay too much attention to the ridiculous kiddie show captain.<br />Good music, funny looks at beatniks making a scene, and Elvis getting camera time are all reasons to see this movie. And if you wanted to catch a little more Dodie than what you saw in Spinout (yep. She was the hottie who played drums at the end of Spinout. Mama Mia!) then this is worth the trip. It's average on the Elvis Movie-O-Meter. It won't be your favorite, but it's a good enough addition to the library.

It absolutely did not.  Aside from a small gasp at the beginning &quot;Look...it's Donny Osmond  with long hair!&quot;, Donny absolutes owns this role.  Maria Friedman is  the best narrator.  She is hysterical throughout.  Everyone else was superb  also.  Sometimes I feel I am in the minority that believes theater is  **supposed** to be light and fun.

 | product/productId: 0783225725 | review/userId: A5TZXWU8AALIC | review/summary: "...looks like the wrong dogs came home." | review/text: This was always my favorite Clint Eastwood Western.  UNFORGIVEN would come close years later, but I still enjoy DRIFTER, Clint's first Western as a director (he directed PLAY MISTY FOR ME previously).<br /><br />The supernatural touches and haunting wisps of music add another layer of mystery to the story.  Is Clint's "Stranger" a real person, or is he the restless ghost of the marshal bullwhipped to death in the streets of Lago?<br /><br />That question elevates the film from the familiar Western revenge story, by then growing a little long in the tooth by 1973.  The wholesale revenge exacted on everyone in the town as well as the thuggish killers, the sight of the entire town painted red (with "Hell" sloppily painted on its sign), the way Clint emerges from the desert heat vapors in the opening--it all gives the film a lot of style and intrigue.<br /><br />It makes for a very cool Western.
 | product/productId: 5559899887 | review/userId: A1EM0U9W4UM9AH | review/summary: Outstanding | review/text: Got it today, did it today! Wai Lana doesn't dress like the other video yoginis and the video covers are colored somewhat like kid videos so I bypassed her for WAY too long.  She doesn't demonstrate modifications but even without prior yoga experience her instructions and encouragement to do the best you can are enough, imo.  This video starts off with the shoulders which is wonderfully different, especially since mine are extremely tight and the beginning postures completely release them and the upper back.  The asanas have different names than you're probably used to but the pacing is perfect so there's absolutely no stress or straining.  I don't think you can call this gentle yoga because you will be doing much more than mild stretches with Wai Lana but the music, scenery and her voice overs make it so accessible that it's quite relaxing. Okay, I thought, so she leads a thorough session, how's she going to do with the relaxation at the end?  Fortunately, it was wonderful (woo-woo free) and if you peek you'll see tranquil and uplifting scenes of happy people, wildlife and water.  All the visuals are superb throughout and now I'm thinking the other yoginis have been shortchanging me! If you're want something slower and with little heat, Wai Lana may be what you're looking for.

 | product/productId: 079073463X | review/userId: A1HCHMYMPO97CL | review/summary: Enchanting Medievil Love Tale | review/text: LadyHawke is a simply beautiful, enchanting and most romantic medievil tale of two lovers doomed by the darkened curse of an evil and jealous bishop. By day, the delicately exquisite Lady Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) is transformed into a graceful Hawke, while her beloved and heroic Captain Ettienne Navarre(Rutger Hauer), takes on the form of a black Wolf through the night. Never the twain shall meet in human form, destined to never consummate their love. The devoted lovers can do nought but roam hopelessly, though never parted, waiting for a miracle and divine sign that the curse may somehow be broken. It comes in the form of a recently escaped prisoner, the quick and crafty theif, Phillipe 'The Mouse' Gaston(Matthew Broderick). Who, saved by Navarre and later assisted by a rougly eccentric and exiled Monk (played by veteran actor Leo Mckern), guides them to the key which will undo the curse and re-unite them, helping to ward off their attackers and enemies along the way.<br />LadyHawke handles the medievil genre with class and wit. Artfully directed and photogaphed, it is fast paced with plenty of action and thrills, whilst always maintaining the mystical and mythical poetry of the story beautifully. The script balances both modern comical elements with classic romance and imagery in a way which keeps the viewer both entertained and enchanted. Whilst the tragic dilemma of Navarre and Isabeau, along with their profound love for each other, is captured and presented in a way which is heartfelt and sublimely moving.<br />The actors are most suitably cast for this film. Pfeiffer; with her delicate, stunning classic beauty and refined grace, is perfect as Isabeau. And the lessor known 'Hauer', makes a most dashing and teutonically hansome Captain Navarre. Indeed an impressive and imposing, almost futuristic figure, all in black aloft his majestic, powerfull horse, 'Golaith'. But the film would not have been as successful or enjoyable without the delightful performance of Broderick as 'Phillipe'; who's character provides a comic lightness and suitable contrast within the story, that is cleverly subtle and droll. Added to this is an impressive supporting cast of very high class and calibre; including 'John Wood', who is just wonderful as the unsettlingly sinister and powerful Bishop.<br />The film, with its magical premise of the lovers' spirits being trapped within that of a beautiful bird of prey and majestic wild beast, has a very mystical feel and is quite visually stunning. The romantic and metaphorical imagery of this period and genre has always captivated me, I must admit. Part fairy tale/fantasy and romantic legend and part action packed adventure, it has all the ingredients to make it an enduring favourite and classic piece of cinema. My only criticism is that of the quite '80's' musical score which doesn't really capture the mood or emotion of the film. It is not one I would have chosen and does seem quite out of place. I realize that they chose it in order to give the story a more modern 'Hollywood action' kind of feel and undertone, but it didn't really work for me. I would have prefered some haunting celtish pipes and drums or suitable classical style. Apart from that, LadyHawke is a very well crafted, visually beautiful and riveting movie, perfect for watching on a rainy sunday.

 | product/productId: 0780616456 | review/userId: A141IUB4JJPDB1 | review/summary: Red Harvest retold through Gun Poetry | review/text: As far as I know, this makes the second movie produced that's based on Dashiell Hammett's 'Red Harvest' (same guy who wrote The Thin Man and The Maltese Falcon). The first was Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo', which is undoubtedly a classic of Japanese cinema, itself spawning a revolution in American movie making when Sergio Leone began making all of Kurosawa's Samurai flicks into what we now know as Spaghetti Westerns.<br /><br />If you've seen Yojimbo, or its western rendition `A Fistful of Dollars', and enjoyed either one, then you should get quite a kick out of this Bruce Willis Powered send up to Hammett's first foray into grunge fiction. We already know the story (lonely town, gangs, double crossing, woman, money, gunfights, no good guy just bad guys and indifferent guys), so the delivery is what's going to make the movie.<br /><br />So how's the delivery? Absolutely Gun-alicious!<br /><br />The whole movie is quite visceral; the gun fights are reminiscent of John Woo (slightly unrealistic, but convincing) and the dialogue is retailored to match the characters delivery, whether it be quiet and whispered, loud and obnoxious, or just mumbles. Bruce Willis was the perfect choice for the lead, menacing and believable as always. My favorite casting choice was Christopher Walken, the great character actor of our generation. The humor and insanity he brought to `Last Man Standing' is what really tied the whole movie together, and earned it 5 solid stars.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Know the history of this movie, and you'll enjoy it all the more.
 | product/productId: 6301773551 | review/userId: A2J00K3J9KPQD3 | review/summary: Great Movies- Star Wars (1977) | review/text: May 25, 1977 is the day that many people call the day that movies died, comparable to the day of Buddy Holly's death ("the day the music died"). This may be true, but George Lucas' "Star Wars" has been a classic ever since it first hit the silver screen. The brilliant use of special effects and adapting a classic story of good vs. evil has captivated "Star Wars" to become not just a great movie, but one of the most successful products in the history of the entertainment business.<br /> "Star Wars" is not necessarily about a story, since it is derived from multiple tales, but the movie itself is about how the story can be brought to its greatest. Taking much influence from Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey", Lucas brought a new meaning to visual effects in film. But like Steven Spielberg's "E.T." or especially like "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Star Wars" was a technical watershed and a lot of fun at the same time.<br /> To watch "Star Wars" is not to just watch a movie. Watching "Star Wars" is being brought into the movie itself, which is extremely kind to its audience. It wants us to feel like Luke Skywalker as he dreams of adventure; or Han Solo, as the bad-boy smuggler who thinks himself all too cool; or Darth Vader, with enough power to strike terror into people's hearts; or at times we can feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi, who gives his knowledge of the Force and a lightsaber to Luke. (The first appearance of a lightsaber in the film is one of the most magical moments in cinematic history.)<br /> The generosity of "Star Wars" is the very reason why it has remained one of the biggest movies in history. Now what do I mean when I say generosity? Unlike most big blockbusters today, "Star Wars" respects its audiences. It doesn't just throw its plot at you and expect you to follow wooden characters. Instead, George Lucas teaches us about his imagination step by step, as we follow lovable characters that we begin to feel as real people.<br /> But since the opening of "Star Wars" in 1977, many people have tried to capture what Lucas achieved through the use of innovative special effects and a heart-warming narrative. Only certain movies like "E.T.", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy have captured at least a tenth of what "Star Wars" reached.<br /> Could "Star Wars" (and "Jaws" to a certain extent) though, have caused the death of cinema? Though filmmakers like Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese still tried to achieve the great American movie, most directors have been shooting for the next "Star Wars". James Cameron is a perfect example of this, though none of his films have the amount of depth to them as "Star Wars" does.<br /> Lucas was credited at the time for writing corny dialogue (Harrison Ford actually blamed him for this) and yet he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for "Star Wars". Though it didn't win, his screenplay has remained incredibly influential throughout the years. Almost every line in the movie is a near-classic one-liner, from "What a piece of junk!" to "That's no moon. It's a space station."<br /> The use of the music has also been quite influential (I could talk for hours just about the music in "Star Wars"). John Williams' original score harkened back to some classic grand scores such as Max Steiner's for "Gone With the Wind" and Maurice Jarre's for "Lawrence of Arabia." Whenever I hear a piece of music from the movie, I can quickly identify what section of the film is happening. The music has not only been influential in the sense of music composition. Many sections of the score have become staples in pop culture, as most people will recognize the Force theme, Princess Leia's theme, and of course, the main title theme.<br /> The amount of warmth that "Star Wars" gives to its audience is just overwhelming. From John Williams' iconic score (which several composers have been mimicking for years) to the shots on the planet Tatooine, every moment of the film gives an unimaginable amount of heart to whoever it is entertaining.<br /> I first saw the movie when I was 15 years old. Quickly, it became my favorite film of all time, and it still remains my favorite film. To watch "Star Wars" is to experience imagination at its greatest potential. The amount of movies that it has influenced over the years is too great to describe, and the amount of people it inspired is, at the very least, big. That is to say, "Star Wars" is not just a movie or a collection of movies. It is a way that people can see the world through. It is a new way to look at movies, to criticize them and to praise them. There have been many imitators over the years, but none have come close to the majesty that is "Star Wars."

I saw it for the first time this week and it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting is touching, simple and varied. Of course the headliners, Dustin Hoffman very good, Jon Voight sublime, attracted all the attention, but every role, no matter how small is perfectly rendered. The story and direction are sure and relaxed and do not show age.<br />To me, the best years of American cinema are the late sixties and seventies.<br />Sherif Laoun

After years of seeing him as the wholesome good guy Andy Taylor it was great to see Andy's acting range and he hit it out of the park. I understand that this movie was based on a true story and a book with the same title. I never read the book and had no knowledge of the story before I saw the movie. I pulled the movie out the other day and watched it and I must say that it totally holds up. The casting is perfect and the director really takes you back to the period with all the cars, the wardrobe and the look of the film.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anybody who likes good movies and good story telling.

My VHS copy is a little worn. Some reviews say this is a movie to be viewed only once because of its subject matter. I personally think this movie should be shown in all middle school classrooms (along with Bowling for Columbine).  If you are ever down or depressed about something, just watch this movie and all your problems will seem petty compared to what these brave souls endured.  It really helps me/saddens me/humbles me to watch the movie and once viewed, it will never leave your mind.

 | product/productId: 6301978684 | review/userId: ATSWIYN2BJDVP | review/summary: My father thanks you, my mother thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you! | review/text: What a classic line from an American film. This movie chronicles the life story of George M. Cohan, who was a proud Irish-American. He worked for years with his family on the vaudeville circuit primarily in the north-east portion of the United States. James Cagney played the lead role of George M. Cohan. Just as Mr. Cohan was an American Icon, so was James Cagney. I never saw the "real" George M. Conhan, but James Cagney was BRILLIANT in this film. All of the songs throughout the film were written by George M. Cohan.<br /><br />This movie is the story of a very patriotic man, and for you to enjoy this film you should be the type of person that loves the flag of the USA, and who believes in patriotism. Otherwise, you will be bored out of your mind. If on the other hand, (as I am) you are one of those flag-waving, American-loving, eyes well with tears during the Star Spangled Banner types, then you will LOVE this movie.

 | product/productId: 078061965X | review/userId: A35YWA2V4QHOJ3 | review/summary: A great spy thriller! | review/text: It is obvious that the film this one will be most compared to is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023B1LC">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>.  Some will call this a "women's version" of Jason Bourne.  While this label may have some degree of veracity, it is only fair to note that this movie came out 7 years BEFORE the first BOURNE film.<br /><br />There are, however, a lot of parallels between the films.  On that point there is no argument.  Like Jason Bourne, Samantha Kane (played by Davis) has amnesia, and eventually discovers that she is a CIA assassin.  However, it takes about a decade before this begins to come into view.  In the meantime, she becomes a housewife and a mother & lives a "normal" life in the 'burbs.<br /><br />When she is discovered to still be alive, some rather nasty people (both bad guys + the CIA) want her dead - NOW!  Luckily, she is able to invoke the help of her newfound good buddy, Mitch (played by Sameul L. Jackson).  Normally, Mitch is a 2-bit private detective who makes more $$ swindling people than anything else.  He goes from that life to becoming involved in a cloak-and-dagger struggle of the 10th degree.<br /><br />While Jackson is great & all, there are in the end 2 words that convey why you should see this movie: Gina Davis.  She is absolutely outstanding in the role of a good-neighborly housewife who must switch into being a cold-blooded killer.  I do not hype up Gina just because she is a pretty face.  Anyone who has read any number of my reviews knows that I've been known to slam a great many pretty-faces who could not act.  This is a role that I can think of very few women in Hollywood pulling off (Charlize Theron is about the only other one I can think of off-hand).  Some of my other favorite actresses, such as Jennifer Connolley, Sandra Bullock and Madeline Stowe are all fine actresses.  However, they all lack the "edge" and intensity to fill this role.  Whoever casted Gina Davis for this role should get many kudos!<br /><br />If you are into action movies / spy movies / cloak-and-dagger movies that have lots of excitement, then this film is for you.  Yes, some of the action sequences are not believable, but this is after all an ACTION movie!  You always have to sacrifice some degree of believability for a great action flick.  So, with that said, the best advice I can offer is for you to allow Gina Davis to give you a long kiss goodnight.  Who would refuse that?!?!?

 | product/productId: 079215827X | review/userId: A2WFNZWC8O6O1J | review/summary: Stays Just as Fun Now as Before! | review/text: INDIANA JONES is the ultimate action hero.  Superman doesn't compare.  Leave Jason Bourne at the door.  Sure, they're great and all, but Indy started it all.<br /><br />When I heard that all three INDIANA JONES movies were coming out on a trilogy three-pack, I was excited.  I had watched the films on old VHSs over and over, but I new I was going to have to replace them sometime.  This box set gave me the chance.<br /><br />The box set contains all three movies plus a bonus disc of special features.  The bonus disc doesn't exceed expectations but it very well meets them.  It includes a three-part documentary on all three films, featurettes, trailers, and DVD-rom features.<br /><br />The movies themselves:<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK: It's a classic.  The whip.  The hat.  This movie was what made those two landmark props icons.  The film suceeds in all aspects of story, action, and climax.  The film is brilliantly scored by mastermind John Williams (of JAWS and STAR WARS fame).  The special effects at the climax aren't as realistic as, say, THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies, but one must remember that the film was made more than 20 years ago.<br /><br />THE TEMPLE OF DOOM:  Dark.  Action-packed.  Dark.  Scary.  And did I mention dark?  The second installment of the series is, by far, the darkest of the three.  In my opinion, some of the scenes in The Temple of Doom itself are unnessecary, and that whole Indy-recites-Hindu-spell thing towards the end of the film didn't quite work for me.  But the hilarious opening action scene ("Where's the diamond?") and the bridge sequence, not the mention the extraordinary mine car chase, make the film worth watching.  Just fast forward when you see the grinning madman reaching for a guy's chest.<br /><br />THE LAST CRUSADE: What can I say?  Rarely are two films in the trilogy classics.  RAIDERS and CRUSADE are the classics of this trilogy.  RAIDERS topped all of my charts, but I must say CRUSADE is my favorite Indy film thus far (I still have yet to see the fourth one, not yet released).  The touching storyline, intense action, and witty humor make this the best of the three films.  Sean Connery joins the brilliant cast as Indy's father, who is an archaeologist like his son, but has yet to adjust to the whole machine-gun thing.  This one's a must-see.<br /><br />Overall, this trilogy is well-worth buying.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best DVD trilogy boxsets out there, along with the original STAR WARS TRILOGY and BACK TO THE FUTURE.  All three films are good and the bonus disc doesn't disappoint.  Indy fans looking for a great buy, here's your chance.<br /><br />I just hope the fourth installment can live up to the milestone status that these three have created.<br /><br />Highly reccommended.

 | product/productId: 0780618548 | review/userId: A34GZPHWYPSY2T | review/summary: Hold my fuzzy pink sweater while I get my Glock | review/text: THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT (1996) is one of those rare and extremely quirky, tongue-in-cheek black comedies that thrills, chills and splits your sides simultaneously. This is among the first of its kind, a silly spy contrivance with lots of action, witty dialogue that would have made Shakespeare envious, and absolutely no real logic to it.<br /><br />In short, Samantha Caine (a red-hot Geena Davis), a frumpy housewife, mother and gradeschool teacher, is really Charlotte "Charly" Baltimore - CIA assassin and Cold War ultra-weapon. An assassination attempt leaves her with amnesia and from what I can tell, she's been in her comfortable life for around five or six years.<br /><br />A failed series of private investigators has caused her to give her old identity "the long kiss goodnight" - until crusty old Mitch Henessy, P.I. (a hilarious and powerful Samuel L. Jackson) discovers what she wants to know. While he has some answers, even he will suffer from finding out who she is exactly.<br /><br />This film is a great ride, roller coaster all the way, of spy action, evil agencies and double-crossers, an angry president whose budget is tied up ("Can you say 'EDUCATION'?!" he sneers). As I say, look not for logic, there be none here - just pure fun like only the 1990s could really produce. The special effects are well worth it alone ... this is one of the first movies to utilize CGI in-action. (The other major film to do that was the original JURASSIC PARK.)<br /><br />While this film did borrow a tiny bit - more of a homage really - that it got from PULP FICTION (1994), it is highly original and excellent for all that.<br /><br />There is so much to love about this film, which makes you laugh out loud and makes your skin crawl at the same time. I was extremely taken with the appearance of Patrick Malahide (as CIA director Leland Perkins) because I actually had not seen him since he played Alfred Jingle in the 1984 tv film "The Pickwick Papers" (vid. my review). He's done a great deal of work, in fact, and here I thought he might be dead.<br /><br />Consider the top films of the year, which this thing had to vie with: THE ENGLISH PATIENT, FARGO, INDEPENDENCE DAY, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, the foolish TRAINSPOTTING and TWISTER. THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT did not actually get buried, but because it was such a trend-setter, and so many films resulted with similar names, I think it got lost in the tidal wave.<br /><br />Don't let it be lost. Get it and savor it: you won't see its like, ever again.

Bottom line,Dante's Peak is a gripping thrillride about a mountian ready to blow and a town not ready to accept the truth.With a heartpounding score,great action and a good plot,it's no wonder why I enjoy this movie and I hope you will as well.
 | product/productId: 0780624378 | review/userId: A2C6LOYAPWFRP8 | review/summary: Inside Look at a Genius Filmmaker | review/text: Having long enjoyed Allen's films, I was fascinated to get an inside look at what the human being Woody Allen is like.  I found it especially moving to see this small-sized guy looking so tiny amid the hordes of fans  crowding around him, and I admire his bravery more at having allowed  himself, an intensely private person, to become &quot;public&quot; for the  sake of the New Orleans jazz he loves. The interaction with Previn is  especially surprising, since the media portrays her as a silent figure. My  favorite detail was that his Oscar award statues sit like so many  knick-knacks on his parents' upper shelf. If only the directors who live in  Hollywood were as down to earth as Allen. Made me realize the difference  between the Hollywood crowd and directors who chose to live outside the  cocoon. Allen jokes about himself as a &quot;scumbag&quot; at one point,  feeling like a real outsider amid opulence. This is a touching, interesting  film, and the music is very charming. I also loved the fact that when he  makes a witty side comment, his companions are clearly so used to it that  they barely notice any more that he is constantly making sly wisecracks.

James Brown put together the soundtrack for this film and has some of his best music on here, instrumentals by the JB's that went  on to become samples for hip hop favorites, as well as some great tracks  including The Boss (quoted) and Born and raised in NYC -  &quot;I was born  in new york city, on a monday, seems I was out shinin shoes by tuesday  noon!&quot;  The movie itself is surprisingly pretty good.  Tommy is  intense and a real bad ass. Neither a simple robin hood, nor a total  villian, he's a good character.
 | product/productId: 0780622537 | review/userId: A39CX0EE4BZCZC | review/summary: Very, Very Creepy | review/text: This gets good marks simply because it is such an interesting, involving story that hooks you right away and every time you watch it and doesn't overwhelm you with violence and gore.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is appealing as always as the good guy and John Goodman is surprisingly low-key for most of the movie. All the characters are very interesting and the special effects are creepy. The story is pure "Hollywood theology" mean also means the characters - include the heroes - in here have no clue about God or the purpose of life.<br /><br />The DVD provides excellent entertainment. The visuals are decent on this disc and sound-effects are chilling in spots. As the demon sees through the eyes of people and passes by with these "whoosh" sounds, it's very effective. As mentioned, the film doesn't need a lot of violence to succeed with it's horror-type tale.<br /><br />One note about the final scene.  if you get confused, you aren't alone. Maybe I'm not too bright because it took me a couple of viewings to see it all in perspective.

Jeanne Moreau is brilliant as the gorgeous and unstoppable avenger who neatly works her way down the list of men (a playboy, a neurotic loser, a sleazy politician, a gangster and an artist) responsible for her husband's tragic/comic demise on the cathedral steps years before.  Each method of murder is more creative and outlandish than the last and the narrative is peppered with clever little references like one of the victims living on &quot;Nemesis St.&quot; and the killer taking a job in an art studio posing as Diana the Huntress.

His erudite speech patterns add to the comedy in a macabre and hilarious manner.  The two murderous old ladies' road to "somewhere" is certainly paved with "good intentions."

Add the complications of romance to the simmering cauldron and we wonder how it can all work out. It is a must-see for those who have not seen this gem.

 | product/productId: 0783231482 | review/userId: A2Z44AN3F2IN61 | review/summary: classic comedy | review/text: When Jake and Elwood Blues are reunited after Jake's stint in Joliet, Jake finds that the beloved Bluesmobile has been replaced by a former City of Mount Prospect police car, and the Blues Brothers Band has been disbanded.<br /><br />They visit "the penguin," the nun who runs the orphanage where they grew up, only to find that the orphanage will be shut down unless they come up with $5000 in back taxes. Since she vetoes any suggestion of ill-gotten gains, Jake comes up with a plan: put the band back together.<br /><br />From then on it's non-stop action, laughs, and music, as they're "on a mission from God" to collect the former band members one by one, equip them, then try to get enough gigs to earn the money. Along the way, they also collect quite a trail of people out to get them: a mystery woman armed with everything from a bazooka to a flamethrower, Illinois Nazis, a country-western band, as well as the cops.<br /><br />Star-studded doesn't begin to cover the casting, either. It's practically a who's who of rhythm and blues, as well as immediately recognizable actors. Check the IMDB for the list.<br /><br />As with Blazing Saddles, the humor is hilarious without being pointless. Maybe I'm showing my age, but my sons agreed, and it's something we've discussed about other movies as well. In this case, nobody's safe from being skewered by humor, and everything's a target: relationships, crime, racism, poverty, country music, etc., etc. It's no surprise that The Blues Brothers' roots are in the original irreverent TV show (SNL).<br /><br />Anyway, it's a classic that I never get tired of, and I'm not a very patient person when it comes to re-watching movies, so that's saying something. Plus, it's fun to send the boys off to school in the morning with "remember, you're on a mission from God." (Okay, maybe that's just fun for me.)

Co-written and directed by Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Dead & Buried, Blue Thunder), the film features an excellent cast including Clu Gulager (McQ, A Force of One), James Karen (Poltergeist, Apt Pupil, Superman Returns), Don Calfa (Chopper Chicks in Zombietown, Weekend at Bernie's), and Thom Mathews (Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Alien from L.A.).

N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Jr. (Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, Carnosaur 2), scream queen Linnea Quigley (Creepozoids, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama), Mark Venturini, who sadly passed away in 1996, and Brian Peck, the only actor to appear in all three Return of the Living Dead films.<br /><br />As the film begins, we find ourselves at the Uneeda Medical Supply company `You need it...we got it'.  It's Freddie's (Mathews) first day as a stockboy, and co-worker Frank (Karen) is showing him the ropes, along with the prosthetics, bedpans, skeletons, and yes, cadavers (man, they weren't kidding about having what I need, particularly in a nice bedpan).  A curious Freddie inquires as to what's the weirdest thing Frank has ever seen during his long tenure at the company to which Frank relates a fantastic tale about how some years ago, a chemical created a chemical for the military that had a strange side effect, namely, it brought the dead back to life.  The resulting mess was cleaned up, and the reanimated corpses were stuffed into sealed containers.  Many of the supposedly true events were then turned into a film that we know as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (nice acknowledgement), although a number of facts were changed to avoid litigation.  Anyway, due to a military snafu, some of the containers were accidentally shipped to Uneeda, and have been sitting in the basement ever since, undisturbed...until now...while showing Freddie the containers, Frank slaps the side of one, a seal breaks, and the gas squirts out all over the two men knocking them out, and also into the air ducts, which, in turn, revives the corpsicle in the freezer.  The boys begin to freak, and decide to call the owner Burt (Gulager), figuring he'll know what to do...after some debating, then end up hacking the lively decedent into parts, stuffing the parts into garbage bags, taking said bags across the street to the crematorium and asking the resident mortician Ernie Kaltenbrunner (Calfa), who Burt's been friends with for a long time (get it?  Burt and Ernie?  Ah well...) to burn the evidence.  Ernie finally agrees, and the parts do burn into ash, but an unforeseen result is the smoke from the burning of the body is released through the chimney.  This, coupled with the quickly approaching thunderstorm, causes the fumes to seep into the ground, causing a...reaction among the long dormant residents of the graveyard, the same graveyard Freddie's friends are hanging out at while waiting for Freddie to get off work...well, I think you can put two and two together and surmise, like the South, the dead shall rise again, and they do...and they're hungry...for juicy, juicy brains...<br /><br />I think this is a great movie, for someone who can appreciate it...one of the best aspects of the film are the colorful and distinctive characters, played very well by the actors.  There isn't a whole lot of development, but they're still interesting enough to keep you watching.  Perhaps my favorite character of the film was that of Burt, the boss and owner of the medical supply company played by Clu Gulager.  His pragmatism played off extremely well off the exponentially growing horror of the animated corpses, and created a sort of bizarre sense that he was more worried about how all this was going to affect business, rather than for his own mortality.  Eventually he does realize the grievous nature of the situation, but up until then it was pretty funny, particularly because he didn't overplay it...my favorite scene involved the sequence after Burt and the boys hacked up the spastic corpse and then brought it across the street to the mortuary, in an effort to get Burt's friend Ernie to get rid of everything by burning it up in his crematorium.  At first Burt tries to explain the wiggling bags as a shipment of rabid weasels, rather than tell Ernie the truth.  After awhile, and many questions from Ernie, Burt finally does come clean, but his initial attempts at subterfuge are hilarious.  A couple of other great performances are given by James Karen as Frank, the long time warehouse employee seeming happy to have a new apprentice, even to the point of showing off a little, and Don Calfa as Ernie, the gun toting mortician who develops a scientific interest in the corpses.  Thom Mathews also did very well, especially near the end of the picture, as the sickness from inhaling the noxious gas earlier finally overtakes him.  The walking dead were much more lively and active in this film, more so than I had seen in films previous, which added a nice spin to the notion that the reanimated dead are only capable of lumbering about.  In terms of special effects and make up, the detail in the corpses was most excellent, especially that half woman corpse the group captures and Ernie questions in the latter half of the movie.  Also, the Tarman corpse, the one that was released from the military container, was exquisitely detailed and the actor who played the part had his movements down perfectly, or at least in terms of how I thought a recently released from his barrel, rotting, festering, slimy corpse would move about.  Everything worked so well together here, the directing, the script, quotable dialog, the humor, the nasty bits, the acting, all tied together with a carefully chosen soundtrack featuring bands like, among others, T.S.O.L, The Damned, The Flesheaters, Roky Erickson, and The Cramps.  All in all, a completely harmonious balance and truly fun entertainment for the sick and twisted.  Oh yeah, there's a couple of great nekkid bits featuring Jewel Shepard, who plays a punky girl obsessed with all things gruesome and morbid.<br /><br />This DVD release features both the widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, along with a fullscreen version, both looking sharp and clean.  The Dolby Digital audio also comes through very well and clear.  As far as special features, there is an audio commentary track with director Dan O'Bannon and production designer William Stout (I was kinda surprised they didn't get any of the actors involved), along with a featurette titled `Designing the Dead' (13:37), conceptual artwork by William Stout, TV spots, and both an G rated and R rated trailers for the film.<br /><br />Cookieman108
 | product/productId: 6301387090 | review/userId: ASCBAUYGN66FU | review/summary: Heart warm every time I see it!!!!!! | review/text: This is a great movie, one of the best.  I have watched this movie several times on TV and a couple of days ago, I watched it on TCM.  I had forgotten how great Tom Tryon is as Father Foymolle.  The other actors, who did so well, in the roles that they portrayed were extremely good.  The music, for those who love movie music themes, was written by the same person who wrote the music for "The Big Country".<br /><br />It is well worth buying and a constant reminder of all the ill effects of the times back in the days after WWI and now.  There is a tremendous colliating of ill feelings that are felt by all of us in one time or another, and are still striving to deminish(sp).
 | product/productId: 6300183971 | review/userId: A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO | review/summary: An epic that just doesn't cut it | review/text: Dune(released Dec/84),is an overly long and erratic tome that in the end fails to satisfy.It is chock full of stars like Jose Ferrer,Patrick Stewart,Linda Hunt,Kyle Maclachlin,Sting,Max Von Sydow,Dean Stockwell,Sean Young and many,many more,but the sheer immensity of the talent on hand still isn't enough to give this film more than just an average score.The book was first published in 1965 and I recall it was a must read among my buddies.The author wrote five more sequels,none of which this movie attempted to integrate...thank goodness!<br />The plot is a hard one to follow but in general terms it consists of one planet whose surface is mined for the spice melange,called Arrakis.It is highly valuable stuff and when production of it starts to waver,or at least the potential of a slow down is seen,the Emperor Shaddam is under scrutiny by its trading partners.A direct threat to his power is the Duke Atreides,who has a son who has foretold prophecies of the future that have affected the Emperor.The Emperor schemes to let the Duke take control of the mining operations on Arrakis.However Baron Harkonnen the sadistic ruler of another planet has been given permission by the Emperor to invade Arrakis and kill the Duke and his son and take control of the mining operations there.<br />The Duke,his son and mother arrive on Arrakis and are given a tour of the spice mining operations.The biggest threat to the miners are the gigantic worms that are attracted to sounds and have been known to destroy the machines and kill miners in the process.The Fremen are the inhabitants of Arrakis and up until now their numbers have been vastly underestimated.The Duke wants to make an alliance with the Fremen but before he can do that the Harkonnens attack.During this time the Duke is killed but his son and his mother escape into the deep deserts.While seeking refuge from a sandworm they meet up with a local tribe of Fremen.They take the dukes son to be a fulfillment of a long held prophecy,which coincides with the myriad of dreams the Dukes son has had all of his life.He is now the Muaddib and becomes leader of the Fremen.He leads a revolt against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and regains control of Arrakis for the Fremen.The film ends as rain,which hasn't fallen in centuries,comes down on an astonished populace.<br />Director David Lynch focuses I think too much on the characters of the film such as the Baron Harkonnen,played a little over the top by Ken McMillan,and leaves the plot to meander from one episode to the other.It seems to shift from an over the topper like the Baron to an understated and more subtle performance such as Dr Kynes,played nicely by Max Von Sydow,and back again.As a result the film is reduced to a roller coaster ride that can get boring awfully fast.<br />Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and needs a remastering as the film can be a bit too grainy at times.There are no extras to speak of.<br />In conclusion Dune is just an average film chock full of great talent that really had no where to go.Dune,to do the book(s)up right,should be given to a Peter Jackson,who did the Lord of the Rings up properly.He could do great things with this series of Sci-Fi classics,but if you're looking for Dune done properly,read the books;it hasn't been put onto celluloid yet!

I opened it and there were only a couple of dents in the paper, but that's from shipping. I opened it and saw all six disks still in the package. I expected at least one to be flopping around, but the case is designed for it not to. I immediately put all three onto iTunes via Digital Copy. Then all day I sat and watched one of the best trilogies ever. Perfect. For the price I bought it at ($14.99) Best decision ever. I actually felt like I was stealing it it was such a great price.

If you want to know how Apple Computers and Microsoft got their starts, watch this and then read a little bit.  Isn't it funny how everything is usually related?  That is how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs got where they are today.  And, as always, a movie with text at the end (you know, when the movie tells you what happened to the characters after the acting is over but before the credits) is never a letdown!  Buy it, or just borrow it from someone who has it.
 | product/productId: 5554743994 | review/userId: A39IY0JU5JI69G | review/summary: Spinster finds romance in Venice | review/text: The title pretty much says it.  I am a sucker for romantic films from the 50's starring iconic stars falling in love in beautiful, foreign places.  Some of them hold up (I recently saw The King and I which still had all of its original magic and charm.  Not so long ago I saw Grace Kelly and Cary Grant fall in love in Monaco in To Catch a Thief---still wonderful! Then there is the still enchanting  Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.)  This film....not so much.<br /><br />The really good part is the photography of Venice in  all its sunny magnificence.  The really bad part is the plot.  Perhaps it was meaningful in the 50's and perhaps it suffers from the many films which has borrowed its ideas.  (eg.  firecrackers exploding in the sky to signal sex).  Also it seems that the myth of the repressed or desperate American women who travel to warm climates for romance is getting a little moth-eaten.<br /><br />Here it is Katherine Hepburn, as a forty-ish secretary from Ohio, who saves her money for her trip of a lifetime, one in which she hopes she'll discover "what she's been missing."  She plays innocent for a while but it's quite obvious to the audience that what she's after is Romance.  She mopes around miserably while watching happy couples pass by.  She seems to drink quite a bit.  She is attracted by a crimson goblet in an antique store.  (The film is not really subtle with the symbolism, but again, this was made in the 50's.)<br /><br />The owner of the antique store provides just what she's been looking for--the Liberator of her repressed Libido.  He's played by Rosanno Brozzi, who, I guess was considered quite the Latin Lover in his day.  What he sees in her is hard to tell, as she is really frumpy in her  long shirtwaist dresses and frizzy hair, all bound up on top of her head. Maybe it's her ankles, or her availability.<br /><br />He pursues, she protests, he persists.  It doesn't take long till she melts in his arms.  She discovers to her horror that he is married, but it only takes a few minutes of explanation---he and his wife have an "arrangement"---to assuage her Midwest conscience and she again melts into his arms, (after a manicure and new clothes) and has The Best Time of Her Life.<br /><br />Of course she does have to use her return ticket and leaves him before he dumps her, which, being fairly bright, she knows will happen.<br /><br />But hopefully, although she wears the same dumpy brown jumper she arrived in, she has  apparently had her flame lit and maybe she'll go back to Akron a changed woman.  Well, at least she has her home movies and her red glass goblet.  As for Rosanno, well, there are always new tourists arriving daily; he'll cope.<br /><br />Hepburn fans, and they are a loyal bunch, will love her in anything.  I never much got the charm of Rosanno Brozzi---he's no Marcello Mastroanni, but if he still has fans aroung, they'll be pleased.  For me, the only good reason to see it is the stunning photography.

I defy anyone not to weep at the scene where Rob Hall speaks to his wife as he lies dying.<br /><br />I have seen it three times now, and have read the book upon which it is based, and others. I appreciate that the film may be a partial view, based as it is on one man's account, and I agree that at times it can be confusing, but the story and action are so strong that they carry you through.<br /><br />As most of the audience won't be expert mountaineers, and as anyone interested can find out as much as they like by reading the books, I think this film is an admirable success.

 | product/productId: 1559408677 | review/userId: A2BHRZHZONOXSU | review/summary: Ultimate Edition? Hardly... | review/text: IMPORTANT NOTE: This review was written for the Dragon Dynasty DVD VERSION of this film, but thanks to Amazon's bizarre practise of porting reviews from one product platform to another product platform with no regard to differences between them, there's a good chance you're reading this review on the Blu-ray listing for this title. Having seen the Blu-ray version, I can say with absolute certainty that it is only a VERY MODEST improvement over the DVD in terms of picture quality. While I have neither the time nor inclination to review the Blu-ray, I would direct you to the extremely informative review at DVD Beaver (dot com), and concur 100% with the "disappointment" label given this release. What is most puzzling is the loss of the trailer gallery available on the earlier DVD set. Strange that a format that actually holds more is, in this case, used to hold less!<br /><br />The remainder of this review is for the previous DVD special edition, which the new Blu-ray does little to better:<br /><br />There should be no doubt that HARD BOILED is a phenomenal action picture, one of the best ever produced in Hong Kong. Much has been written all over the internet about it in the years since it was released direct-to-video in North America in the very early 90's.<br /><br />Now, some 16 years later, through any number of flawed prints, alternate edits, crummy dubs and subtitles of varying quality, not to mention several PREVIOUS special editions on DVD, each with their own pros and cons, the chance to do right by this film in so many ways is, typically, blown by the Weinstein machine and their cabal of Hong Kong cinema experts.<br /><br />Oh, sure, this disc is watchable, and considering there is now a generation of teenagers out there who weren't even BORN when this was released, I'm sure there will be new fans made from watching this film. But the film ain't the problem for the rest of us.<br /><br />Who in their right minds, in 2007, puts DUBTITLES on a "premium" special edition of possibly one of the most important Hong Kong motion pictures of all time. DUBTITLES based on a dub that was made, what, 16 years ago now? That dubbed version was indeed responsible for bringing a great many western fans into the fold, but that doesn't mean we liked it. Or any dubbing for that matter. Just because HARD BOILED is over half action sequences doesn't automatically mean the dialogue sequences are unworthy of even a moderately more accurate translation of WHAT THE CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY SAYING IN CANTONESE. Instead, they appear to have paid the receptionist a few bucks to type the original dub script verbatim into the subtitle stream.<br /><br />Thankfully, far superior subtitles are still available on other, BETTER DVD releases of the film. Some of which even have an image where Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Chow Yun-fat DON'T look like they've put on about 50 pounds!! I'm no expert on aspect ratios and the like, but I know enough, and I've seen enough Chow and Leung movies to know that they don't quite look like this in real life. Gotta wonder who's bright idea it was to CROP the movie, then STRETCH it back to the proper aspect ratio. I can think of a few people who probably figured no one would notice, or if they did, that they'd just be the usual internet pedants.<br /><br />If that's what I am, so be it, but for god's sake, you think a label that so eagerly wants to be viewed as the top shelf for Hong Kong and Asian movies, would actually start treating those very products with some REAL respect. But then again, look what they did with their "edit" of the Protector. Laughable. And to hear the commentator on that one JUSTIFY the cuts tells me where he really stands when it comes to his paymasters' wishes. This edition of HARD BOILED is another clue.<br /><br />If I were just reviewing the film, I'd give it 5 stars. But since this is a DVD review, and I managed to find one at a store that broke street date, AND I'm now out about [...] for something I now know I DIDN'T NEED TO UPGRADE, the best I can muster is (a generous) two stars, largely for the interviews on the second disc, which are not bad, and the location tour, which is not without interest.<br /><br />The commentary on the other hand, while not a total write-off, obviously, offers SOME interesting tidbits that are tangentially related to the film itself, but to save a list of errors and 'best guesses' that would make your eyes glaze, just dig up a copy of the old Fox Lorber DVD from and listen to this film's CREATORS, John Woo and Terence Chang contradict Dragon Dynasty's commentator on several occasions. Or listen to the track on the Criterion edition of this title, where they do the same thing (though in fairness, the Fox Lorber track may have been a longer, uncut version of the Criterion one, only minus Roger Avery and Dave Kehr). John Woo and Terence Chang MADE the film, so who should you trust? A self-anointed expert? Sure, he means well enough, and he knows more than I do (which is why I'm a lowly peon who doesn't do commentaries ;)  ), but a lot of the less film-specific stuff on this track feels awfully familiar...<br /><br />Watch this disc for the movie (in Plump-o-Vision) and the interviews. Then do a little surfing to find one of the superior international versions if you really feel you need an "ultimate edition" in your collection, 'cause this ain't it.
 | product/productId: 6302226899 | review/userId: A3MV1KKHX51FYT | review/summary: When Johnny Came Marching Home Again | review/text: The Best Years of Our Lives<br /><br />Captain Fred Derry is trying to get a flight back home to Boone City. He meets two others from his home town, one who lost his hands. All that Derry wants is a good job for his future. They see hundreds of airplanes that will be junked for scrap. The ride down Main Street shows hundreds of small businesses. [Most would be gone in another generation.] Homes have big porches. Elevators have operators. The film shows the homecoming for each veteran, and the reaction of each to their new situation. There is an interesting comparison of military rank to neighborhood. Would that ever occur again?<br /><br />After a night out their adjustment to civilian life continues. No one finds any tragedies at home. Fred's old owner-operated pharmacy is now part of a chain. Al is offered a promotion to Vice President in charge of Small Loans at the Cornbelt Bank. Homer can practice firing his .22 in his backyard [what freedom they had!]; Wilma still loves him. Homer can't accept the reality of his prosthetic devices. Fred has nightmares from his war experiences. VP Al judges loan applicants by their character, not their collateral. At the Union Club VP Al expresses confidence in the bank's future and small loans to people. Fred's wife complains about the change in Fred's personality since the war. Peggy has ideas for her future, and this surprises her parents. Al talks to Fred to straighten out things. A reactionary shows up at the store and argues with Homer; Fred settles the argument and quits his job. Wilma shows that she has the right stuff.<br /><br />Fred's wife has decided she wasted the best years of her life, and will change her status. Fred knows when it is time to bail out. Fred visited a junk yard to remember the past, and finds a future: he has a `can do' attitude. At Homer's wedding Millie worries about Al's drinking. Homer and Wilma will live happily ever after. There will be a future for Peggy and Fred too.<br /><br />This film provides snapshots of life in 1945 America, as seen by Hollywood. The success of this film shows it was acceptable to the American public. It was the greatest success for independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn. This complete film is much better than the censored version shown on broadcast TV.

The incredible cinematography, the awesome Ennio Morricone score, and the shockingly brilliant casting of Henry Fonda as one of the most cold-blooded villians ever to light up the big screen combine to produce a true movie masterpiece.  Sergio Leone's meticulous attention to detail produced a film which is, at once, both a visual work of art and an exciting action picture.  Please add my name to the list of people who are anxiously awaitng its release on DVD, and PLEASE use whatever influence you have to encourage its availability with Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS audio.  The soundtrack is the best I have ever heard, and it would be an awful shame to release it in a lesser format.

 | product/productId: 6301942981 | review/userId: A1O8AWZ5QADQT7 | review/summary: All these years later, still a fabulous film | review/text: Julia Roberts and Richard Gere magnetize the entire film and pull you into a fantasy land where dreams do come true.  I understand the naysayers, but this film is not about Julia Roberts being a hooker.  Obviously, some people find that horribly offensive.  This movie is about love, gaining self-respect and believing in yourself (Kit . . . "take care of YOU").  It's a feel good film about pursuing your dreams.  Obviously, if some 14 year old decides she wants to be a hooker when she grows up so she can meet her prince charming, she needs some serious guidance.  Yet I highly doubt even most 14 year old's are that stupidly literal about a film such as this.  I'm 50 years old and, you know what?  A LOT of my dreams HAVE come true in ways I never would have expected, including romatically.  So there;0).

By the end of the movie, I did not condone what was done, but I understood.  How many of us know people who came back after fighting for their country, and they are working jobs that suck, and living a tough life.  That's pretty much the message I got from the film.  I watch this movie about once a month, I like it that much.  Chris Tucker had a role in this film that makes you stand up and take notice.  I would love to see him in more dramas in the future.  He could do the roles.
 | product/productId: 6302450187 | review/userId: AR1T36GLLAFFX | review/summary: An entertaining time | review/text: The plot is a bit predictable.  You'll probably guess most of the plot twists before they come. The demented nanny.  The saintly, stuttering black handyman whom she has fired.  The mousy, asthmatic wife.  The clueless husband.  There are sadly, few surprises in this movie.<br /><br />So why four stars instead of zero or one?  Well, Rebecca DeMornay is superbly chilling in the role.  She's absolutely believable as the nanny who has her very real reasons for going off the deep end.  (In fact one of the few surprises in the film is that she is given a solid reason for flipping out.  I sort of hate to say this, but I was kind of rooting for her over the very mousy Annabella Sciorra.)<br /><br />The scene with DeMornay in the woman's bathroom at the arboretum was great.  Her character, Payton, was quite soulless, and she made you feel her chill.  She never plays a false note.  The stares she gave could stop people in their tracks.  You really do think this woman could kill.<br /><br />Recommended.  Worth watching if you want a good, entertaining.  And DeMornay's character will stick with you for quite some time.  She's that good (and beautiful, to boot.)  Because of her story, you actually start rooting for her, except that she's gone around the bend a bit.
 | product/productId: 6302206294 | review/userId: AAW58LG72PG7I | review/summary: Costner's Robin Too Passive | review/text: The final verdict on ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is that Kevin Costner is no Errol Flynn.  True, it is often unfair to compare a remake to a hugely successful original, especially since the goals of each are sometimes divergent.  In this case, however much I tried to see Costner's thoughful and intellectual Robin Hood as the driving force, I still harkened back to the sheer exuberance that Flynn invested his part.  Further, I could have lived with and even enjoyed on its own merits Costner's low key performance had it not been for the over the top campy performance of Alan Rickman as the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham.  With each time Rickman mugged for the camera, he became the focus of that scene.  Even when Costner and Rickman met several times, Costner's Robin Hood took a decided back seat to Rickman's Sheriff. As I compared Costner to Flynn, so did I compare Rickman to Claude Rains in THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST.  Rains's Sheriff was as equally oily as Rickman's, but Rains had the good sense to let Basil Rathbone do the sword play.  In PRINCE OF THIEVES, Rickman tries to do too much and to the extent that he succeeds the film reduces Costner to little more than a talky bystander.<br /><br />Still, PRINCE OF THIEVES is enjoyable as spectacle even if Rickman steals the show on too many occasions.

 | product/productId: 0783223145 | review/userId: A2I87OY16UP61R | review/summary: I feel a lot of distance | review/text: Of a three hour long movie this is the line that drew my attention the most, as I consider this movie to be about the war aftermath rather than the war itself. People who went to this war became its very victims, as they were used for the whims of others.<br /><br />  This flawed yet beautiful movie is divided in three parts: before, during and after Vietnam war, the happy-go-lucky attitude, the horror and disillusion. Many have complained about the overlength of the wedding scenes, but I guess it was Cimino's intention, as he first allows the viewer to get to know the main characters in order to "make him suffer" more later in the movie.<br /><br />  What comes after the wedding and the last time the guys were hunting together is much more controversial. As to this movie's realism, some of the things that bother me the most are the morality of Michael Cimino's attitude to his story-telling, his one sided approach of the war and his politically correct treatment of the Vietnamese: all the atrocities portrayed in this film are committed by the Vietcong. As for the highly controversial Russian roulette contests scenes, which by the way are some of the most dramatic and most beautiful scenes ever to be captured by a camera, although they never really took place, they can be justifiable. The whole thing can be viewed as a metaphor, trying to depict the absurdity of the Vietnam War, as the whole movie itself is not a realistic, but a surrealistic work. Even the landscape is surrealistic. But even so, the question remains moot.<br /><br />  The best thing in this movie is certainly the acting. De Niro gives one of his best performances ever, especially in the Vietnam scenes and later on. When he comes back home he feels a tremendous void: he has serious problems connecting to people, as the war experience was too mind-boggling for him to even try to talk about it. He makes you feel the devastation that touched America and how this war scarred forever its psyche. Chris Walken deserved the best supporting actor academy award he won that year for his part in this movie: his portrayal of the one descending slowly into madness is at least memorable. Meryl Streep is fantastic too: the chemistry between her and De Niro is obvious, but what I liked the most about her performance is her quiet inner nervousness, her inner trauma as she struggles between her loyalty to Nicky and her attraction to Michael and her need for some consolation. Savage and Cazale are excellent too.<br /><br />  The closing scene is one of the saddest I've ever seen in a movie, as they all sing a patriotic song in order to try and regain the natural feeling they once proved, all wrecked beyond repair, realizing that something has gone forever.<br /><br />  All in all a masterpiece, although a flawed film, but frankly, how many flawless masterpieces have you seen in your life?
 | product/productId: 1404948244 | review/userId: A8GQ6H40JOWYQ | review/summary: surprisingly substantive and funny | review/text: I really expected the first 15 minutes to be humorous with cute jokes based on the obvious contrasts between the looks and demeanor of Tommy Lee Jones and a group of big-time cheerleaders who are all female, but it stays funny and actually has substance woven into it.  I am not a professional reviewer so I can't dissect this movie to explain why it works.  Could it be that Tommy Lee Jones and Ann Archer are good at their chosen careers?  While certainly cute and funny, the cheerleaders were just serious enough not to make a mockery of the movie's concept.<br /><br />True, the story line seems to blend the babes in the pom-pom girl team and the gymnists of the cheerleader squad into one group, but that's Hollywood.<br /><br />And, just for the record:  the school in question is NEITHER Texas A&M nor Texas State (both fine schools) but the University of Texas...Longhorns...that's why there are longhorns painted on the girls' cheeks and just about everywhere the camera points in Austin, Texas, where the campus of the University of Texas is located.  That's why so many people in the movie are seen holding their hands in an otherwise very curious display of fingers.  And, that's why the colors burnt orange and white are awash on screen.<br /><br />For those outside of Texas or those who don't like college sports, this movie would probably rate 3-stars, but I gave it 4 stars to account for a 1-star bonus directed to all those viewers who do like college athletics or have any interest in Texas or Big 12 programs.

I came away from it feeling that there are decent people in this world and that we are not all disappearing into the obscurity of just a name on a piece of paper.  <p>The story follows Jerry Maguire, played by Tom Cruise, falling from  grace working for a sports star agency when he has a flash of inspiration  and takes the moral high ground on the way people should be treat within  the company. His eventual rise to becoming a better person is aided from  the love of woman and her son and the realization that everyone who he  represents should be treated with the same respect.<p>The person that stole  the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh.  This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific  actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The "Show Me  The Money" scene will have you in stitches.<p>This is not a DVD that is to  be bought for it's technical qualities or abundance of extras. All you get  is a static menu with no trailer, character biographies or other extras. In  this day and age of DVD's like "Contact" and "The Matrix" I would have  expected a bit more from a quality movie like this. The picture quality is  good, as is the sound but it certainly won't tax your Dolby Digital  amplifier, but then again it is not expected to.<p>Jerry Maguire is a film  to cuddle up to your partner with and watch on a cold rainy night. It is  funny, poignant and thought provoking. Worth watching at least  once.<p>Steve.

Just consider: <p>A bedridden paraplegic policeman who lives in a chic SoHo loft equipped with state-of-the-art technology and round-the-clock nursing (all this on a  cop's pension) solves a series of preposterous gory murders with the help  of a gorgeous rookie who used to be a supermodel! In the end -of course!-  he alone confronts the bad guy, outsmarts him and gets the girl!<p>No,  wait!; there's more!: A wealthy couple takes a nap in a NYC cab at night,  the girl enters every crime scene with no backup whatsoever (the cops would  mess up the evidence, see -say what?), an abandoned subway station is  discovered just below the Staten Island Ferry pier complete with a derailed  wagon, a hooker lies down on a pool table in a seedy bar while there's  people playing in it and no one complains, the hero deducts the exact  whereabouts of a kidnapping cabbie from a single hundred-year-old bolt  found elsewhere instead of asking who was working a cab that night, and  -you guessed it- the killer can own a Yellow Cab in New York City with no  questions asked! And don't think for a moment I'm giving away the plot;  this is just for starters!<p>Apparently the sreenwriter(?) has never seen a  &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode, and the people who gave favorable  reviews to this turkey either hates thrillers or wouldn't know one from a  Police Academy flick! In fact, the only suspense about it is ...what is  Denzel doing in a bomb like this?<p>P.S.: On top of it all, the photography  is lousy!

 | product/productId: 0792838378 | review/userId: APP5MBH2BSX6I | review/summary: Ambiguity abounds | review/text: This little film is fascinating almost beyond words.  It plumbs beneath the veneer of such subject matter as wealth, liberalism, sexuality, morals, and power, without leaving New York's upper east side except for one scene.<p>Will Smith was just a fresh rappa/prince when he scored this role, and is mesmerizing as a young man of mysterious means and background.  He arrives at the fashionable doorstep of socialites Donald Sutherland & Stockard Channing (Oscar winner in this role, having also won a Tony for her stage version of the same part) and charms them, and us, in ways that surprise them, and us.<p>I really am loath to give away much more than that.  Suffice to say that all the primary actors are perfect beyond words in their roles, and Smith is an absolute revelation, his character blossoming and then unraveling in fascinating ways.  The script from which these characters spring is pure prose, a lovely experience for anyone who loves the language.<p>My only real problems with the film are its sometimes graphic moments in terms of sex and language (although it's admitted that these are jarring and graphic for valid artistic reasons) and the fact that the children of these socialites (and the children of their upper-class friends) are played way, way overly shrill and over the top.  These mar an exceptionally memorable and thoughtful film experience, a rare pleasure for viewers who don't mind films that are heavy on dialogue.
 | product/productId: 6300268861 | review/userId: A347S4NGOA449 | review/summary: Funny! Hilarious! Gut Busting! | review/text: Is such a movie as this one. Bill and Sydney have always starred well as a duo. They're about the only two guys I know that can pull off roles as crooks, turn it into comedy and get away with it. But that takes nothing away from Calvin Lockhart and Harry Bellafonte. Everyone in this movie will have you busting your gut laughing. Bunch of fools (but in a funny way). I guess when you lose a lotto ticket, you go thru a lot trying to get it back. But if these clowns had been where they were supposed to be, instead of partying up at Zenobia's, they wouldn't have found themselves in such a mess. I guess they thought the wives wouldn't know they'd been up to no good.<br /><br />They went from getting robbed, to get beaten up by a 4 foot 10 guy, to getting hooked up with some gangsters to ending up jumping into the river all because they were hard-headed. But it was all good. Nice clean comedy. Own this one. It's well worth being in your collection!

 | product/productId: 6300216454 | review/userId: A2CW9IQAPFEYLM | review/summary: A man at the end of his rope | review/text: There are some things, no matter how bad they might be otherwise, that touch a chord in us somehow and thus gain our admiration. For me, this movie does exactly that. Maybe it's the reminiscing about old ball players and jazz musicians; maybe it's Bunny Berigan's "I Can't Get Started" on the soundtrack; but this depressing and pretentious movie has impressed me ever since I saw it years ago. Jack Lemmon plays a clothing manufacturer who is in trouble financially; he's thinking of torching one of his warehouses for the insurance money, seeing no other way to make it through "another season." He's also fed up with the crummy world he's "forced" to live in and lives more and more in the world of his past (which, he if really thought about it, was probably just as bad). Much in the movie is cliched and phony, but Lemmon rises above it all somehow. Like I said, it touches something in me that's beyond explanation. Despite its flaws I like this movie a lot.
 | product/productId: 0783225989 | review/userId: A2O8XMNIBHZXCE | review/summary: Realistic emotional impact of Viet Nam | review/text: Two decades ago, when my wife and I were driving back home after viewing this movie, she burst into tears.  She told me that she had never before realized what Viet Nam was like.<br /><br />I'm not sure that The Deer Hunter depicted the "real" Viet Nam, because the "real" Viet Nam was different for each of us that served there.  What I can tell you is that The Deer Hunter very truthfully highlighted one simple fact:  no individual who served in Viet Nam came back home the same!<br /><br />Robert De Niro's character, I think, aptly demonstrates one of the changes that the Viet Nam war could produce in its veterans - a renewed appreciation of life itself - especially that of a defenseless buck.  Dressed in the garb of a warrior, De Niro's character wrestled with the transition from war to civilian life from his first few moments home.  Later, in the misty hills of a hunting trip, he made the choice of NOT killing.  Still later, he tried to rescue his best friend, who never left Viet Nam, from his surrealistic opiate hell.<br /><br />Don't watch The Deer Hunter as a mere war movie.  See it as a realistic journey for one young man (against a backdrop of life as usual back home) from the innocence of early adulthood, through a foreign hell of warrior in Viet Nam, and finally the battle to wade through the emotional impact of Viet Nam and to reconcile all three.<br /><br />The Deer Hunter reveals the emotional damage, too-often permanent, that war exacts from its participants.  It should be required watching for our nation's leaders before they decide to send more of our young men into war's particular brand of hell.

There are lots of bonus features on this particular DVD, and a good deal about Hitch himself. Even if you have seen the movie, this is a good addition to your collection.

 | product/productId: 0783222955 | review/userId: A258YDD6553JA2 | review/summary: The Summer We Discovered Life | review/text: Every so often, as surely as night follows day, a film comes along that manages to transport us from our everyday lives and into a time and place that is recalled through memories of better and in a reversal of fortunes, turbulent times. To Kill A Mockingbird is such a film.<p>In a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced. Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.<p>Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and widower, raising two small children, Scout (Mary Badham) and her older brother Jem (Phillip Alford). Into their lives enters a visitor, Dill (John Megna) from Meridian, Mississippi, come to spend two weeks with his Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostley). Macomb is a town with nothing to do and if there were, no money to spend on it. The stage is being set for a life shattering episode that will not go quietly into that good night. <p>Childhood holds its fascinations, its myths, its coming of age and through the eyes of the three children, the audience is allowed to peer into the adult world around them as perceived through the minds and souls of innocence that will be all too easily shattered as time whistles down the track. One of the stories woven so masterfully within its covers is the local urban legend of bogeyman, Boo Radley (Robert Duval), who lives on the same block as the Finch family. In a narration, rather like playing telephone, his persona takes on all the familiar attributes of a raving lunatic, a monster out for blood. His aura becomes the end all for Scout, Jem and Dill as they seek to master the mystery surrounding Boo and the ability to live to tell the tale!<p>Into this world of innocence, a shattering crescendo of complexity wraps itself in the lives of the townspeople in the form of an alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox) by a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). Atticus Finch is called upon to act as counsel for Robinson and in doing so, the stage has been set for a dance with race relations and the exemplary lengths that are gone to in order to allow justice to prevail in the face of malcontent.<p>The performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning. Gregory Peck, as the gentleman lawyer, mired in small town attitudes and thoughts that were so representational in the southern gothic sphere, has collected and held a restrained order to his character, and in the process, he has allowed us all to be on the receiving end of hate as conveyed through the actions of small minds and small people. The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture. They show the absence of preconceived notions, and the guile of beings before the actions of adults can render their world as lost and gone with the shedding of time.<p>James Anderson as Tom Ewell is the complete representation of oily slime as Mayella's father. He embodies all of the hate and prejudice that continues to be harboured to this day in the souls of those who would attempt to wield their vision of the way things should and ought to be. He has a foul baseness that lingers like a bad rash as he attempts to invoke his arguments through drunken bullying and hatred. Collin Willcox as Mayella is excruciatingly convincing as the bored, housebound white woman who tries to tempt Tom Robinson into kissing her and through her actions sets in motion a rollercoaster of tragedy to come. Her speech to the assembled courtroom is superb and as the audience, you feel her anger and resentment at having to be put in such a position, having to lie to save face and what little position she has in the town. Brock Peters as the aforementioned Robinson is equally sure in the allotted time he spends on the screen. There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.<p>Robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled. We have walked a mile in their shoes and been under their skin. Foote worried about being able to do justice to Lee's novel, but he worried for nothing. He has completely evoked an era that now rests behind clouds of dust, blown by the winds of time into oblivion.<p>The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times. Black and white films seem to have had a curse thrust upon them by the younger generation today, as boring and tedious, but through the courtesies extended by Harlan and Emert, we are richer for those perceptions that would harken back throughout the pages of history.<p>Elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework. He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.<p>To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose. No special effects were needed, no huge Hollywood budget, no splashing of a story that had a happy ending for everyone involved. It is an open book into the realities of a world tilting temporarily off its axis, and being brought back on track through the goodness that sits in the hearts, minds and souls of mankind, if given half a chance.<p>See it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.

The screenplay has taken great liberties with the original book, but this is nonetheless a very good movie.<br />The chemistry between Charlton Heston and the venerable Edward G. Robinson is a wonder.  When they are dining on the ill-gotten real food that Charlton's character pilfered from a crime scene he was investigating, you could feel the culinary joy.<br />The movie is a grim interpretation of what our world will be like with unchecked population growth and resource consumption.  Without giving away too much...Soylent Green ain't the Soy-Lentil combination of Harrisons' book....<br />Charlton Heston did some wonderful SciFi flicks in this period.  Be sure to check out the more campy 'Omega Man', and of course 'Planet of the Apes'.

 | product/productId: 0783233477 | review/userId: A1M7RL7S6VBQK2 | review/summary: the love scene | review/text: There isn't much left to say after reading the other reviews.  I would  agree with all of the positives.  It is one of the most beautiful films I  have ever seen.  The nuances of acting by all of the main characters is  sensational, and reduces the need for thick dialogue.  The ending left  something to be desired, but the writers did the best they could  considering the direction the plot had taken.  The best part of the film,  however, was the love scene between Forlani and Pitt.  It was breathtaking  and moving, the angles and lighting were immaculate, and the music is  romantic yet poignant, and I the whole construction nearly brought me to  tears.  It was phenomenal, maybe the best I've ever seen.
 | product/productId: 0790749653 | review/userId: A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0 | review/summary: Classic Film Noir | review/text: This is one of the great film noirs, obviously, and also one of the best film adaptations from a novel. William Faulkner helped write the screenplay, as is mentioned in the officialish review above; having read the novel I can say he truly did an amazingly good job, making thoughtful choices to maintain the tone despite needing to slightly rephrase a number of the novel's seedier sides. <p>It's wonderful how the Marlowe character comes through flawlessly from the novel without sacrificing any plotline or action to speak of. Partly that's the good writing, and partly of course it's Bogie in one of his best turns. He and Bacall were just starting out when this got made, and in a couple of scenes the chemistry is delicious to watch.<p>Everything about this one is superb, though. If you want to see a film noir, this is a great place to start.<p>The DVD is, as is mentioned elsewhere, a great example of how the format can sometimes get past "We included the original trailer" and "We sat around talking about how we did those special effects." The comparison between the released version and the "prerelease" one a year earlier is unusually good fodder for conversation among film buffs, and adds to the experience. There aren't a ton of extras, but the few here are fun.<p>My only quibble would be with the image quality. There are some really superb restorations of a few other black and white classics in this genre -- The Third Man comes to mind -- and at times watching this I wince at the haziness of the images. You won't be too bothered by it, it's not like a bad VHS tape, but it just doesn't have the crispness you think of in a superb DVD.

I loved these movies as a kid, and still enjoy them immensely as an adult. The digital remastering is gorgeous -- the colors are vivid and the picture crisp. The 4th disc of bonus material is also well done. I won't even comment on the films themselves -- quality material that stands the test of time. Classic, action-packed Spielberg. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
 | product/productId: 6300248143 | review/userId: A16QODENBJVUI1 | review/summary: THE Great Female Action Hero and an overall great film | review/text: The second installment in the Aliens saga has been my favorite of the bunch ever since first seeing it. There are multiple reasons for this. For one, being a sequel, there was no need to develop gradually learning about what the situation on the planet is. The plot gets going a lot earlier than in ALIEN. Second, the pace is much faster and intense than in the first. Indeed, this is one of the tensest films ever made. But primarily, ALIENS is the best in the series because the character of Ripley has developed into the best female action role in the history of film. A lot of movies over the years have featured women in action roles, but most of the time, they are not terribly believable. Most of the time, the women look like what they are: actress with model's good looks awkwardly holding a gun. Not Ripley. Although traumatized by her encounter with the alien in the first film, she takes her fear and trauma and channels it into an intense anger and assertiveness. When she sees the indecision and ineptitude of those supposedly in charge of the mission, Ripley is forced to step forward and assert herself. When she does so, she emerges as the greatest female action character ever.<p>Ripley makes this movie. Her sheer courage in doing what she has to do to not only to save herself but the young girl who is the sole survivor on the planet drives her to undertake some amazing feats of courage. Her will drives the film forward, and there are few more extraordinary moments in Sci-fi than when she and the alien queen do battle with Ripley using a mechanized freight handler as a combat weapon. <p>There are so many other excellent things in this film: the great supporting cast, with Lance Hendrickson portraying one of the best androids I can remember seeing in film; the continued superb set design, and the extraordinary action sequences. And has there ever been a greater movie monster than the Alien Queen? <p>The Aliens series is one of the very best, but of those films, this one is the best of the bunch.

 | product/productId: 5553640172 | review/userId: A2NJO6YE954DBH | review/summary: They sent him on a mission and they sent him to fail | review/text: John Wayne did not make a sequel. Even in the John Ford Calvary Trilogy he plays three different characters. Gary Cooper did not make a sequel and neither did Clark Gable. Of course, they had the advantage of living before the Age of Inevitable Sequels. I bring this up only because while I realize Sylvester Stallone would have a lot less money without all the sequels that he made, but I was simply wondering if he would have had a better reputation? "Rocky II" gave us a happier ending than "Rocky," but did that not miss the point of the original? "Rocky III" was a slick thrill ride compared to "Rocky," but did it have more heart?<br /><br />Those rhetorical queries lead us to today's object lesson, "Rambo: First Blood Part II," the 1985 sequel to Stallone's "First Blood" (Part I). The original had the virtue of exploiting the plight of Vietnam vets in a way that was at least sympathetic in contrast to the onslaught of movies and television shows that insisted on making American troops back from Vietnam the replacement for all those aging Nazis as the bad guys. There were some pretty good action sequences as Rambo took on the local cops (especially the one in the forest), and then Stallone got to break his character's stoic silence and launch into a rant about how badly our troops were treated by the government and their fellow citizens when they returned. Then three years later we got "Rambo: First Blood Part II."<br /><br />The title alone tells you that the emphasis is on the character, which we can acknowledge without going off the deep end on how the name has five letters and begins with a "R." The problem, and where the sequel fails compared to the original, is that the script has to find somebody stupid enough to make the mistakes that the hick sheriff did in the original and his sadistic deputy did the first time around. The set up is that Colonel Samuel Troutman (Richard Crenna) gets John Rambo (Stallone) out of prison for a black op to bring back POW's still being held in Vietnam by a sadistic prison camp commandant (William Ghent) and a Russian officer (Steven Berkoff). Rambo is teamed up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson), a former Vietnames freedom fighter, who manages to touch our hero's heart, every during all the excitement. Of course Rambo wants to get the POWs out of the prison camp, but he ends up being betrayed by the guy running the operation (Charles Napier) and his henchman (Martin Kove) as once again American foreign policy rears its ugly head. This means that Rambo is going to have to accomplish his mission regardless of what real echelons clowns might want.<br /><br />Obviously the situation here is contrived, but it is the rare sequel that does not try to stick to the original proven formula as much as possible. The problems are that it is hard to believe that these people would go out of their way to bring a living killing machine as a loose cannon on a secret mission like this and that the film finds its relevance in keeping alive the idea that the Vietcong have been keeping American prisoners ever since the war ended. "Rambo: First Blood Part II" served as a rallying point for those who believed that to be the case, which I find being tantamount to adding insult to injury. If you accept the premise of the plot then the film has a certain power, but I cannot but consider the whole thing to be just too manipulative and exploitative.

 | product/productId: 630173467X | review/userId: A1BG19L6SA12RS | review/summary: Schlocky Fifties horror at its &quot;best&quot;. | review/text: Let's face it, this is not a good film.  But it is undeniably fun, due to the outrageous situations, ripe dialog, and at least one good acting performance.  As the lecherous and totally rotten mad scientist, Donald Murphy is very effective, and it is surprising that he was not in more films.  And as the sincere elderly scientist, Felix Locher is terrible, but enthusiastic.  Director Richard Cunha injects a few nice touches here and there, but you have to look closely to catch them.  And did anyone on Earth ever watch a film like this in the hope of hearing and seeing two crummy rock-&amp;-roll numbers performed?  The most amusing moments are Dr. Frank's instant &quot;explanations&quot; to conceal the fact that he has built a monster in the basement, and that it is now walking around the neighborhood.  (The one about a lost puppy is priceless.)  Worth a look for horror fans.
 | product/productId: 6301179544 | review/userId: A2X3IT1PUWYMQY | review/summary: Needs to be on DVD! | review/text: In a time where masked slashers ruled the eighties, seeing a horror film as original as PHANTASM II was a rarity. Here we have a sequel that not only is equal to the original, but completely reinvents itself from the ground up with quicker pacing, scarier visuals, and an all-around more polished production.<p>Yes, the first PHANTASM is a classic, and in the tradition of ALIENS, here we have a radically different- yet equally satisfying- action/horror romp. So why no DVD?!?<p>We all like to complain about what films aren't available on DVD, but I feel stronger about this flick than any other. If only good ol' MGM would step in and buy the rights to 2 &amp; 3 and put together a nifty box set.
