 With his George Raft-ian vocal inflections, flaring nostrils, and perpetual scowl Tierney is intimidating enough, but Tierney was a legendary bad-boy off-screen and I'm not sure whether the one-note tough guy acts were conscious decisions or simply an extension of his personality.
 Had I encountered Borat, I would've shot the *ish with him like one of `ATL-ian Dirty South shawties,' or chuckled at his antics like the meteorologist.
&quot;Arthur&quot;-ian realism.

 Sure, yes, it's just a movie, but it is a historical fact that for about 20 centuries, jerk-wad x-ians have been, shall we say, less than awesome when dealing with people that they don't like, or who make them uncomfortable, or who challenge their mythological dogma, or who, for that matter, eat red meat on Fridays.
 Atheists, Pagans, Wiccans, whomever, I'm going to pull for them as opposed to x-ians any day.

The show is reminiscent of Seinfeld, with characters causing each other problems due to Seinfeld-ian misunderstandings.

Dick-ian premise of a company that can selectively erase memories (the company's name is "Lacuna").
And that ending...Typical Welles-ian mischievousness.
 He takes to country life in his uniquely Shore-ian way, horrifying just about everyone in the state of South Dakota.
 But overall a great movie with an young hero who saves the day in the truest Spielberg-ian tradition.
 "The Fountain" is one of those broad scoping epic stories that felt eerily Kubrik-ian with its style, but purely Aronofsky with its imagery.

if not for the bleak social commentary, if not for the heady tibalt-ian presence of lou jacobi or the glorious chaos-in-the-weeds direction of first time director alan arkin, if not for the unforgettable vincent gardenia performance, buy this for the "righteous" 20 minutes that donald sutherland blazes the screen in one of the funniest supporting roles of all time.

 Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.
 And I'll be darned if their aren't some fabulous music videos with soulful music and classic Russell-ian touches:  lovers by the sea side, a dancer on a gravestone to name a few.
The opening scenes in the house have an uneasy, Kubrick-ian air about them (the walls are white and sterile-looking, and the film is almost entirely void of any instrumental score or musical cues), but it is hard to imagine even Kubrick coming up with something as unsettling as what comes next.

An A+ recommendation for families to watch together.<br /><br />For me, a young 30s old male Christ-ian, this movie had been therapeutic (even contemplative or meditative) because of all the prejudices, biases, subjective thought-process, and baggage, that I carry as a human being.

or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters.
So I knew going in that this was essentially a 2-hour love letter to all things Spielberg-ian, much less classic Spielberg when he could do no wrong, so I was even more psyched!
