review/summary: GREAT MOVIE FOR  KIDS EXCEPT FOR THE F BOMB,
review/text: Four somewhat geeky jr. high kids opt to make a zombie movie. Joe (Joel Courtney) is one of them. His mother has recently died and his dad (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy who is semi-understanding. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the brains behind the film. Alice (Elle Fanning) agrees to help them with the movie. After midnight, she drives the foursome to the scene. She doesn't have a license and is worried because the deputy's son is with them. Joe promises not to tell. One boy, Cary, has a love for fire and fireworks. Alice's father (Ron Eldard) gets in trouble with the law. Her relationship with Joe is not welcomed by him. This develops into a background Romeo and Juliet scenario, something for the young teen girl appeal.<br /><br />As they are rehearsing a scene at the station, a train is coming down the tracks. Charles scrambles to get a film clip of the train while shooting the scene. Then it happens: a white pick-up truck speeds by the train. There is a wreak. The kids panic and run for their lives as RR cars explode all around them. When the smoke clears they take a quick headcount. There are things which look like a white Rubik's cubes all around them.<br /><br />Charles recognizes the driver of said white truck; it is his fourth period biology teacher, Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman, a black man with a PhD. in biology teaching middle school in white suburban Lillian, Ohio). In his near dying breath the teacher instructs the kids not to say anything or else they and their families will be hunted down and killed! As GI Joe shows up at the scene, the kids grab their equipment and speed out of there...and they take one of the cubes.<br /><br />The Air Force has taken charge of the clean up. The town's people are kept away and in the dark. Then weird things start to happen...Sheriff goes missing, dogs go missing, car engines go missing, microwaves go missing. There is clearly a "monster" thing on the loose, but the camera doesn't let us see it, very similar to many of the Jurassic Park/ Predator scenes. I wish I had seen this on IMAX. There are a number of scenes where things suddenly "jump out at you." This always makes it fun for a bunch of kids at the theater.<br /><br />Spielberg/ Adams bring out the best in the child actors making them very convincing and realistic. The humor is pointed at kids. When Alice asks how to be a zombie, Joe tells her to act like their English teacher. The movie contains numerous anachronisms: Rubik's cube and Walkman came out in 1980 while the movie takes place in 1979. Elle Fanning is asked to play a number of different parts in this film, and she does them all well. I felt like I was watching her audition tape.<br /><br />At some point in time the hippie (store clerk who tries to sell Charles pot) lets out a WTF. Here we have a film clearly aimed at kids and they drop the F-bomb in it. There was absolutely no need for it. They made the rating unwatchable for the target audience which is also financially irresponsible.<br /><br />5 stars for middle school kids who outwit the military and save the day/ 3 stars for adults who sit through it.

review/summary: The Goonies for the new millenium!
review/text: This was a great movie. The plot involves some young teens who go on an a mysterious and amazing adventure. There are also quite a few bits of humor in the film for both adults and kids. There is also plenty of action.<br /><br />This movie is rated PG-13, which surprises me, mainly because of the language. Apparently the word sh*t is not a profanity anymore. Just be aware of this if watching this with your kids. Other than that word being used repeatedly, it is completely fine for family movie night.<br /><br />This movie really reminded me of the Goonies movie from the 1980's, except instead of a pirate theme Super 8 is centered around, well, I don't want to give it away and ruin it. You'll have to go see it for yourself. 5 stars!

review/summary: Had potential for 5 stars, but faded into an ET clone at end
review/text: As everybody knows by now, SUPER 8 was kind of a homage to Spielberg film by Abrams,<br /><br />At the beginning, I was liking it much more than I expected and was really enjoying the 70's era vintage vibe and the story of young kids ................. BUT ............... as the movie went along it became clear it was TOO CLOSE to being a thinly disguised remake of E.T.<br /><br />This became less of a homage and more of a "by the numbers" plot re-work bordering on a flagrant remake with a slightly darker tone.<br /><br />Up until the 50 minute mark, I felt SUPER 8 was going to be a 4.5- 5.0 star movie, but from about 55 minutes onwards it started to fall apart and fade and lost its charm and became basically gave up trying to even disguise the fact it was remaking E.T.<br /><br />As with most critics of the film, the last 10 minutes (ENDING) was very weak and falls flat compared to the rest of the the film.<br /><br />The kid actors (and other actors) did a great job.<br />The set and wardrobe people did a great job.<br /><br />As mentioned above ...... for the first 2/3 of the movie, it was on track to be almost a 5 star rating ............. but then it became TOO FORMULAIC and predictable and seemed TOO CLOSE to E.T. and many other similar movies.<br /><br />Also the last 1/3 of the movie is where the plot holes became very obvious and the logic of the plot falls apart with inconsistencies.<br /><br />Entertaining to watch and much respect for those who worked on the film, but not one we will add to our DVD collection or ever watch again in the future.

review/summary: A Powerhouse Movie That Doesn't Avoid Tenderness
review/text: Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film.  It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.<br /><br />The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher.  It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax.  In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.<br /><br />Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee.  Joel Courtney is outstanding in his role and the supporting cast is excellent. Grady Harp, December 11

review/summary: Thank You Abrams & Spielberg
review/text: There is no doubt that this movie was made in honor of Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams and his co-horts say it in so many ways during their commentary and throughout the featurettes.<br /><br />Set in a small Ohio town in 1979, a group of pre-teen friends set out to make their zombie movie on a super 8 camera. While filming near the train station, a truck plows onto the tracks and causes the entire train to derail. This train was carrying a life-form. A life-form that is captured on their film.<br /><br />While the military come in to contain the situation, the kids discuss what they are going to do.<br /><br />The movie is trademark Abrams - so many lens flares - with a strong mix of Spielbergian storytelling - focus in on a group of people thrown into extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />Kyle Chandler does a fantastic job as the town's deputy. The other actors keep the interest between peeks at the creature.<br /><br />Speaking of the creature, you never really get a good look at the thing. Even at the end, when you typically get the full views of monsters, things are kept in the dark. And that is because the monster really isn't the point of this movie.<br /><br />There are critics who didn't like this movie because they thought it would be something akin to Cloverfield instead of focusing on kids. But this is a fulfilling movie in the spirit of when making movies and watching them were fun.<br /><br />This is such a good movie. Like the Goonies, this one will be quoted for a long time.

review/summary: E.T. Meets Cloverfield
review/text: The problem I always have with critically acclaimed movies is that my expectations are so high the movie can't ever live up to my expectations. On the other hand, sometimes I'll pick up a movie I have no knowledge of and have read nothing about and I'll love it. I also find that on a second viewing, I like the critically acclaimed movies more than I did on the first viewing. The letdown has passed, and I get more into the movie for what it is, not for what I expected it to be.<br /><br />So here's the cover hype. Is Super 8 "the years most thrilling movie"? No. Is it "an instant classic"? No. But it is, in my opinion, a really good movie that just misses, and it's hard to put your finger on why. The acting is fine, and the kids are engaging. Special effects are right on, and the subplots work their way into the storyline without becoming cumbersome. And the kids are remarkable, even more so after watching the special features about them. The leads never acted before? It's mind boggling.<br /><br />You can instantly make a comparison to E.T. (Kids & an Alien). But this picture has a totally different feel to it. The kids aren't as innocent, and the Alien isn't as sweet & helpless. They do try to pull a 360 on that fact at the end of the movie, but after raining death and destruction on the town for almost two hours, it's pretty hard to swallow. And there are some really special moments in this film. My favorite is watching Elle Fanning at the train station rehearsing her lines, and the faces on the other actors as they realize how good she is.<br /><br />So you can see the problem here, nothing but good things to say about the movie, and yet, it just misses. Why? If anyone was holding me down, and needed an answer, I might just have to say that although I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams (really), maybe the movie would have been better served if Spielberg had occupied the directors chair. Maybe the little thing this movie needed was a touch of Spielberg's magic.<br /><br />4 stars for the movie, and the fact that I will watch this, I'm sure, more than a few more times down the road. It is engaging and fun, and so I do recommend this for a purchase. If you lower your expectations just a tad, you will enjoy it. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Fun, Action-Packed Adventure
review/text: While filming a zombie horror film on Super 8, a group of young kids witness a terrifying train crash. But the crash was not an accident. Soon, the Air Force arrives and it's clear they have a dangerous secret they're trying to keep when they begin lying to the local town and strange phenomenon occurs.<br /><br />The story mostly follows the young filmmakers, starring Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. All of the children do an amazing job of bringing heart and a sense of wonder and humor to this thrilling story. I don't think the trailers did the film justice this summer. I didn't even bother going to the theater to watch, as the trailers didn't show any of the actual story. I regretted missing it later, after hearing friends' glowing reviews.<br /><br />JJ Abrams and Spielberg teamed up to make an impressive science fiction thriller. The backdrop of the 70s is realistically low-tech, with a similar feel to the classic 1977 Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Though, Super 8 is much more fast-paced and full of action-packed, adventure.  The mystery and suspense builds to an exciting conclusion. During the credits, we are able to watch the kids' clever "homemade" zombie film, which made sitting through the credits not only bearable, but fun.<br /><br />The Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contents include:<br />Blu-ray:<br />- Commentary by writer/director J.J. Abrams, producer Bryan Burk and cinematographer Larry Fong<br />- Behind-the-Scenes Featurettes:<br /> * The Dream Behind Super 8<br /> * The Search for New Faces<br /> * Meet Joel Courtney<br /> * Rediscovering Steel Town<br /> * The Visitor Lives<br /> * Scoring Super 8<br /> * Do You Believe in Magic?<br /> * The 8mm Revolution<br />- Deconstructing the Train Crash<br />- Deleted Scenes<br /><br />DVD:<br />- Feature Film<br />- Digital Copy

review/summary: "Super 8"-The best Spielberg movie Spielberg never made
review/text: "Super 8" is the best Spielberg movie that Spielberg never made (or at least the best since "Stand By Me"). J.J. Abrams has proven to be something of a film and TV chameleon able to imitate the stuff he liked from his youth while also adding something new and unique about which makes it like good comfort food--it's familiar but not TOO familiar. There are some minor problems with the third act of the film but, on the whole, this throw back bit of entertainment recalls what Spielberg (and even Rob Reiner did so well with "Stand By Me" the OTHER best film that Spielberg never made)did well before he became a "serious" artist; Abrams creates compelling characters with nicely detailed teenagers and although the adults are a little less well developed, they are pretty well done.<br /><br />Set in the late 1970's, "Super 8" follows a group of kids making a zombie movie that they are going to enter in a Super 8 film competition. The kids witness a train crash while filming at an old train station and SOMETHING comes out of one of the cars. This thing begins taking people from the down, stealing microwaves and other devices. When the military show up, it's pretty clear that something BIG has gone wrong.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is very much a demo quality Blu-ray. Colors pop, detail is remarkably sharp and abundant (well, except for the Super 8 footage some of which was actually shot on 16mm so they could add visual effects--by the way the Super 8 movie is at the conclusion during the titles and is a chuckle particularly if you were from that generation that made their own little movies).<br /><br />Audio is positively stunning with a lossless mix.<br /><br />Special features are quite good-- we get deleted scenes (all in HD) as well as a series of featurettes covering the train wreck sequence from conception to execution showing us various stages of completion and featuring Abrams, the visual effects superiors, etc. We also get a digital copy (it's a digital download that you need the code sheet for which is inside) and a DVD copy of the film. There are also eight featurettes that focus on the creation of the film from the story to the final product. Finally we get an engaging commentary track by J.J. Abrams but do yourself a favor and listen to it AFTER you watch the movie because there are spoilers and, of course, a lot of info on the making of the film that might prove distracting.<br /><br />If you enjoyed early Spielberg films from the 1980's like "Close Encounters of The Third Kind" (or even "E.T." although this is scary and there is some profanity to be aware), you'll enjoy "Super 8".

review/summary: Super 8 is a wonderful homage to the Golden Era of Steven Spielberg
review/text: I grew up in the golden Steven Spielberg era of Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and Poltergeist.  If you have read a biography Mr. Spielberg you will find out the story is based on his childhood.  During his early teenage years he used a Super 8 camera(amateur 8mm celluloid film) along with his best friends to direct, edit, and produce his own short films -- almost all of which played only in the kids family rooms.  This is exactly what the film's protagonist does -- (except, of course for the derailment of a super secret military train).<br /><br />Now it is the J.J. Abrams era (with Steven Spielberg producing).  This film is a four star film with an extra fifth star because of the Spielberg nostalgia.  This film also reminds me of Stand By Me (another masterpiece) because it truly captures the mind of a 13 year old perfectly.  Its like a fountain of youth.. only with scary monsters.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is the new Spielberg.  This film, along with 2009's Star Trek are at the top of my "watch over again" pile..<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3HE">The Blob (The Criterion Collection)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVGY">Jaws (Full Screen 30th Anniversary Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O97W5K">Poltergeist [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECACG">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek (Three-Disc Edition)  [Blu-ray</a>]

review/summary: Solid summer film for adults and older kids
review/text: If you want to see an exciting summer movie with a little heart, check out "Super 8". My wife and I saw it the Saturday after the film opened and liked it. It's basically about a couple of sad and troubled kids, Joe (nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) and Alice (the increasingly impressive Elle Fanning) who, along with their friends, get caught up in a dangerous adventure involving a scary monster from outer space.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, what happens with the monster (mild spoiler here) has the happy side effect of helping Joe and Alice become less sad and troubled, as well as improve their relationships with the people important to them. At first I thought the movie's plot was a little too neat, but now I'm coming to appreciate the elegance and craft that went into the movie's screenplay.<br /><br />The film also functions, visually and thematically, as a kind of tribute to the types of movies Steven Spielberg used to produce and/or direct in the 1980's, movies like "E.T.", "Poltergeist", "The Goonies", etc. You know, "kids in danger, but we're pretty sure they'll be okay in the end" movies. "Super 8" was produced by Mr. Spielberg and directed by J.J. Abrams.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good film and worth a trip to the multiplex to see.

review/summary: E.T. with Jaws
review/text: Super 8 is a throwback of sorts to the storytelling that made 80's films like E.T. so compelling. Only this time around there is an added dose of menace. The trailers didn't give too much away, which made the movie seem mysterious and boring at the same time, when it's far from the latter. Basically, a train crashes while a group of kids are filming a zombie movie. Something breaks out of the train and strange things start to happen in the neighboring small town. All of the dogs run away and people go missing. I'm not going to spoil the surprises, since it was a much better experience for me not knowing. The CGI is very good and the all the kid actors are convincing.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams may have stolen a lot of Spielberg's charms here, but it is rare thing these days to watch a summer film that relies on it's story,  acting and nostalgia, rather than just loud explosions and CGI overkill.

review/summary: Outstanding!!
review/text: I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for awhile now and have built high expectations in that time. Luckily, this movie meets those high expectations. This is one movie you should not miss. This movie will surely draw comparisons to ET and other movies but this movie can stand by itself. This movie is for a new generation so the thinking will be different. The acting in this movie is very good. The actors portray their characters perfectly and it looks as if all the actors are completely comfortable in their roles. I wish the acting from the children was a little better but it is passable. It is great to see how they view the world and comprehend all of the events. The directing from J.J. Abrams is great. He makes the movie flow nicely and doesn't rush any parts. Some scenes may be a little overplayed but it doesn't take away from the film. The story is not predictable with the exception of the ending. The story does include a few cliches. The story is, overall, well-written. The dialogue is also well-written. It does not feel like it was written by a 13 year old unlike some other movies. The action is great and well-directed. The action scenes are intense and the derailing train scene is great! The film has a nice pace to it so that it doesn't feel rushed or too slow. One problem I have with the movie is the ending. It is not very good and a little cheesy. Another thing is that I would love to know more about some characters. It would've helped the movie and I feel like we don't know enough about Alice's father. Overall, I recommend that you see this film and form your own opinion. Just make sure that you do not know too much before going in. Super 8 is a great summmer flick with a good story. The film has plenty of good moments that make this one you will not soon forget!

Super 8 left me with a been there done that feeling. It really is a hodge podge of other better movies. Another thing that bothered me was that super 8 Couldnt make up its mind of what audience it was geared towards, The kids in the movie swear like sailors and there are a few monster killings. On the other hand there is cheesy kid friendly sappiness sprinkled throughout,(espeacialy toward the end). Actually I would have rather seen a whole movie about kids in the 70s making a super 8 film with interesting character development and witty dialogue! scrap all the monster stuff.

review/summary: Super 8 on Blu Ray
review/text: Cut to the chase, this movie doesn't know whether it wants to be 'Stand By Me', ET, or Aliens. Rented the blu ray last night.  Bottom line for me, it that it lacks the soul of Stand by Me or the sheer terror of Aliens.  No real explanation for the magnetic powers of the alien stuck on this planet.  The ending is brought to its denouement in the final 2 minutes, the first of which is that all humans, the kids, are not bad,  the second is the military gives up and bye bye alien.  I give it a 5 out of 10.<br />However, both the video and audio were excellent with critical detail found in the black and shadows and reasonable use of surrounds.  The well trailered train wreck was just great.  While it is the quality of the disc I am most interested in before purchasing, I buy only decent storylines and what I consider good movies and I was terribly disappointed in this one as were the 3 others watching with me.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

review/summary: One of the best movies of the year!
review/text: Clearly co-producer Steven Spielberg and writer/director J. J. Abrams wanted to paint a picture-perfect homage to the former's great classics of the 70's and 80's.  This movie succeeds without qualification.  Set in the late 70's in a small Ohio blue collar town, a youngster tries to overcome the accidental death of his mother.  Joe (Joel Courtney) has a rocky relationship with his father and police deputy played by the always good Kyle Chandler.  Joe and his friends are making a student film using a period icon, the super 8 camera.  During the filming late at night they witness the crash of a train that has not only an unusual cause but mysterious after effects.  The crash itself is a highlight, even though railroad cars shooting into the sky like missiles seems highly unlikely.  Still it is well done.  During the events, Joe also begins a flirtation with comely Alice played with unusual tenderness by Elle Fanning.  Make no mistake this girl can act.  Their budding romance is beautiful to watch and one that most of us adults wish we would have had when we were teeny boppers.  The "monster" in the story is kept from view most of the time ala "Jaws" but he eventually surfaces and wrecks carnage all over town.  The ending is a bit tidy, but there is no mistaking this well crafted near masterpiece and was the surprise of the summer.<br /><br />In a second viewing I saw the movie in IMAX. Is it worth the extra money?  No.  The film is obviously larger so we see more skin pores and blemishes, but it doesn't add much to the overall scale of the film.  While the film has an extraordinary train crash, and a violent alien creature, the movie is centered on the relationships between kids crashing puberty.  Joel Courtney as Joe and Elle Fanning as the slightly older Alice are terrific.  "Super 8" shows that a movie primarily about kids (making a home movie), doesn't have to be a "kid movie".  Let Jim Carrey and the Penguins cover that territory.<br /><br />2-11-12:  Blu ray update - The transfer has excellent clarity.  It is crisp and detailed.  Very little grain.  The Dolby TrueHD is spectacular.  The freight train crash will test your equipment.  The audio is reference quality.  The extras are all in HD which is nice.  Included are a DVD and Digital Copy along with deleted scenes, 90 minutes of featurettes and a deconstruction of the train crash.

review/summary: If you think you know what to expect with this movie, think again.
review/text: **** May be mini spoilers below ****<br /><br />I realized a few minutes into this movie that my family and I really had no clue what it was about.  But, I am really glad we went to see it.  The movie is really about a government secrete that comes back to bite this town in the ass.  There is a train that is transporting cretin items.  They have to do with something that government got and did in the late 50s early 60s.  These kids are making a movie for some sort of festival.  They are right by some train tracks.  One boy sees a car go on the tracks, in front of the train.  The train crashes and these things are exposed.  One of the boys takes one of the items.  Soon after things in the town start getting weird.  The power keeps blinking out, the animals run away and people start to die and or go missing.  It may sound simple and it actually is.  Which makes the movie so great.<br /><br />The graphics and or 3D effects look amazing.  But the great thing is, they did do it TO many times.  Even the creatures that come to do what they come to do are mysterious.  You do get to see them, BUT, it seems like every time you see one, you only see a part of it, or there is a lot of smoke or something else around to impair your vision of the creature.  They could have over did the things.  Making you see the entire thing over and over and over again.  The fact that they did not, makes the movie even better.  You really get the feeling that your watching a movie from the 70s or 80s when you are watching the film.  It had a very E.T. feel.  Also, the kids in the movie are amazing.  When I looked them up on IMDB, I was shocked at their ages.  Some amazing acting by great actors.  They really made the movie.  When you leave the theater or turn the TV off you will have a lot of answers.  But it may even put a few questions in your mind as well.  I am really excited about getting this on blu ray when it is released.  I will get to share it with my whole family.<br /><br />One last thing.  I am 26 and this movie really made me feel like I was 8 years old.  I felt the same way I did when I walked out of E.T.  Go see the movie.  It will make you feel great.

If you have a good audio system, crank it to watch.

review/summary: An Amazing Train Crash Scene. ...That's About It...
review/text: A vastly overrated outing from both overrated director J.J. Abrams and has-been Steven Spielberg, this film has gotten about 95% of its success on those two names alone. Therefore, for the sake of a non-bias review for yourself, simply forget (as hard as it may be for the average American), FORGET that this movie has any connection whatsoever with J.J. and Ol' Steve. Take the film for its own right, and you'll see that this is perhaps the most overrated film of 2011. If you remember the teaser trailers leading up to its release, you'd say they were vastly vague, and revealed almost nothing except for creepy music and a lot of darkness. There is a reason for this, it was an attempt to create a buzz for this film because the filmmakers knew they had nothing to really work with. Any other type of trailer would've simply revealed every details about the movie in a matter of 2 minutes. Because, honestly, that's all the time you need to reveal every plot device this film actually offers.<br /><br />The film stars a group of no-name teenage actors who are growing up in the late 1970's, they all are in the middle of creating a low-budget zombie film when a train station scene changes their lives (at least for a few days), when they witness and come head on with a giant train crash, holding an alien that the military is trying to keep under wraps. The teens escape with this knowledge and are then pursued by said military... the film basically delves into a continuous desperate attempt to try and create characters who we really never end up truly caring about, and a plot that drones on, stretching for suspense but never achieving any of it. Later on after a semi-climactic (not really) final scene, the aliens escape and we really never get to know what happens to all the kids as the movie just ends.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film is that J.J. and Spielberg try to take various elements that would equate to a heart-warming movie - middle schoolers, puppy love, a simpler time and generation (1979), quiet mid-western town, etc - and try to toss in a strange antagonist (aliens) to mix things up, but never actually using any of these attributes to do anything worthwhile. What Spielberg and J.J. seem to forget is that these elements alone will not create an enjoyable film, you need a good script to do that, not to also mention better actors. In other words, while it was cute to get no-name teenage actors to feel more realistic instead of hiring Lindsay Lohan and the cast of High School Musical, they don't put on performances that really break any ground. They play their parts well enough, but never hold any chemistry or magic, many times when even given the opportunity simply act as wooden slabs, displaying forced puppy love crushes and social tension. It just never works, it's hardly ever believable. Sure they're cute and the "pretty girl" definitely can pull of the "mystery girl with a heart-melting smile" well, these things are all ruined by forced monologues of things that are never touched upon in any way during the film except for the part when the kids are just TELLING us. An example being one drawn out monologue with said pretty girl going on about some memory of her childhood while watching a film in a dark room with the kid who's going ga-ga over her... her forced tears don't fool anyone, I don't care what Spielberg says in the featurettes, it's boring and useless, does nothing to enhance her character or do we see any of these elements of what she's actually TALKING ABOUT during her monologue as all these kids (except for the main protagonist boy) don't even seem to have any parents! To put it another way, don't have a character talk about things in her life she does or does not like, have her cry over it, stretch to make it dramatic (even though it isn't because her character isn't built up well enough prior for us to care), and then NOT have these things she's talking about be seen in any way whatsoever throughout the movie.<br />Another minus being the military/airforce/whatever who is trying to keep the Area 51 alien under wraps. Of course they fail, but even though the aliens themselves are supposed to be the the villains, so are the military. The issue here is that the aliens do not make themselves well known enough for us to be scared of them, dislike them, or desire to see them die for being the villains - they just aren't written in the film well enough at all except for just a few scenes of "rarr! be scared! I'm the alien! The bad guy in the movie! rarrr!!" Sorry, but that just isn't enough. Moreover, the military/airforce guys are too nice. They don't do anything that makes us dislike them or see any reason whatsoever why we should even be rooting for these obnoxious kids. Hence, we don't. So there really don't feel to be any "bad guys" in the film.<br />To just make one last point, the time era the film takes place in also is near unbelievable. Sure it's 1979, and things aren't THAT much different than they are now, given a suburb, but the point just isn't made well enough, and I can't tell whether it's because of bad props or just not enough atmosphere helping me to really believe this really is 1979. A film like "Born on the Fourth of July" with Tom Cruise from the late 80s made the 60's FEEL like the 60's, as does the recent hit "The Help," as well as "Forest Gump." These films highlight their time era, thus making it more believable, and in a way making the characters more genuine and likable. What only adds to this problem is the way the kids in the movie speak. They don't SPEAK like kids who grew up in the 1970s, or act correctly in terms of body language; rather, they speak way too modern, all carry a sort of sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek attitude you'd expect from a kid growing up in the 2000's. Obviously Abrams is too young to even know how children acted in the 70s. Perhaps Spielberg could've written or directed a bit of this film, at least he has some experience during this time as it was when he created some of his most classic films.<br />Spielberg and Abrams like to boast about how this film is done to pay "homage" to old sci-fi thrillers of the past. Besides E.T., I honestly don't think anyone really cares. I mean, who has even seen these old 50's movies besides die-hard movie buffs themselves who are forking over about 1% of all this film's earnings? You want to pay homage? Fine. But at the very least make a GOOD movie with a GOOD script.<br />Anyway, aside from the lack of characterization, the plot goes nowhere as the military scenes involving the guys trying to cover the whole thing up are never interesting, and there are never any plot twists among any of the characters, but things just play out exactly as you'd expect them to throughout the movie. The ending just, well, ends. I actually remember fighting to not fall asleep during the the last half hour of the film.<br /><br />One reviewer states that this feels more like a big-budget Disney film, which is very true. This movie seems to want to impress adults by incorporating "childhood charm," but does none of it, especially not with that dumb alien storyline always getting in the way. This movie simply feels like a big-budget film that could've just been premiered on Disney XD. This one may have been intended for all ages, but adults simply won't feel any charm whatsoever, and neither will teenagers, although they may enjoy seeing peers their age argue, sometimes. Maybe, but I'm just chancing it.<br /><br />Spielberg has not made a decent film in years. Minority Report, though containing a great story and special effects, lacked good direction. There weren't very many thrilling scenes throughout it. Although it still worked mostly because it contained a good story. J.J. Abrams has got to be the most overrated director alive today, and only seems to do well simply because American audiences fall so easily for big-budget films with very little substance. While Star Trek made a good film, it did contain a good number of flaws, namely, a lame and boring enemy.... which is the same we get in Super 8. J.J. also can get a good word in by legendary directors, thus people simply fork up the money and say they enjoyed the film because they can't see past a special effects show with substandard characterization and a predictable script.<br /><br />While Super 8 wasn't terrible, it was definitely overrated, and just comes off as your average run-of-the-mill alien flick starring some kids who you won't ever remember again. The campaign for this film did lots to draw people in, considering all the mysterious teaser trailers that made this film almost feel like the most mysterious and epic alien-lands-on-earth film ever. It would be nice to actually, then, you know, make the aliens have some REAL interaction. I'd say rent, don't buy.<br /><br />Technical Stuff:<br />On a technical level, the Blu-ray disc looks great, the movie is sharp and sound is top-notch. The train crash scene (being the only worthwhile thing in the film, and the most exploited as it seems to be the only thing that drew people in) boasts of great bombastic sound and sharp picture, and beautiful explosions. The special features take are all filmed in HD, and take you into behind-the-scenes footage of making the film. Unfortunately, we can only take so much, as much of this is simply overkill. I don't need to see every waking moment of what people did and talked about while they were making the movie. Especially if it was a movie I didn't much even care for. The only films that can get away with this type of footage are ones where you REALLY want to know what went on... such as, let's say, Lord of the Rings.

review/summary: Charming Homage to Spielberg's Younger Days
review/text: Super 8 is a love story.  No, not a love story between the characters (sure, there's a little bit of that kissy stuff), but a love story between director J.J. Abrams and Stephen Spielberg.  It is obvious from Abrams's films that, like plenty of children who grew up in 70s and 80s, he was raised on the work of Spielberg and Lucas.  In fact, his Star Trek preboot arguably has more in common with the work of Lucas and Spielberg than with the original series.  Fashioning himself as something of a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Abrams has created a wonderful little homage to his mentor.<br /><br />The film opens with the off screen death of Joe Lamb's mother who worked at the local steel mill.  Both Joe and his father, Jackson, a deputy in the local police department, must deal with the emotional trauma that naturally comes from losing a loved one.  At the same time, the death also strains the relationship between Joe and Jackson.  Jackson just doesn't seem to know how to raise his son without his wife around, and he wants to ship him off to a baseball camp for the summer in the hopes that it will give him some space and stifle Joe's interest in filmmaking.  Joe has been serving as the special effects and make-up artist on his friends' movie about, what else, zombies.<br /><br />The kids' zombie movie is arguably the most important aspect of Super 8.  The gang's film represents the transformation of their playacting into an art form, a transition from childhood into adulthood that still manages to bridge these two conditions.  The film further embodies the split between the world of adults and children.  In many of Spielberg's early films, especially E.T., the difference between how children and adults see the world is represented in esoteric knowledge.  The fact that the wonderful and strange actually exists can only first be perceived by an innocent youth.  But it is also by making this film that the boys come into contact with the fairer sex.  The director, Charles, has managed to get a girl, Alice, to agree to play the part of the hero's wife.  Joe happens to have an unrequited crush on Alice, and later in the film he gets to play the daring hero to her damsel in distress when Alice is in danger.<br /><br />Oh, and there's also a giant space alien in the film that's trying to get off this planet while wreaking havoc on the towns folk.  The alien arrives in town by way of a derailed freight train.  The only witnesses to the train disaster are Joe and his gang who have set up next to the tracks in hopes of incorporating the train into their film so that it will lend it some verisimilitude.  The train derailment and the gang's escape is one of the finer set pieces of the film, and it is somewhat reminiscent of the plane crash in what is arguably Abrams's finest directorial effort, the pilot to the TV show Lost.  In all, the alien seems like something of an afterthought.  While Abrams does a commendable job of laying down some carefully constructed chaos, the alien himself seems somewhat perfunctory.  Unlike in E.T. (a movie that I cannot help comparing Super 8 to, even if a little unfairly), where E.T. served as a companion to a child of a single parent household who struggled to connect to other children of his own age, Super 8's monster seems like generic threat #5, seemingly picked out of a hat at random.  The alien menace and the drama of loss and adulthood never come together fully.  And while it is often enjoyable watching people escape or be eaten by the monster, I couldn't help but want to get back to the gang making their movie.<br /><br />But as homage the film does plenty right.  In the 80s Spielberg placed films he produced and directed in small town suburbia, often in the Pacific Northwest.  Likewise, Abrams's Super 8 takes place in a small town in Southwest Ohio.  We can tell the movie takes place in the late seventies because the local steel mill has yet to close down.  I also grew up in a small Ohio town, and while we didn't have a steel mill (maple syrup was a large part of the local economy), the setting did make me a little wistful for small town life.  One of the great messages that come out of Spielberg's early work as a director and producer, whether it is E.T. or Goonies, is that you need not leave your town to look for adventure.  The unusual, the exciting can be uncovered in your neighbors yard, the boarded up house down the street, or the local patch of woods.  The paradoxically infinite confines of suburbia were so full of excitement that leaving that world seemed unnecessary.<br /><br /> And in this sense, Abrams does a fine job of mimicking Spielberg.  He may not have all of the details right, but he has done his homework, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster.  In a world full of sequels and prequels, we need more movies like Super 8.  Abrams may fall into the clich&eacute; of the prodigy piano player carefully reconstructing a classic; he can play the notes but he misses the soul of the music.  But then again, the music was pretty great to begin with.

One of the most beautifully rendered of any I have ever seen.<br /><br />I would say that this film is the best of the summer blockbuster films of 2011 in a field that was largely filled with really bad comic book films.<br /><br />I happen to be exactly the same age as these characters - and the sets, props, music and ambience was perfectly set to the 1970s.  It was truly an amazing trip back to my childhood.<br /><br />The story was very interesting - but had the usual Spielberg ending - that did not seem to match the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Overall though, my family liked it very much.

review/text: I usually don't like movies about kids, but this one had the same kind of appeal that Goonies had.  It does draw you in.  It also has one of the best train wrecks I've ever seen in a movie.  If you listened to certain dialogue midway through the movie, you got tipped off as to what would ultimately happen.  It's been a very long time since I was a kid and I had to laugh about how serious they were about their movie project.  Still, they were quite believable and the mix of character personalities was good.  Ron Eldard, whose name, I had to look up, put in a very nice performance.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the pieces fit together a little too neatly, at the end.  Still, a fun movie.

review/summary: One of the best of 2011
review/text: First off, I have to point out that a lot of other reviews are saying this is a Spielberg film.  It's not.  It's a J.J. Abrams film.  He wrote, directed, and helped produce the movie.  Steven Spielberg is credited as a producer, and that is all.  So judge the film as you will, but don't label it as a Spielberg picture, because although it pays homage to the man, it's not HIS.<br /><br />All of this being said, I found Super 8 to be a fantastic film.  I enjoyed all of the references, both in style and shooting, to past Spielberg films.  There really hasn't been a film like this since some of Spielberg's greatest (E.T., Close Encounters, etc.).  If you have the ability to listen to dialogue, enjoy a story, and don't have the need for "in your face" CGI action every 3 seconds, then you might enjoy this.  It's a much more old-school style of filmmaking and storytelling.  The kids, especially Elle Fanning, are amazing.  The adult characters leave a bit to be desired.  All in all, though, it's an enjoyable movie from beginning to end.<br /><br />If Amazon would allow half-star ratings, I would have given this 4 1/2.  I feel it's one of the best movies of this year, though, so leaned towards the 5.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Very Good, But Not Great
review/text: I am looking forward to buying this Blu Ray immediately upon its release. If you are all about mindless action, blood, gore, etc... then avoid this film. If you are into human stories with action as the back-drop, then this is the movie for you. This is basically "Stand By Me" meets "Goonies" meets "Alien". The story was great, the acting, direction, and even the plot were superb. It is only towards the end that the movie shifts into the standard formula of action without intelligent thought. I know alien films require a certain suspension of belief, but this kinda goes to extremes.<br />All in all, it is a very good movie. Definately worth checking out!

review/summary: Great movie, but lacks in 2 areas.
review/text: Going to keep this short and sweet: Great summer blockbuster movie; awesome character development; set and scenery stunning. Only two problems I had with this movie: 1) Ending could have been better, just seemed way too clich&eacute;; 2) ***SPOILER ALERT*** But my major gripe: Was very disappointed to see JJ Abrams basically re-use the same monster from "Cloverfield", just on a smaller scale. I was expecting more originality than that, for Super 8.

review/text: I loved this movie (and that's what 5 stars means). It was just a great look at a bunch of kids stuck in extraordinary circumstances. It reminded me of something along the lines of E.T. or The Goonies (although not quite as epic). There were flaws, but overall, I enjoyed this movie immensely.

review/summary: Wonderful homage to the movies of the 70's / 80's
review/text: A Five Star movie.  Absolutely - however I will be the first to acknowledge that this has it's own unique niche audience, and won't be for everyone.  This is a love letter to the movies of the late 70's and 80's, the movie of Zemeckis, Dante and yes, most of all Spielberg.  For in this feature J.J. Abrams has created a love letter to Spielberg's era of moviemaking, a movie that both celebrates and emulates the styles and tools, the moviemaking grammar, and particularly the tone of movies from that era.<br />It's all that, but still wrapped in a story, one that has a set of familiar elements, but wrapped up in a new enough arrangement.  A bunch of kids in 1979 bond while making home movies with their Super 8 camera.  They are filming one night when they witness a terrible train crash.. but when the dust settles, there is something from the cargo of the train that has been released, and it is about to have a major impact on the town.  Scratch beneath that relatively simple skin though, and you'll find elements of the Goonies (bunch of kids coming of age through shared adventure), Close Encounters (paranoia, alien contact affecting ordinary small town folk), Gremlins (the black humour), and E.T. (adolescents coming of age in damaged families). And if this is an homage to Spielberg, then it's earlier Spielberg - the guns, deaths and occasional mild swear words aren't airbrushed out. It is very much a story first and foremost about real kids, living real lifes, and much less about the fantastic events happening around them.  Yes there is spectacle towards the end, but only as a pay off to the emotional journey of the characters.. if it's just the action or effects you want, you will likely be disappointed.  In fact, if there is any off note in the movie, it is the appearance of cgi - a very modern tool to tell an old fashioned story, and taking you out of the nostalgia trip somewhat. But it's not enough to derail the journey.<br />It's not just the director; the look, the feel of the movie, down through sets, period detail and even the musical score, also celebrate that early 80's feel.  And let's not forget those lead roles - kids who actually come across as real, likeable, believable - the scenes where they have to emote, particularly Elle Fanning, are amazingly genuine, and the relationship between the leads is handled in a delicate way which uses visuals and acting more than it does clunky exposition or awkward dialogue.<br />So yes, it is my own personal 5 stars.. Maybe it's too nostalgic to appeal to today's kids, maybe its too much about kids to appeal to today's adults.  But for me, I am just at that age that when I was young and impressionable it was Spielberg and Dante and the rest that stirred my own passion for movies, that made that first mark, that created those moments that would be my first love of cinema.. and it is precisely that feeling that has been captured and celebrated here.  This is what happens when movies about kids are made by mature filmmakers.  Watching it, I felt like that young wide eyed kid in the cinema again, and it was a glorious feeling.

review/text: Engaging when focusing on the kids and their growth and understanding with the complexities of the adult world. Less so when it was an action movie (most of the last half).<br /><br />Not just nostalgic for a way of life, but for a kind of filmmaking, one that put story over spectacle. Which is ironic, since it's the spectacle that prevents Super 8 from being a classic.

review/summary: Derivative? Yes.  Boring? Not At All
review/text: I haven't been particularly wound up in the films of Spielberg.  "Jaws" was fantastic.  He often repeats himself a bit too closely and when another director follows his lead, the results could be disastrous.  This film wasn't as bad as some people have been led to think.  They're married to the style and overly involved in a type of movie that by now leads to repetition and cliche.  For those of us not buried in this genre, the film has its good points.<br />The kids played their parts quite well, for the main part.  The girl was outstanding.<br />The last shots near the end of the film made the kids look ten years older and that didn't work out at all.  The music was strictly by the numbers but it's exhilirating<br />to hear a full orchestra.  There were no real themes or development.  I personally stopped caring about the monster somewhere midway in the film.<br />The situation and the drama are aimed directly at the audience, as if, somehow, somebody had rated each scene according to saleability and then strung them together.<br />The tricks have been done before in other films but then again so have the Sherlock Holmes films or the Thin Man series, or Star Trek...The list is enormous.  There's nothing inherently bad in repeating success.  Hollywood has been doing it for over a hundred years.  When the repetition is ham-fisted, though, it does become quite annoying and this was ham-fisted all right.  However the film does fly by, there are no "dead" moments until the saccharine ending which aims at the heartstrings but reaches the bile of the viewer instead.  Anyone could have organized a more efficient ending. I did enjoy most of the film, though, and the production values helped it out in a big way.<br /><br />Curtis Stotlar

review/text: ... SO glad I didn't!  The acting is superb, especially the kids... of course it had a taste of ET and The Goonies in there, which I loved as well.... The story line itself might as well be classified "martian" but it's a little aggravating you can never really see it - is that a spider or a ... uh... in any case, it kinda added to the appeal, LOL.<br /><br />Also, typically not a fan of watching things blow up but this had really believable effects, in my opinion, sparing me the stupid godawful computer animation so common today... It really was a tense film, a sweet little puppy love story, sadness of loss story and then, well, a bit of a monster movie.  And your kids can watch it since it's not gory... I'd say 11+.

review/summary: an oldie, but a goody
review/text: SUPER 8 was many things: a father/son estrangement drama, a puppy-love romance, an ode to the cultish B-movies of the 70s, an ensemble coming-of-age piece, the lot of which flavored with sci-fi seasoning. Above all, I think, this is an homage to the disappearing Creature-Feature genre. J. J. Abrams' alien is beautifully and meticulously rendered in seamless CG. We are permitted the occasional glimpse -- a hand, a leg -- more and more of the unique form offering up pieces of itself as the story progresses. The small tastes continue to tease us until finally, during the last 20 minutes, we are rewarded with an animal quite unlike anything we've seen, or even dared to imagine, before. This is not M. Night's SIGNS, in which the final reveal of the antagonizing extra-terrestrials appears to be little more than a man in green spandex. In SUPER 8, everything from the arrangement of the beastie's limbs to its peculiar form of locomotion are, quite frankly, alien. Kudos to whoever designed it.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the pace of SUPER 8, but the "dragging" plot seems to me like a conscious decision on the part of the director. I believe Abrams intentionally employed that 70s style of movie-making, harkening back to a time before the advent of the MTV quick-cut, (a visual style created either for or by [a chicken/egg dilemma] ADHA sufferers with severely limited attention-spans). This movie is not for Generation Ritalin; I suspect that viewers over the age of 30 will have no problem sitting through the 1 hour 51 minutes.<br /><br />All of the kid actors are impressive, but Elle Fanning is particularly superb. She has a a characteristic, silent-movie manner, so that more than tears pour from her eyes: the entirety of what Fanning is feeling emanates from them as well. Some other reviewers have criticized the harsh language of our young protagonists, but they are meant to be middle school students and are therefore at that age during which they're desperately trying to broadcast their budding maturity; peppering their speech with expletives is one traditional method -- I remember doing this myself at age 12, cursing like a sailor because I was sure that was how "real" adults spoke.<br /><br />I'd say my only true criticism would concern my disbelief in the ability of a pick-up truck to completely derail a massive, speeding train while sustaining only passenger-side damage and leaving the driver alive. Other than that, SUPER 8 was super great. This movie is what would have happened if E.T. had been captured by government agents and subjected to a decade of torturous experimentation, so that by the time he broke out, the once lovable little extra-terrestrial would have become decidedly less cuddly -- munching on humans like celery sticks as he works away (I won't tell you what he's building, you'll have to watch and discover that for yourself). And even though this premise has been done many times before, it was nonetheless masterfully executed, resulting in a beautiful depiction of a familiar, yet fantastic tale.<br /><br />SUPER 8: an oldie, but a goody.

review/summary: THEY DONT MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS IN HOLLYWOOD ANY MORE, UNTILL NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: This is by far the best film of 2011. It reminded me of movies like close encounters of the third kind, stand by me, and  the goonies. It had a 70's or 80's feel to it; you know back in the golden era of modern cinema that was shaped by the likes of GEORGE LUCAS, FRANCES FORD COPALA and the GOD of a man, the best film maker of all time who produced the film I am critiquing right now, STEVEN SPIELBERG. What more can I say except buy this DVD you wont be disappointed. The sound track by, Michael Giacchino is also great very much in the vain of JOHN WILLIAMS. Giacchino also scored such works as, JJ ABRAMS "STAR TREK" and the upcoming "star trek sequel", "the incredible's", the show "lost", "ratatouille", "john carter" and the video games "MEDAL OF HONOR" AND "MEDAL OF HONOR 2", One last thing the kids in this could really act I am surprised none of them were up for Oscars especially Elle Fanning, who if you didn't know is Dakota Fanning's little sister.

review/text: The kids in this movie can act WAAAYY better than most of hollywood actors/actresses combined. The scene with Elle Fanning made my jaw drop when I watched it in the cinema.  The train wreck scene alone is worth buying this bluray for. To me, this is not a kids movie. As for special features, they made it so fancy that it became annoying. They should have included a "play all" function so I dont have to keep selecting clip after clip (each clip is only a few minutes anyway). In the end I just gave up and continued with another bluray (Platoon; which I also wrote about; awesome movie+bluray). Buy this bluray (Super 8). Platoon too.

review/summary: Child Actors Make The Film
review/text: I thought this was a really good movie. The child actors far surpassed the adults' performances. I normally don't like watching alien movies, but this one had good characters and the alien was the backstory actually. It was more about Joe's loss of his mother and Alice's dad being involved in that somewhat. Also, Joe and Alice like each other.<br />The special effects of the train crash were very good. I wanted to back away as in several scenes I felt as if the train was coming through the screen at me. The train derailment seemed to never end and I waited for someone to be killed in a horrible way as there were train cars and parts flying everywhere.<br />One of the parts I liked best was when the credits were rolling, on the left side the movie the kids had made was playing. Too cute.<br />I recommend this movie to people who like supernatural, alien and horror movies.

review/text: Super 8 has a terrific premise with themes you'll recognize and may be tempted to label as borrowed - but done in a 100% original way.<br /><br />Coming of age characters reminiscent of The Sandlot, Stand by Me, and The Wonder Years - I grew up with kids just like these. Nostalgic and real without being juvenile.<br /><br />A story about the military and an alien that is every bit as enjoyable as Close Encounters and ET.<br /><br />Wild-ride action a-la Indiana Jones and The Goonies.<br /><br />No cursing and a less-is-more approach to the gore - think Jaws, Star Wars, and Independence Day.<br /><br />The great 70's sets, haircuts, and costumes - Loved the convenience store and similar details.<br /><br />That fantastic Abrams humor - shows up in everything he does. The boy-banter is so dead accurate, I laughed out loud more than once. I'll watch it again just to catch everything they say - I did the same with Star Trek.<br /><br />The techno-heavy scenes are well done - they add to the movie without detracting from the feeling of watching a 70's story.<br /><br />Bottom line - This movie is for those who want to be entertained for entertainment's sake. The overall effect far outweighs any flaws. Alone, with a friend, a date, or your kids - it's just plain good.

review/summary: Super 8 Rates a 10
review/text: I didn't even know that Super 8 was a 'monster movie' or 'alien movie'. I just knew it was a new J.J. Abrams project. Since I am a fan, mostly because I am a fan, I made it to my viewing with little outside bias.<br /><br />I'd rate the film at four stars, but the effects and extra footage included with this BD are quite enough to gently push this to push this film forward into the five-star shelf in my film library. Much like Star Trek, the cinematography and scoring are amazing. Much like Cloverfield, an amazing design of monster hits the screen like no other. But if you are in the viewing for this as a monster/kid-friendly movie, you've got an awesome bid you're looking towards. I say 'kid' with some variance of course, meaning those of age comparable to the actors, but I know some parents would disagree. The kids swear a fair amount, but it's nothing too terrible. And the clincher - the on-screen violence is very minimal. And that's rare enough in movies nowadays. But many parents will doubtless think of films such as E.T., the Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, et al. And should be more than enough to get the whole family to sit down as pass the popcorn.

review/summary: This film really feels like summer
review/text: While Super 8 is reminiscent of Spielberg's past films, and pays homage to the big 70s or 80s sci-fi hits, it still is a film that stands on its own.  The film's main characters are developed for the most part, and the coming of age theme fits in nicely with the story. The action and sci-fi elements are there, yes, but they don't take precedent over the characters and the spirit of the film.  As others have stated, Super 8 does have a Stand by Me/ Goonies kind of vibe to it, with a bit of teenage crush thrown in.<br /><br />A group of kids in a rural Ohio town witness a horrific train wreck while they are out filming a scene for a film contest.  One of the boys, Joe, however, notices that a car had also been in on the disaster. The driver of the vehicle, who is badly hurt, has puzzling and ominous warning to the startled children. This message has more meaning as odd supernatural events begin to take place in the area. The military comes in, but there is the sense that all is not right in the small town. Joe's father, Police Chief, begins to look for answers to the odd happenings.<br /><br />One of the things I liked leading up to this film's opening last year was that the trailers held back on revealing major spoilers, which was kind of refreshing in a day and age when we are given too much during previews. The producers take this a step further by showing the "creature" minimally, the "less is more" approach adding more suspense the plot.<br /><br />If there is one weakness of Super 8, it is that the ending was a little weak. It got a bit over the top, and sort of felt a bit jumbled, like the film lost steam as it headed to the finish.<br /><br />Still, Super 8 has that summer blockbuster feel to it that makes it a treat to watch. There are also some standout performances by Elle Fanning (Alice) and Joel Courtney (Joe).<br /><br />Super 8 is definitely one to check out.

review/summary: Interesting, but does not compare to the beloved  "E.T."
review/text: "Super 8" on Blu-ray was excellent, with a picture and sound 5 star. The story has an interesting screenplay, but suffers terribly in the end. With so much inherent power of the "creature" it is difficult to accept the mediocre end of this  movie, since the E.T. decided at the last minute  make a spaceship just using  scrap  with the power of your mind. The logical deduction is that the E.T. could have done it all before all the confusion he pitched throughout the movie, but then the movie would need a new and more intelligent screenplay, or a new story. The film holds our attention and is quite fun, except for the final very silly that is not worthy of producer Steven Spielberg and of director  J.J. Abrams. So I give only 4 stars to the overall.

review/summary: I wanted this to be super...
review/text: I remember when `Super 8' was about to drop.  Everyone that I knew was in a state of frenzy.  It just looked so wonderful.  The nostalgia of seeing a science fiction film in the same vein as those pioneered by Steven Spielberg was almost too good to be true.  Could `Super 8' really be this generation's `E.T.'?  The world was on edge and nearly every Oscar prognosticator was prematurely claiming it a lock in nearly every tech category, and some were even claiming that it was on its way to Best Picture and possibly even Best Director glory.<br /><br />Then it opened to lukewarm critical response, fizzled out and walked away with ZERO Oscar nominations.<br /><br />I was one of those who rushed to predict this everywhere, and I was wholly thrilled to see the film.  It just looked so lovely.  The biggest issue with a film like `Super 8' is that it is rather silly.  The bugs were not worked out wholly.  The script, while rich with contagious dialog (the sparring between the child actors is the finest part of the film) is too unsure of itself to aid the film any.  When we are focused on the alien, the film falls apart; and that is a sad fact considering that the whole draw here was, in all respects, the alien.<br /><br />So here's the basic premise.  In Ohio, way back in 1979, there was a young boy named Joe.  Joe's mother has died and he's obviously distraught about it.  His father love him, but he's preoccupied with work (he's the Sheriff's Deputy) and he's a little too hard edged.  Joe's best friend Charles is obsessed with making movies and convinces the neighborhood kids to make a zombie film with him.  While making the film, a train crashes and a `thing' escapes and havoc is set loose on the small town as dogs and eventually people start disappearing.  The military is all over it, the citizens are in a panic and Joe and his friends start searching for the answers.<br /><br />Visually, the film works to a certain extent.  The special effects can feel a little overdone in parts (the crash itself lasts far too long and screams "look at me") and the alien itself is an uninspired disappointment.  That said, the set pieces are beautifully done and the whole feel of the era portrayed is nicely kept in tone.  The atmosphere of the film's first half is flawless.  In fact, leading up to the actual alien business, I was thinking this film was truly brilliant.  Sadly, it takes a nosedive into clich&eacute; ridden sci-fi with little inspiration to keep it afloat.  The child performances are all great; Elle Fanning proving once again that she deserves an Oscar, but the adults are all simple creations that lack depth.  The token villain (the military Col. Nelec) is a walking stereotype, and Noah Emmerich is a terrible actor.  I hated the ending, for it felt lazy and rushed and so not worthy of the tremendous build up.  In fact, I really wish that the whole alien thing had been scrapped from this movie completely.  It just didn't work.<br /><br />Why couldn't J.J. Abrams have attempted to make this generation's `Stand By Me' instead?<br /><br />Alas, I'm giving this a B-.  It was surely entertaining, despite its failure to live up to my high expectations.  The acting was very nice and the tone of the film was beautifully rendered.  This is a very good movie; but it could have been great.

review/summary: Well made and entertaining
review/text: Super 8 is a homage to extra terrestrial films and is one of the better film to come during the summer in 2010. The characters are believable, you start to like the children and identify their passion for adventure and film making. They are the soul and the best thing. The adults are more or less props, except for Kyle Chandler and Ron Eidard who have substantial roles. There are some flaws, I did not feel a emotional connect with the alien. There are also a few minor characters whom I felt deserved some screen time such as the science teacher and the military guy. However this is a exceptional film in many respects. Abrams and his crew capture the ambiance of a small town and the essence of childhood curiosity. Four stars. 2/18/2012

review/summary: Not your traditional E.T.
review/text: I just rented this last night and it has everything a movie needs to be successful. It's exciting, touching,and thought provoking. It basically asks,"What would happen if the sweet little E.T. of 1982 had been bigger, captured, held prisoner for 20+ years abused and then gets lose?"<br />As an audience we are first scared with the the abundance of confusion and at the end we are angry at the inhumane humans and then deeply touched by the simple love of family that finally is realized.<br />This movie is great for all age levels but if there are family members younger than 8, Mom or Dad should be there as support because it's got some graphic scenes.

review/summary: Alien meets E.T.
review/text: Super 8 was billed as a tribute to movies like E.T. and the days of the child filmmaker in the late 1970s. The first few minutes seem to hold true to this. The movie starts with a bunch of kids making amateur movies. The acting is superb and it really evokes the images I have of a young Spielberg and Lucas making movies.<br /><br />However, it doesn't continue. About a quarter into the movie, it suddenly transforms into a 2000s movie. The kids start filming a scene and then accidentally catch a major train crash on film. Next, the movie turns into a sci-fi/alien mystery/thriller. While it's a mystery for all of the adults in the movie, to 21st century viewers the odd series of events obviously point to an alien. Thus, there really isn't any mystery to unravel. Also, the plot gyrates back and forth between Alien and E.T., which just doesn't make for a good mix. Some moments are really dark and scary, while at other points we're supposed to be laughing with the kids or staring in wonder.<br /><br />Fortunately, the kids are a joy to watch in their respective roles. Each of their characters possesses realistic quirks and lights of inspiration, from the chubby director to the pyromaniac "zombie" actor. They more than anything else capture that wild and free spirit of the young boy with his super 8 camera. Elle Fanning is superb as the girl who gets recruited to act in the amateur movies. Her acting scene near the beginning showed a level of maturity and intensity that left me agog. I think the movie would have been a LOT better if J.J. Abrams had stuck to the 1980s formula of really focusing the movie on the kids, as in E.T. or Goonies.<br /><br />Also, some of the overdone CG special effects, such as the train crash, seemed out of place and unrealistic. Did we really need a scene where the kids run from an exploding train? That's the type of Hollywood nonsense that wouldn't have passed muster 30 years ago.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, but I think it departed a bit too much from the homage it was intended to be.  J.J. Abrams made a strong sci-fi movie with superb child actors, but can't quite escape the baggage of the past decade in cinema.

review/summary: I completely identified with these young characters...
review/text: Super 8 - This movie is a cross between Stand By Me, and E.T. with some Cloverfield thrown in for some intense action. It has all the makings (and perhaps the pitfalls) of a `summer blockbuster' hit; tense moments, high action, laughs, drama, and over-the-top special FX.  At the center of the story is a group of young kids trying to make an amateur film for a film contest. I completely identified with this group of youngsters struggling for accomplishment and battling the forces that be to get it done. The young cast was considerably talented playing each of their characters to believable perfection. Quite a few reviews here had questions and negative comments about the alien and its motives. I think perhaps  they were expecting a Riddley Scott `Alien' type of movie. Like all `fantastic story' films, if you look too close you will find imperfections, that`s just the nature of the beast. In the end this movie was really about a group of kids forced to grow up very quickly when faced with a serious situation. I enjoyed this film very much.<br />* Make sure you sit through the end credits to see the completed `Super-8 film' submission.

review/text: I had never heard of Elle Fanning before seeing Super 8. Her performance in the movie impressed me so much I wanted to write about it. In my opinion, this movie proves she is a great actress and will hopefully have a long career in movies. Her acting is so believable and at the right times emotionally powerful. I sat down to be entertained by a light Spielberg-esque film and ended up flabbergasted at how much her performance affected me. She is a real artist and I can't wait to see her next film. How can someone so young be so skilled at portraying and evoking emotions in others. All I can say is WOW! And, by the way, I don't think I'm in her demographic as a middle aged person.

review/summary: Unexpected pleasures
review/text: Super 8 offered true enjoyment in forms I did not expect. Action, excitement, and otherworldly adventure are stock-in-trade for Spielberg and Abrams, and that expectation is what first drew me to the film. But those elements of the movie quickly became less and less interesting, even a bit burdensome, while other aspects emerged as genuinely engaging, delightful, and moving. Super 8 is a genuinely good and worthwhile film not for the elements one expects from Spielberg and Abrams but from those one does not. I'll be specific. The underlying premise of the film (which I will not reveal) which drives the basic plot and offers a whopping dose of the extraterrestrial unknown, but proves utterly predictable and if visually exciting, conceptually leaden, heavy handed, and, really, just inevitable. The same is true for the movie's themes, which come close to being gaggingly sentimental and simplistic as is often the case with a Spielberg project focusing on young people. But the plot, action, even the special effects really serve as a vehicle for the development of characters: their emotions/perceptions and relationships. In other words, it wasn't what literally happened in the film that grabbed me -- it was the way different characters (as individuals and in relation to each other) experienced those events that made the movie great. Abrams handles his young actors far, far better than Spielberg ever has done and allows them to rise above "the idea of youth" that is so deadly and false in Spielberg to become convincing, likeable, fascinating, and endearing people with believable identities. Brilliantly, Abrams has all the main characters experience the main events in individual ways; the main characters grow and change in real time, before our eyes, through the experiences they are having. And as the characters change, real relationships -- which are numerous -- grow and change, too. The performances are wonderfully varied, and all the main performers are terrific. Elle Fanning may be the standout here, leaving far behind the "look at me; I'm a young actor" effect that tends to mar her sister's work. All of the young actors skilfully create distinct characters but the viewer never ends up thinking "this kid can act" because we believe in their creations. And it is how these young characters experience the events in the movie, not those events, that really grabbed me. There is fear and uncertainty, pain and loss, but it is ultimately the sweetness of finding others that makes this less a thrilling film than a genuinely beautiful one.

review/text: This film worked for me on several levels, but for those of us who were budding filmmakers in the late 70s and early 80s, this was a love letter and a testament all rolled into one. At one point or another I uttered virtually every line those kids said while trying to talk my friends into my filmmaking exploits (though they were far more successful than I ever was at talking family and friends into the act). This film was beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and aside from JJ Abrams's penchant to insert superflous lens flares into everything he makes, it was an outstanding snapshot of the era. A shame there aren't more movies being made like this these days.

review/summary: ALIEN GO HOME
review/text: SUPER 8 is writer/director J.J. Abrams' paen to Spielberg and even a gentle nod to King's STAND BY ME.  In essence, the coming-of-age theme overshadows the sci-fi elements and provide the film's heart.<br />Set in 1979, the story follows the misadventures of a group of teens bonded by friendship and their attempt to make their own zombie movie for a contest.  Things heat up when a train crash results in the release of an extraterrestrial creature.<br />The young actors are superb, especially Elle Fanning and Josh Courtney.  Fanning has an uncanny maturity and lovely innocence that prophesizes a great future in films.  Just savor her marvelous "transformation" to a zombie--it's priceless.  And marvel at Courtney when he stands up in hurt defiance at his stern father.  You feel his anguish.  Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) and Ron Eldard (Blind Justice) are outstanding in non-cliche roles as the fathers.<br />The special fx are good but I would have liked to see more of the creature to add terror impact.  Abrams' script and direction capture the period nicely.  However, the movie confuses us as to whether the alien is to be feared or sympathized with.  After all, Alice states "It's just hungry and wants to go home."---the same creature who has been wiping out the town's citizens and dogs.  And is the strange device that moves around in Joe's room alive?<br />SUPER 8 is certainly enjoyable but may frighten younger children.  Adults may enjoy its nostalgia and gentle depiction of friendship and love.

Super 8 is one of the best examples of this, filled with fantastic suspense, lighthearted humor and just enough magic to pull off the unlikely chain of events that unfold in the small Ohio town of Lillian.<br /><br />Despite some obvious plot imperfections (including an underwhelming climax and semi-predictable ending) the movie proves very satisfying to almost anyone who can relate to what it's like growing up in small-town/suburban america. Absolutely loved the whole feel of the movie and and wish I could relive my childhood days making homemade movies with my friends. Super 8 is childhood at it's best!

review/summary: The most overrated movie of the decade!
review/text: For the second time in one year I find myself scratching my head and wondering if I saw the same film others did; those that positively RAVED the film anyway. INSIDIOUS was the first over-hyped movie that left me speechless as to just how OVERRATED (and lame) a movie could be, and that was soon followed by SUPER 8. The original teaser trailer promised something dark and sci-fi spooky in the vein of X-FILES. However the trailer didn't blow me away, nor did it make me want to see the film. When I started hearing that this film actually was a lighter film and would recall the better days of Spielberg in which childhood and adventure blended perfectly, I began to get hopeful. But within thirty-minutes of SUPER 8, I felt nothing but disappointment, and that feeling only intensified as the movie lumbered along. An immediate turn-off was the language. I don't care if kids REALLY DO talk like sailors or not, the amount of profanity, which includes one or two instances of the 'F' bomb in this film, is ridiculous and unnecessary. Add to that, the sexual humor and at least one instance of drug-abuse from one character, and you DO NOT have a family film in the best tradition of Spielberg. You have a movie that offends and will probably anger some parents who fell to the hype. Look at the PG-13 rating folks! It's there for a reason!<br /><br />I have read where others have compared this to films like GOONIES and STAND BY ME. Those films had likeable, believable kids. SUPER 8's kids are irritatingly loud, irresponsible and vulgar. So why am I supposed to LIKE them? The fact is, I don't. They are examples of the WORST kind of behavior from children. I have heard this film defended for its language, because that's how kids really talk. I get it, but that doesn't mean that a film MUST adhere to that kind of realism in order to keep their audience entertained. Other films have won children and adults over alike without resorting to profanity; certainly not to the degree that SUPER 8 contains.<br /><br />Having kids curse in films is a bore. It's not needed.<br /><br />As for the big sci-fi ALIEN elements within SUPER 8, all I can say is WOW, couldn't they have come up with something more original than that? All in all, a summer BUST for me. If you liked or loved it, fine. I didn't. If I really want my family to watch a film that blends childhood with sci-fi adventure and doesn't rely on anything offensive, I'll just put in IRON GIANT or HOOK, or a thousand other films that are better than SUPER 8.

review/summary: JJ Abrams is no Steven Spielberg
review/text: Well, this movie was OK, there were lots of flaws to this one.<br /><br />First off, there is this new trend in movie-making to have this atrocious bigger-than-life sound to it and as a result the volume is either too loud or too low, this movie fails because of this flaw, the sound is just awful, noisy, busy, and tiresome.<br /><br />Next, the lighting was also just plain awful, very dark to the point of distraction, you will wind up just wanting it to be over already.<br /><br />Another annoying thing that Mr. Abrams tried, and failed at, was trying to create realistic dialog with the character talking over each other and lots busy stuff going on in every single tiresome scene and it just fails. I think that this is because the film had so little ground to cover in what seemed like a very long time...yawn...<br /><br />What was good about this movie were the kids, I mean, the movie that they made in the film, it was pretty good...<br /><br />My suggestion? Don't expect a Spielberg experience from this movie...

review/summary: Entertaining, engrossing and extra-terrestrial - Derivative but from the very best
review/text: Super 8 is admittedly not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it so much, and was so taken by the characters and the actors playing them, that I didn't really mind the occasional inconsistency or lingering "awed expressions" scene.<br /><br />Set in a small town in Ohio in 1979, the basic plot centers around Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a 13-year-old boy whose mother recently died in a factory accident, leaving him with only his father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a sheriff's deputy who's a more than decent man but who has never known how to really be a father. Jackson's escape is burying himself in his work, while Joe's is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make an amateur zombie movie with the help of their other friends Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Cary (Ryan Lee). But Joe's involvement becomes truly committed when Charles persuades Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), a girl he secretly has a crush on, to join the project.<br /><br />Things taken a sudden turn when, in the midst of shooting a midnight scene at the local railroad depot, Joe sees a pickup truck suddenly drive onto the tracks, directly in the path of an oncoming freight train, resulting in a spectacular crash that sends freight cars derailing everywhere and the shocked kids running for cover. The plot quickly thickens when Joe gets a glimpse of something bursting out of one of the freight cars, and when they find the driver of the pickup, badly injured, is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher, who warns them to get away and to never speak of what they've seen to anyone or they - and their parents - will be killed. And then there's the knocked over Super 8 camera that has been continuing to roll throughout everything, capturing something that no one else saw while they were busy tried not to get crushed by flying debris. Something that will become important later as strange things begin to happen:  dogs fleeing the town for no apparent reason, car engines and other pieces of machinery being stolen, people suddenly disappearing. And of course the massive influx of military personnel who are crawling all over everything while their commander, Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) blandly insists that there's _nothing_ going on.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn, fleshed out with real personalities, quirks and flaws, and you very quickly come to care about them.  And the actors, most of them either fairly unknown or newcomers, are marvelous, the kids in particular as they're at the heart of the film, but also the adults, particularly Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the two fathers linked - and separated - by tragedy, each not doing so well at dealing with it. Joel Courtney as Joe has one of those faces that projects everything he's feeling, from the distance he's experiencing with his dad to the secret yet painfully obvious crush he has on Alice. Riley Griffiths as his best friend Charles is a perfect counterpoint, pursuing his film with single-minded determination but holding other things in. Ryan Lee's pint-sized braces-laden (and explosives-crazy) Cary is a riot, as is Gabriel Basso's Martin as the zombie film's leading man who has an unfortunate tendency to puke a lot, while Zach Mills' Preston has the healthiest fear-instinct of the crowd. And last but not least, Elle Fanning's Alice is a wonder, a sensitive girl with her own father issues whose unexpected natural talent at acting leaves the boys with their jaws hanging.<br /><br />Super 8 is highly derivative, but in a good way. It draws on the best parts of any number of movies from the past, most notably E.T. (1982) and The Goonies (1985) but also films like Joe Dante's Explorers (1985) , The Bad News Bears (1976) and, more recently, Son of Rambow (2007), a little seen but marvelous independent British film about a couple of boys with family issues who bond over making an amateur movie.<br /><br />Note:  in one scene, there's a definite tip-of-the-hat prop taken right out of Spielberg's E.T.  Just keep your eyes peeled when the camera closes in on the water tower near the climax of the movie and see if anything looks strikingly familiar.<br /><br />There are admittedly weak points in the film, mainly where it seems uncertain of just which direction it wants to take or where inconsistencies tend to be glaring. Is the alien dangerous and deadly... or just misunderstood? Is the alien killing people... or just holding on to them for a while?  The trouble is that in different parts of the film it's definitely one, but in other parts of the film it's the other.  And the climactic lingering "awed expressions" scene does feel at odds with the the life-threatening dangers the characters were experiencing earlier (not to mention the burning shambles half the town has been reduced to). Another weak point is the villain, Col. Nelec (I suspect the name Nelec is an in-joke of some kind), who is never anything but a cliched military bad guy.  But as I said, while these things do keep it from being a perfect film, they don't in the end get in the way from it being an engaging and enjoyable one.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes an engaging film that sucks you in and keeps you involved all the way through, and that values story and character over special effects and stars.

review/summary: 1 of the Best films I've seen in 2011 - 5 Stars for both movie and blu-ray transfer
review/text: First off, I just finished watching an advance blu-ray copy of this film and the movie and blu-ray transfer blew me away.  IMO, this film is one of the very best of 2011 and if you are a fan of "old-fashioned" type drama/suspense films that have to do with extra-terrestrial life and what happens to a small rural community in the late 1970's is truly a film that will stay with you long after the movie's end.  To give any more away would be a sin, so I won't.<br /><br />The blu-ray video and audio is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is what appears to be 2.35:1 or thereabouts (Amazon has it wrong at 1.85:1).  The video throughout is pristine with vivid colors in the daylight scenes and ink blacks in the night scenes.  Details are vivid as you would expect from a top-notch blu-ray transfer.  The audio equals the quality of the video and I've had to monitor the volume because I live in an apartment and use a 9.1 speaker configuration.  Vocals came mainly from the center speaker along with the two front speakers that sometimes spilled over to the speakers located in the right and left middle ends of the room.  Music and sounds were extremely active in all the remaining speakers.  This film's sound truly rocked my movie room.<br /><br />I have over a thousand blu-rays and this film is in the top two of all films made and released in 2011.  YES, it is that good!!!<br /><br />I just pre-ordered this from Amazon.com at the price of $24.99 and that's more than I usually pay for a new movie on blu-ray.  I usually wait until the price comes down (which almost always happens) a few months down the road.  But this is one film I have to have on release day.

review/text: I saw Super 8 at IMAX today.  LOVED it and want to see it again, soon!  I laughed, I cried, and I jumped up out of my seat 8 times!  It was a fun, fun nostalgic ride on an early summer afternoon.  The late 1970's music, costumes, location, and set props were right on.  Fantastic cinematography, sound design, and special affects.<br /><br />Ahhhh, but this movie has heart in the story and in the acting.  Kyle Chandler, Elle Fanning, and the new young actor who plays Joe Lamb steal the movie.  This 'coming of age' story is set in a more innocent time, before middle schoolers began 'hooking up.'  The rest of the kids who make up the motley film crew are believably hilarious.  Each cleverly has his or her own specialty in film making.  You can only imagine a young JJ Abrams doing the same thing when he was a boy.<br /><br />Super 8 is not the BEST movie I've ever seen, and the ending is somewhat predictable.  But it is the BEST movie I've seen in a long, long time.

review/summary: Great Fun!
review/text: Super 8 is a remarkably entertaining movie, especially for those of us who lived through the '70's, before working class became coterminous with working poor.  If you missed that decade, the ambience provided by the old steel mill town of Weirton, West Virginia may seem implausible and a bit hokey.<br /><br />The plot line is pretty simple, and I admit that it does invite comparison with another of Spielberg's films, namely the blockbuster hit E.T.  The parallels are not so close, however, as to legitimate the suspicion that<br />Spielberg is just stealing from his past successes and recycling old ideas.  After all, the kids in Super 8 are older, the action scenes are astonishing, viewers are treated to a really cleverly done instance of a film within a film, and we've even got romance.<br /><br />I have no idea where the kid actors came from, but they are very good.  Each in his or her own way is engaging and, for the most part, quite believable.  The kids are at their best when appearing in their own zombie-themed movie, so be sure to watch it along with the closing credits.  It's really interesting to see them portray kid actors making a kid movie -- stilted, stiff, and stammering -- after they've shown us that none of these afflictions of youth and inexperience hamper their performances in Super 8 proper.<br /><br />Glyn Turman does a fine job as Dr. Woodward.  (He's probably best known as the mayor of Baltimore in the HBO series The Wire, and fans of In Treatment will also recognize him.)  The rest of the adult cast is adequate, but it's the kids who steal the show.<br /><br />I first saw Super 8 in a theater and a year or so later on DVD.  I loved it both times.  It is, indeed, a lot of fun.

The characters were generally likable, the action sequences were well done (though admittedly, the train crash scene probably brought a tear to Michael Bay's eye), the story was simple yet effective, the production values were off the charts. Will this movie be heralded in the future as a classic like, perhaps, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or E.T.? No. But it's still a great movie, and a lot of fun to watch. J.J. Abrams is quickly becoming one of my favorite modern Science Fiction directors.

review/summary: 'Super 8' is an excellent homage to Spielberg!
review/text: Every now and then, a film comes along and reminds you of the way it used to be. Back in the eighties, blockbusters were made with heart. Everything from the acting to the direction was top-notch, especially if the film in question was a Spielberg film. Steven Spielberg is one of the best film directors in the industry. His love of the medium shines in just about every project that he has been a part of. Some of the most influential films of the past have his name attached to them, namely E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jurassic Park. He deals with fantastical themes with a heartfelt, childlike curiosity - a definite trademark that appears in many of his films. Recently, director J.J. Abrams made a film which can be seen as a love letter to Spielberg. This film is `Super 8', and it is one of the best offerings of the summer, as well as one of the best films of the year. And, for those of you who have followed me over the past two years, the mere fact that I am glowing over a mainstream blockbuster is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />The film opens in Lillian, Ohio in 1979, and follows a group of close-knit boys during summer break, as they attempt to film a zombie flick with a Super 8 camera. Young Joe Lamb has recently lost his mother in a steel mill accident, and as a way to cope with his loss, he vows to help his best friend, the film-obsessed Charles, complete his latest cinematic masterpiece. Together with three other boys, and his latest crush, Alice, Joe slowly begins a journey of self-discovery. Everything changes one night during a film shoot, when the boys witness, and barely manage to escape, a horrific train wreck. The kids flee the site, as the U.S. Air Force arrives.<br /><br />This leads to strange phenomena in the town; pets running away from their owners, the disappearance of car engines and power lines, and people being abducted. Soon after, the boys discover some disturbing footage which was caught during the train crash, while the camera was still rolling film. Something crawls up out the wreckage, and dashes out of the frame. The boys decide to delve into the mystery themselves, and the adventure begins.<br /><br />The performances in this film are amazing, especially from newcomer Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. Each delivers an incredibly genuine performance, and I was blown away by the raw energy displayed on screen. The direction is perfect, with splashes of J.J. Abrams idol, Spielberg, splashed about the screen in nearly every frame. The musical score is magical. The mystery is involving. It all makes for an excellent time at the theatre, and will make you long for the days when summer blockbusters had a soul. With strong messages of hope and forgiveness, it is also one of the most touching films to come out in a while.<br /><br />Super 8 is rated PG-13, and is 112 minutes.

review/text: This film was much better than I expected.  The acting was superb, the effects were also.  But it really had that 50's horror feeling, where you know the monster was there, but you never saw it, at least until the end.  It's too bad more movies are not made this way anymore.  Now it's all about the special effects, and getting the monster in your face. This movie harkens back to a time when directors understood that weak special effects were not the reason you didn't show the monster right from the beginning.<br /><br />There was nothing weak about the effects in this movie.  It is well done all the way through.  You will enjoy it.

review/summary: Not so like goonies & ET as people are saying
review/text: I keep seeing this compared to Goonies & ET. It's got it's similarities but it differs radically, and these differences may mean that it's not a good movie choice for kids. I'll explain below, plus here's the pros and cons of this movie:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The acting is phenomenal. The kids are just amazing. Each of them was absolutely believable and brought depth to their characters. I could totally relate to several of the kids. The adults were good as well, but they really weren't featured and developed enough to make a huge difference.<br /><br />2. The production value was amazing. What else would you expect from a Speilberg movie! The action sequences were riveting.<br /><br />3. The 1979 setting was very authentic and fun. Since I was around in that time period, it was great to see.<br /><br />4. The relationships between the kids were so well developed, and the main kids individual characters were beautifully written for and developed. This was what made the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />5. As in Goonies and ET, the kids are the heroes in this movie. They're the ones who know the truth and act on it for good. They're pure of heart, resourceful, determined and put themselves at risk to act like heroes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. This had a horror movie feel. There was plenty of violence, and it was scary. This movie is not for young kids. Those who don't like horror should avoid this movie. Granted most of it wasn't explicitly gory, but there was some blood and plenty of people died violently. There are many moments designed to shock, startle and scare you. Though it's rated PG-13, I'd say it feels closer to an R rating to me.<br /><br />2. If you're looking for a feel good alien like in ET, it's not here. The audience is not given much of a chance to emotionally connect with the alien. It's ugly, scary, violent and mysterious. I don't want to give anything away, but this is not a feel good, cuddle the alien, cute movie similar to ET. You may still enjoy this flick, but go in with the right expectations.<br /><br />3. There are tons of holes in the movie. There are many questions that are never answered, and a couple featured characters that are never fully explained. I don't always mind holes in movie lines if the movie is entertaining, but in this movie it was hard to ignore.<br /><br />4. The story line just wasn't that original. Take a bunch of different movies, put them in a jug and shake them together and you get this movie. I don't always mind a repeated story line if it's entertaining or moving, but this was just okay for me.<br /><br />So I'd say that if you like horror, this movie may be for you, though you may be disappointed with the lack of explicit gore. If you like scifi, this movie may be somewhat satisfying, but it probably won't be in your top 20. If you like coming of age movies, you'll love the story lines around the kids. If you love special effects, there are some good ones here. This movie is definitely not for young kids or for anyone who shouldn't be viewing horror.<br /><br />I'd say this is a video to rent on DVD. Then if you love it, buy it.

review/summary: Super 8 Made Me A Kid Again
review/text: I think of myself as extremely lucky to of been a little kid when I was in the 80s. It was the perfect time. I was experiencing first hand the filmmakers (and films) that formed my childhood (Spielberg, Lucas, Zemeckis, Dante, etc.) at the height of their powers. E.T., The Goonies, Back To The Future, Gremlins, Stand By Me, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Monster Squad, et al. Movies were magical. Going to them was an event. Standing in line was exciting. They stayed with you, and are still with you today. Sadly, that's been gone for a long time. Sure, there may be a summer blockbuster that's fun, but it doesn't have 'it'. Most are just empty, soulless CGI-fests that won't still be lauded 25 years from now. J.J. Abrams decided to do something about it. Let's get to it.<br /><br />Set in 1979, we meet Joe, a young boy who just suffered a horrible loss. He lives with his sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) and has a few friends. One night, he and his friends decide to go out and make their own zombie movie. While shooting down by the train tracks, they witness a horrible accident as a truck collides with an oncoming train in a truly spectacular crash. Little do our little friends know that they captured what was in the train's cargo, and mysterious and strange things begin to happen in town. I'll just stop there and let you experience the rest.<br /><br />"Super 8" is nostalgic and fun just not for the times, but for the type of filmmaking on display here. Spielbergian shots and lens flares, story over spectacle (although there is that), and real humanistic kids you instantly like, care for, and you want to see what happens to them. Back when kids were kids and they talked and acted like kids, just like those great films of the 80s. It was so refrshing to see this instead of the typical modern kids in movies who like so polished and like they just stepped off of the newest low rated CW show. These kids are from 1979, but I find them more relatable and interesting than anything I have seen in the last decade or more. Obviously, there is an homage to producer Spielberg here, and even though there is that, the film is still it's own movie. The fact that it appears to be a love letter to E.T.'s dad is not a deterrent. It's a great, new, original movie from J.J. wrapped in touches to Spielberg and other films from that era. And what touches. I can't say that I am familiar with Abrams' work. I have never seen anything he has ever done before. I will now! He is a director to be reckoned with here. The love and detail he puts into his scenes, characters, and era the film is set in, is so lovingly detailed. It's quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />"Super 8" harks back to a time when these films meant something to the audience. Meant something to the kids. Nowadays, it's all about cartoonish CGI, 3D, and what young adult novels a studio can get their hands on and everything else comes after. Abrams and company were brave to make an original and secretive film and release it in summer. Brave to actually make it with heart, passion, emotion, and characters that actually came first. The ending and eventual outcome may not of been as great as it could of been, but that's okay. With a movie this lovingly skilled and well done in every other place, and the fact they we just got such a film like this in the first place, made up for it for me. It's not going to take away anything from the movie. The acting is top notch. These kids are great. These are the best set of kids I have seen in a movie in a long time. The actors, most of whom have never been in a movie, just shine. Kyle Chandler also does very well in his role. Ron Eldard is also on hand. More brave points to Abrams for casting the movie with no real marquee name star.<br /><br />"Super 8" is an exceptional movie that really delivers what I was hoping it would. It's funny, sweet, adventurous, exciting, scary, and interesting. Is it too self indulgent in it's homages of films past? Of course not. A good movie is a good movie however it's told and made. It's a movie that we should embrace and hold dear because it's unlikely we are going to get another movie like this for a long time....if ever. Abrams and his cast and crew should be proud of the film they made. As a child of the 80s, this movie made me feel like a kid again. The first summer blockbuster movie I have seen in eons where I kept thinking about days afterwards. I really don't know what else to say except that "Super 8" is a gift.

review/summary: A Solidly Crafted Blockbuster For 2011
review/text: One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of "blockbuster" that has everything you could want, and something more.  And while that is becoming an increasingly rare species in the 21st century, every once in a while it happens.  SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011.<br /><br />Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids.  The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979.  Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman).  The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of it...until the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene.  Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this "incident", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate.  The local police, led by Kyle Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why.  Back in 1963, Turman had been a member of the Air Force involved in an Area 51-type of alien encounter, and had tried to help the aliens which had landed on Earth with their spaceship; instead, the Air Force not only dismissed him but tried to destroy any and all traces of his work.  The end result is a film that has plenty of mayhem, both human and alien alike, but ends on a largely hopeful note (even though some may be dissatisfied with that kind of a resolution).<br /><br />By setting the film back in 1979, Abrams bought us back to a world where Blackberrys, Blue Tooths, the Internet, and all other electronic communications devices either didn't exist yet or were merely in the planning stages, hence the presence of CB radios and the kids' use of Super-8 millimeter film for their proposed George Romero-type endeavor (and references, via posters on walls, to DAWN OF THE DEAD).  In many ways, SUPER 8 resembles THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY in that Abrams doesn't make it easy for the audience to figure out everything in one bold plot stroke, though he does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax).  And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic people than the adults.<br /><br />The presence of such great 1979 hits as "Heart Of Glass" (by Blondie) and "My Sharona" (by the Knack) amidst Michael Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days.  So even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just a blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself, though not slavishly imitative of him.

Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in "Super 8". Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of "The Goonies", "War of the Worlds", and "E.T.", but not in equal proportions.<br /><br />Abrams handles the "Goonies" component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe (home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.<br /><br />The "War of the Worlds" component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. Army into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the "E.T." aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the "Cloverfield" monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from "20 Million Miles to Earth". And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a picture of Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? "E.T." gets shortchanged here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time. If you are a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy it even more, and be more inclined to overlook its flaws.

review/summary: SUPER 8 - A masterful original story, with omage to Spielbergian Cinema.
review/text: As a kid who grew up in the late 70's and 80's watching films like ET, Jaws and Close Encounters I was destined to enjoy this movie. For me to say that Super 8 is a nostalgic and entertaining movie would be true. To say that Super 8 is a J.J. Abrams tribute to Spielbergian cinema would be partly true. Partly. There are so many parallels to story, characters, time period and genre that's it near impossible not to immediately start making connections to which Spielberg film is being referenced in any particular scene.<br /><br />That said, before I get into Spielbergia I must give J.J. Abrams his due as an original artist. Anyone who has watched American television the past decade knows Abrams can deliver solidly on story and character with series like Alias, Lost and Fringe under his belt. However, until now his feature film career has been rooted in existing properties like Mission Impossible III and the new Star Trek. Both highly entertaining and visceral films in my opinion. But with Super 8 being his first original screenplay for a feature film, in some ways this was uncharted territory for Abrams. But with someone like Spielberg as his collaborator and producer and Abrams litany of experience in film-making and storytelling its hard to imagine his first original feature being anything but what we would come to expect from him. Emotional, well plotted, well acted, funny and just plain entertaining.<br /><br />Now that we've gotten that out of the way lets get to the fun part - the Spielberg parallels! Here's the ones I spotted, in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The "catalyst" into Act 2 is a spectacular train crash. Any coincidence that the 1st movie Spielberg remember's seeing as a child was 'The Greatest Show on Earth', which also contains one of the biggest train crashes in movie history? In fact, that train crash is said to be what inspired an 8 year Spielberg to shoot his first film; 2 toy trains crashing into each other (also as a way to get away with seeing his toy trains crash over and over without getting them taken away by his father.) Notice the discussion in Super 8 about filming the toy trains crashing into one another, which ultimately they do.<br /><br />2. The obvious MILITARY parallel of Alien Life in Close Encounters being covered up by a staged viral outbreak that kills anyone or thing that breathes it causing town evacuation. This VS. the Military coverup of Alien Life in Super 8 being a staged grass fire that causes town evacuation.<br /><br />3. In JAWS the scariest thing about the shark is the NOT seeing it. Same is true in Super 8, we don't fully see the monster until the film is almost finished. Builds suspense much more effectively.<br /><br />3. Any coincidence the place that that the Alien in Super 8 makes his final takeoff into space from a water "tower". In Close Encounters the Alien Mothership arrives and takes off from Devil's "Tower", Wyoming.<br /><br />4. The town hall meeting in Super 8 is very reminiscent of the town hall meeting in Close Encounters. All citizens EXCEPT the sheriff seem to be clueless and way off base about whats really going on.<br /><br />5. The sound that the Alien makes is VERY similar to the sound of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park (as well as the sound of the dying truck in Spielberg's 1st feature 'Duel'.)<br /><br />6. The main kid, Joe doesn't make good grades, as evidenced by him throwing his C+ papers aside when the Alice sees them (this could easily be a J.J. Abrams childhood connection too however.)<br /><br />7. In ET & CLOSE ENCOUNTERS the alien makes a "psychic" connection of some kind with the people it interacts with. In ET its Elliott "feeling" what ET feels (i.e. classroom scene with frogs & Elliott getting drunk & Elliott getting sick when ET gets sick, etc.) In Close Encounters its Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon being obsessed with the image of Devil's Tower, which ultimately draws them to it. In Super 8 every human the Alien touches "sees" what the alien feels and has been through, thus sympathizing with it.<br /><br />8. In ET a group of underdog kids led by Elliott "save the day" for ET. In THE GOONIES a group of underdog kids led by Mikey "save the day" for Mikey's families home which is about to be sold and bulldozed. Same here in Super 8 with Joe, the main kid taking one of the cubes which is close enough to the Water Tower to be drawn to it, thus creating a foundation for the Alien's ship to work from. Remember all the other cubes had been taken away by the government until the very end. And Joe is the one who tell the Alien to "GO" and that he understands and that bad things happen and its OK. This could be seen as the alien's motivation to leave. (my brother mentioned a parallel to 'Stand By Me' underdog kids, which is also true.)<br /><br />9. Slight Spielbergian cinematography connections - 2:<br />  a. The way both the gas station attendant and the airfare bus driver are "pulled away" feet first screaming by the Alien is very similar to the first death in Jurassic Park, where the gatekeeper is "pulled away" feet first screaming by the Velociraptor.<br />  b. The side tracking dolly shots of the kids running through neighborhood "up and over" hills, fences, etc is very similar to side tracking dolly shots in ET of kids riding their bikes through neighborhood "up and over" hills, fences, etc trying to get ET to the forrest.<br /><br />10. And here are a random sampling of other various connections I saw to Spielbergian cinema - the use of smoke and light, the conversational cadence of the kids interrupting each other & using cuss words poorly, loss of a parent, military being overly "big brother" in hiding alien, tracking and dolly shots, overhead shot of bus. I could go on and on.<br /><br />Without question Super 8 has a multitude of connections and parallels to Steven Spielberg films but it is also good to keep in mind that good story elements are good story elements no matter when, where or who they are used by. Many times the good ones pop up over and over again, precisely for that reason, because they work. Overlap to previous archetypes or story mythologies is inevitable because the ones we like are the ones we like, whether they are set in space or in the old west. Good storytellers are drawn to these same archetypal stories, they just flavor them differently each generation. In summation, all of these parallels could simply be a MASTER STUDENT (Abrams) following his MASTER TEACHER (Spielberg) with such skill that it comes off as an omage, which it very well may be and does not keep it from being a truly original work.<br /><br />BONUS!<br /><br />#. Not a Spielberg omage but the name of the gas station KELVIN is the 2nd reference J.J. Abrams has made to his grandfather in a feature film, the 1st being the name of one of the spaceships in Star Trek (the "U.S.S. Kelvin") And of course all LOST fans know Kelvin is the name of the guy that was in the Swan Hatch before Desmond.<br /><br />#. Also not a Spielberg parallel, but the kids zombie file "The Case" pays omega to George A. Romero, the godfather of zombie films by naming the chemical plant 'Romero Chemicals'. Loved that.

review/summary: Pure excitement!
review/text: Some kids in a small Ohio town are filming a movie when they witness a train crash. Mysterious things begin to happen around town and the kids are right in the middle of all the occurrences. This is a very exciting science fiction drama that is sort of a cross between E.T. and Close Encounters. The acting, the visuals and the sound effects here are all top notch, and there is constant excitement throughout. The movie can be a little intense at times, so it may not be for children. If you are looking for pure escapism, and a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one.

review/summary: A well-rounded sci-fi thriller
review/text: J.J. Abrams is a writer/director/producer I can't quite get a read on. I never bothered with any of the TV series he was involved with ("Alias," "Lost," "Fringe") and after practically loathing Mission: Impossible II, I skipped III altogether. On the other hand though, Star Trek was pretty fantastic, Joy Ride sits comfortably in my collection of guilty pleasures, and Cloverfield was pretty decent at times. So Abrams work basically ranges from okay to amazing to me. So you can understand why my excitement for Super 8 was easy to contain. Trailers didn't reveal much of anything. Other than some kids making a zombie movie that witness a devastating train crash with some sort of extraordinary creature as its cargo being unleashed and the trailers giving off a big E.T. vibe, there wasn't much else to take away from it. That's the point with an Abrams project though; that key element is kept secret to pique interest and the payoff is usually something spectacular. Super 8 certainly delivers something worth waiting for.<br /><br />We spend most of the time with the kids of the film. If it's not the zombie film we're focused on, it's the friendship between Joe (Joel Courtney) and Charles (Riley Griffiths) or the relationship that develops between Joe and Alice (Elle Fanning). Something tragic happens to Joe and it's a story point that manages to make itself relevant throughout the course of the film. As you can imagine, the first half of the film is a little slow. Things crawl along while some depth is added to the characters. Character development is never something to be ashamed of.<br /><br />The train wreck is where things pick up. The sound effects used in the film are so loud, so distinct, and so precise that it makes you feel like you're actually there at that train station witnessing this horrific event in person. The sound utilized in the film is a huge drawing point for seeing the film in theaters. Explosions are felt not heard as the creature's screams seem to vibrate your very bones.<br /><br />Speaking of explosions, the special effects are also quite impressive. The teases leading up to the creature's big reveal draw a lot of interest. Cars being thrown in the air, heavy machinery being totally destroyed in an instant, something monstrous and inhuman being seen in reflective surfaces, and people screaming for their lives as something races across the screen and abducts them. But obviously the actual creature is the high point of the special effects. Look no further than the Kelvin gas station scene, the bus scene, or the entire finale for proof of this. As far as the creature is concerned, Cloverfield will probably be the first thing that comes to mind. But you actually get to SEE what was on that train and it's fairly astounding.<br /><br />The film is kind of like if E.T. and The Goonies were combined into one film along with bits of Cloverfield and Battle: Los Angeles injected into it. You know, if Battle: Los Angeles wasn't a total letdown.<br /><br />Super 8 is a rather brilliant sci-fi thriller. There's plenty of buildup and character development, which results in big action sequences having a bigger impact and actually makes you care about these characters when something goes wrong for them. The creature is teased for so long that when you do finally see it, it feels like a huge accomplishment. The cast of kids is really the heart of the film while Elle Fanning's exceptional acting puts her ahead of the pack. The film blindsides you in the gut with a strong assault of emotion that makes you reminisce the best and most memorable Steven Spielberg films. Not to mention the outstanding special effects and loud yet engaging use of sound. Super 8 is an emotionally powerful sci-fi film featuring a wonderful cast, solid storyline, immense sound effects, groundbreaking special effects, and some ridiculously awesome action sequences.

review/summary: light entertainment
review/text: I must be getting too old to watch Steven Speilburg. Maybe he is no longer the filmmaker he once was. I enjoyed this movie, and I was rooting for it, but in the end it was just a light snack, not a great meal. The actors were very good, even the youngest ones, the filming was very skillful, but I didn't get caught up in the story like I did once upon a time, when Speilburg and I were in our prime. There wasn't any magic. I don't mean a story about magic, I mean the magic in the story that makes you believe that it is real, makes you one with the actors, makes you forget that you have a life waiting for you when the story ends.<br /><br />I began to tire at the first big scene, when the train accident happened. It was too fantastical, wildly unrealistic. The rest of the story felt contrived. I can recommend this for an evening's entertainment. I just can't get excited about it. And that leaves me a little bit sad.

review/summary: Super 8 certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it
review/text: The film is wonderful, one of Spielberg's finest efforts. The fact that it didn't get released in 1979 (when it was made) is downright insane. But, after 32 years it has been released. It is a sci-fi story of a small town rocked by the mysterious after-effects of a model train's derailment amidst a zombie invasion. Simply a great movie to behold.<br /><br />As for the format of Super 8, it certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it. Many have argued that VHS was not available in 1979, but that cannot be verified. MICHAELmATICIAN has released several Sound Units of/concerning VHS (and never Super 8) from 1979. MICHAELmATICIAN did not comment on Super 8 (the film) and neither has Spielberg. Perhaps in another 32 years someone will speak of this 1979 classic. (Hopefully not J.J. Abrams)<br /><br />2.342 (Jeremy Shingles)

review/summary: E.T.'s Crystal Skull of the 3rd Kind
review/text: It's Spielberg, therefore we can expect ...<br />- Aliens (good. misunderstood)<br />- Children (wise, funny)<br />- Suspense (masterful, intriguing)<br />- Military (bad, always bad)<br /><br />I liked the first 2/3 of the movie better than the last 1/3.  A bit corny at the end, IMHO. Also, the CGI train crash was not very realistic -- too cartoonish!<br /><br />Spielberg purposely introduced a lot of blue glare lines and occasional spots & smudges on the lens (not the Super-8, but the big film cameras). I'm sure it was done as an after-effect to give the audience a sense of what filming was like during the Super-8 days, but frankly it was annoying!  If it showed up only on the brief Super-8 footage, it would have made more sense, but not on the high definition quality cameras used for most of the movie.  Enough with the blue lines across the screen already!!  Perhaps this is explained in the special features, but I hadn't gotten to those yet.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: If I was 8 or ten maybe this would be better. I feel a movie filmed mostly in the dark is done so they save money. Much of the time one does not know what is going on and can barely see the alien in any of the shots. How this is so highly rated is beyond me. Do American audiences expect so little? At least it did not have the usual bathroom humor or scenes of urination. I think this movie was weak if one compares it to other Spielberg films. He has rather insulted his abilities with this film. Compare it to E.T. or Stand By Me. I heard so much hype about this movie I really looked forward to watching. Now I am just disappointed. Glad I didn't spend a ticket price at the theatre. Definitely not a the producers best. I rented it from Amazon for only $1.99 which is all it is worth. Sorry folks. They should try again. Mr. Spielberg, you are worthy of so much more. Even the special effects are just copies of other recent movies that rely on cars and trucks flying through the air and/or blowing up. Really dumb...suspence....only about when was it going to end.

review/summary: Entertaining -- very derivative of ET and other Spielberg films
review/text: This is a reasonably entertaining film.  Its strong point is the acting of the young actors.  Many times actors under the age of around 15 simply cannot act; they mouth their lines pertly enough, but at the end of the day they are not convincing as characters.  These young actors can actually act, and seem like real people caught up in a real situation.  The plot kind of meanders along with the trademark Spielberg plot of an extraterrestrial situation that the bad US Government agents are trying to ruthlessly cover up.  We've seen it before.  I kept waiting for the kids to ride their bikes into the sky.  And that spaceship, I think I saw it somewhere before in a Richard Dreyfus film.<br /><br />The sub-plot of the fathers who are dealing with grief, albeit unsuccessfully, in different ways is carried off well, and some viewers will find this more interesting than the countless crashes, smash ups, etc. that relentlessly punctuate this film.  An enjoyable family film.  RJB.

review/summary: Works too hard to be Spielbergesque
review/text: This film is an obvious homage to the early films of Steven Spielberg, with JJ Abrams particular take: think E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Cloverfield. Unfortunately, in working so hard in trying to recreate what was so engaging about those early films, Super 8 ends up being a film that is an accumulation of scenes reminiscent, if not outright borrowed, from those early Spielberg gems, minus the emotional connection that made those Spielberg films so memorable and thus enduring.<br />I have admiration for JJ Abrams, as it is clear from the type of projects he chooses that we probably grew up watching alot of the same tv shows and movies that nurtured a generation of children from the 1970's thru the 1980's, and who are now adults in their 40's. It is clear that Abrams admires Spielberg and clearly was impacted as a filmmaker by his work. But this film somehow fails to capture the sense of wonder that was so appealing in films like E.T. and Close Encounters. I know some reading this might think that someone my age (40 on the nose) has lost some of their sense of wonder by this point, but this is simply not the case. I still marvel at and feel a sense of wonder towards creative projects that truly strike an emotional cord. In this case, Super 8 just didn't do this for me.<br />The film has a rather lackluster story line with weak and predictable dialogue that is more cliche' than original; the alien has no personality or likeability (it looks like a rejected creature design from Cloverfield); the special effects dazzle without adding any substance or reality (a train wreck scene that should have annihilated the entire cast of young actors even before the story begins to unfold); and adult actors whose performances are as flat as...well, as flat as a one dimensional piece of cardboard.<br />The real highlight of the film are the performances of the young actors playing the adolescent characters, but their performances get lost in cliche' dialogue far too similar to Spielberg's early scripts, and scenes that are staged as if they were literally shot during a film class entitled: Spielberg Film Techniques 101.<br />In general, I like Spielberg and I like JJ Abrams. However, overall, I did not like Super 8. If you want to see films that actually hit the marks that this movie is trying to hit then watch E.T. or Close Encounters. They still hold up extremely well as far as I'm concerned.<br />Super 8? More like Mediocre 8.

review/summary: An entertaining film
review/text: "Super 8" is director J.J. Abrams's tribute to Steven Spielberg's "E.T.," with a tip of his hat to Rob Reiner's "Stand By Me."<br /><br />The film takes place in 1979, with a group of pre-teenage and barely teenage kids--led by the overweight Charles (Riley Griffiths) making a Super 8mm movie about zombies for a film competition. The makeup specialist, Joe (Joel Courtney), falls in love--during the filming--with the female lead in the production, Alice (Elle Fanning). They are both sensitive--having lost their mothers.<br /><br />During a nighttime film shoot, a train is derailed, when it hits a truck that goes on the tracks, and explosions and intrigue ensue, with the Air Force soon appearing. Gradually (a bit too much so), we learn why dogs are running off to the next county, why people are vanishing, and why microwave ovens are missing.<br /><br />I liked the solid acting by the youthful cast, especially by Fanning and Courtney, who establish a very moving relationship with each other.<br /><br />Overall, this film held my interest fairly well and jolted me a few times as I munched on some popcorn. It will be worth watching again when Netflix has it, but I doubt I'll want to buy the DVD.

review/summary: Bad Things Happen to Good People
review/text: You might remember adventure films of your youth, where Middle America kids discovered amazing wonders and defeated great evils that only they could see.  These were the days of E.T., Goonies, and The Monster Squad, where kids laughed, cried, and fought while having adventures.  It's pretty much how adults remember their childhood summers, free of the soul-crushing realities of school, puberty, and adults. If you look back on your misspent youth in the early 80s with nostalgia, then Super 8 is for you.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams has seen those movies, and with papa Spielberg's blessings, wants you to see them too.  Although this film is ostensibly about a child (Joel Courtney as Joe) coming to grips with the death of his mother, it is not for children.  There's swearing, drug use, and violence - pretty much what you would expect from a film set in the early 80s. In fact, despite the lens flares, the out of focus camera work, and the soaring musical score, Super 8 distinguishes itself from other coming-of-age-with-aliens flicks with its unrelenting violence. The alien in Super 8 is big, mean, and angry, and he expresses that anger by eating people.<br /><br />The alien is a stand in for the adult rage that seethes throughout the town of Lillian, Ohio.  It's destroying father and widower Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) from the inside.  It haunts Louis Daniard (Ron Eldard), who was indirectly involved in the accident that killed Joe's mother.  And it is passed on to the children, manifesting with painful eloquence in Louis' daughter Alice (Elle Fanning, bred from a race of superactresses).  When Joe finally confronts the beast, boy and alien finally see each other for who they really are: innocents thrust into bad situations.  Will their tortured legacy define them o r will they rise above it?<br /><br />Heady stuff for a movie, and Abrams' deft movie-making elevates a straightforward plot that might otherwise be lost in the alien-invasion morass.  The film is beautifully shot and, for the most part, tightly scripted.  But once boy and alien face off, the movie loses a lot of its momentum.<br /><br />Lurking throughout the military vs. townies vs. alien conflict is a hope of redemption for both Louis and Jackson.  This redemption is found in a car ride rescue by the parents, who of course don't rescue the kids at all.  Basically, the two guys could have had a beer and come to the same conclusions, but for pacing purposes it happens in a car.<br /><br />And that's where Super 8 isn't quite as successful. The ending struggles to mash the alien's resolution with a father and son reunited, complete with a symbolic locket of motherly love. It feels a bit forced, which detracts from an otherwise pitch perfect tale about filmmaking, death, and meeting girls.<br /><br />With less warmth than E.T. but a better script than Signs, Super 8 is a nostalgia-fueled trip for fans of horror and sci-fi who remember using words like "mint." Everyone else might be a little bored.<br /><br />Except for zombie fans.  Zombie fans will be pleased.

review/summary: Lens flares for all!
review/text: Back when I was growing up there was a young filmmaker known for great movies like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial. These were wonderful movies. The first was scary, the second was thought-provoking and the third was excellent family entertainment. As the 1980's came along, this filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, made other fine works, like the Indiana Jones series and in the 1990's gave us Jurassic Park. Then he discovered World War II, and that was basically then end of him making "genre" films that appealed to a wide audience.<br /><br />But apparently I wasn't the only one who had fond memories of Spielberg's earlier career. JJ Abrams, noted as the man who made Lost and directed the Star Trek reboot, seems to also have those sorts of good memories. So he teamed up with Spielberg and made Super 8, a film which, aside from the modern special effects, would not seem out of place in Spielberg's resume.<br /><br />Super 8 centers around events in small-town Ohio in 1979. Joe Lamb is a young boy whose mother has died at the start of the film. Four months later he and his friends are making a zombie movie when they inadvertently bear witness to a massive (and extremelyunrealistic), train derailment. They escape with their lives, unaware that something else has escaped, too. Soon all the town's dogs disappear, only to turn up in nearby towns. The Air Force arrives to clean up the train mess and begins basically overtaking the town (and get away with massive lies, because if there's one thing we know about the 1970's, it's that investigative journalism didn't really exist and trust in the government was absolute). Then various items and people start to disappear and the action gets ramped-up to eleven, leading to an unnecessarily action-heavy third act.<br /><br />At its core this is a movie about the relationship between a young boy, his friends and a girl that he's starting to develop a crush on. The movie is at its finest when it shows these kids just being kids. When it shows them hanging out chatting in a diner and teasing each other like kids do. When it shows them sneaking out of their homes to film at night. When it shows them being appalled/overjoyed that they're actually breaking into their school during summer vacation. These moments, as well as the ones highlighting Joe's somewhat complicated relationship with his father, also the town deputy and person in charge after the sherrif disappears), are the true heart of the film.<br /><br />Those moments also make the moments of action, which include the military going nuts in the middle of the town, completely unnecessary. Those scenes add nothing to the plot, really, aside from creating some artificial peril for our heroes to deal with. Really one could edit out all the military elements and be left with a good, solid, summer science fiction film for the whole family. Also, having gone nuts with the action sequence, I feel that Abrams missed a really opportunity to kill off one of the kids. Harsh? Maybe, but it might have added something to the film. But consider the one of the pivotal moments of Jaws is when a six-year-old boy is gruesomely eaten by the shark.<br /><br />I also need to make mention of Abrams as a director. He's good at what he does. He's very good at what he does. But he's never met a lens flare he didn't like, and frankly it's really, really distracting. If you thought scenes in Star Trek overused the lens flare, just you wait. Abrams really goes nuts with it in this movie and it does not add anything to the film.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a very good movie, and I'd said it's suitable for pretty much the entire family.

review/summary: Spielberg film history, all in one place...
review/text: I should start by saying I really did like this movie, basically because I like Steven Spielberg movies in general.  But after a while it started looking like a "who's who" of his past (albeit great) films, and a big part of the enjoyment became trying to spot the next "cameo" by a previous scene, plot device, or character.  We have the "clever-kids-who-know-way-more-than-the-clueless-adults" of just about every Spielberg movie ever made (ET comes most to mind, for obvious reasons); we have Chief Brody from Jaws (a Sheriff's Deputy this time instead of a Chief of Police, and Lillian, Ohio instead of Amity Island, but you get the idea); we have vehicles driving down a dark, star-covered road in the middle of nowhere when mysteriously all the power goes out (Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, anyone?); we have a baddie/villain/whatever-it-is that we see more and more of as the film progresses (Jaws again); we have dinner-table scenes with kids behaving more wild and out-of-control than any reasonable parent would ever let their kids behave (Close Encounters, again?); and I won't give any spoilers, but suffice to say that the film concludes in a very true-to-form Spielbergian mode.  And let's not forget the 2 inescapable contributions by JJ Abrams -- excessive and intrusive lens flares everywhere you turn (Star Trek?), and the moody (and beautiful) music by Michael Giacchino (L O S T).  But I did like it -- very fun way to spend a summer Saturday afternoon

review/summary: Diverting summer fun
review/text: With the combined talents of JJ Abrams and a certain Mr Spielberg behind "Super 8," together with the science fiction theme, it was a movie I just had to see.  It turned out to be an entertaining enough movie, though not quite in the same league with such Spielberg sci-fi classics as E.T. and Close Encounters, and maybe not even as good as Mr. Abrams' update of the Star Trek franchise.  Still, the movie was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed its nod to the '60s 'B' movies where the army is fighting the alien invaders (or giant ants, or whatever).  Plus there was the familiar element of a small town dealing with an unknown threat to its existence.  There were also many heartwarming and/or humorous moments of the type that fans of those previous Spielberg classics will recognize, and the little romance between the two young people was nice.  However, the scenes of the middle school heroes were a bit too repetitive (ex., too many scenes of the young director demanding that they get back to making his movie).  That detracted slightly from my level of entertainment with Super 8.  Also, there is no shortage of special FX shots in this flick, but few of them were noteworthy.  A couple of impressive scenes near the end are an exception to this observation.  Otherwise, it was just a lot of stuff flying through the air, blowing up, and/or getting smashed and knocked around.  Finally, the plot plot just felt a bit too casually thrown together, never fully engaging my interest at the level to make this film truly memorable.  I almost went a star lower with my rating, but I left the theater feeling I'd had a good time, and that was enough to get me to 4 stars.<br /><br />An additional note:  Make sure you stick around for the credits!  If you leave when they begin, you'll miss an amusing look at something very relevant to the story.

review/text: I would have given this movie 5 stars if it hadn't been so dark in parts that I couldn't see what was happening.  The story and the characters are good, and I liked seeing Elle Fanning in it.  I had a hard time following the story line in some parts, and it's not very clear to me why the creature had to destroy the town and so many people. I know it just wanted to go home, but the destruction didn't make a lot of sense.  Maybe if I see it again, I'll pick up more.  It is interesting and it makes you want to find out what happens to the kids, but when they are in the cave (or whatever that place is) it get confusing, which is something of a disappointment.  But I will watch it again and see if I can "get" it.  The actors are all good in their respective roles, but the plot is just sort of.. meh.<br /><br />Oh yea, and I liked Kyle Chandler in this, too. It was nice to see him again.  Joel Courtney in the lead was really engaging, too.  I would say that the actors deserve 5 stars, if only it weren't for the confusing plot.

review/summary: Decent "Family" movie but not for the hardcore fans of scifi
review/text: Well, Super 8 isn't a bad movie and it's not amazing either. It's a 3.5 but I'll round up instead of down. The story focuses on a group of Junior Highschool children making a independent film. During the film they get caught in the middle of a disaster and that's where the story begins. Super 8 Mixes The Goonies, with Godzilla (that horrible remake one) and E.T.. If you think that's a strange and unexpected mix well, this movie is just that. It's has it's serious moments (mostly drama) but it has it's lighthearted moments too. The Alien doesn't make its full on screen appearance until later in the film but like Godzilla it can be seen in the shadows running around and tearing up the town. There is action in the movie but in between that action is adolescent drama that results in long drawn out scenes. These scenes just make you wonder what the Alien is doing while the characters on screen are crying out their feelings.<br /><br />Overall Super 8 is a decent family movie and worth checking out if your board but but just don't expect to blown away by it.

Be forewarned, the audio is very low but the action scenes are extremely loud so be prepared.

review/text: Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1<br />French, Portuguese, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish.<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br />BD-Live<br />D-Box<br /><br />Playback:<br />Region free<br /><br />Although it's listed as a science fiction thriller, Super 8 is an ideal family movie. The main characters are children and we are given enough information to identify with them. Even if we weren't like any of them ourselves, we almost certainly went to school with similar children.<br /><br />The movie feels like a combination of Stand by Me and some of the best Steven Spielberg stories, such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The story feels like it could have been written by Stephen King and contains a slice of small-town America, combined with a fantasy element.<br /><br />The opening scene mentions an accident at a steel mill in which Elizabeth Lamb is killed. Her husband, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is a deputy, and her son, Joe (Joel Courtney), is helping his friends make a movie. We spend a lot of time with these children and events are seen from their viewpoint. The group enlists Alice (Elle Fanning) to play a role in their movie and she impresses them with her superior acting ability. Joe starts to develop feelings for her and it's this relationship which drives the story.<br /><br />One of the most memorable scenes comes early in the movie. While the kids are filming, a train approaches. Charles (Riley Griffiths), who is the director, wants to shoot a scene while the train is passing. A truck drives onto the tracks in front of the train and causes a massive accident. The scene is spectacular and will rock your home theater. After surviving the accident, the kids notice a carriage on its side and something is pounding on the walls from within.<br /><br />That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story. Courtney and Fanning give strong performances and their developing friendship is believable. Alice's father is a source of conflict and Joe's father has a role to play in the safety of the town. Part of the fun is watching events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. What is causing these things to happen? Why are people and animals disappearing?<br /><br />Super 8 evokes a special feeling. It's partly nostalgia as we remember friendships in our childhood, and the movie feels as if it belongs in the 70s or early 80s. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is now and there is a closeness between the people in the town that is rare to see in today's world. The friendship between the children makes everything work and it feels authentic.<br /><br />Although the early part of the movie relies on special effects, there is a real story here with a little depth. If you like Spielberg's classic movies, you'll probably enjoy what Abrams has done. If you were wondering whether Abrams includes lens flares like he did in Star Trek, they are present throughout the movie.

review/text: The review from Amazon.com was spot on. The movie tries to hard to seem like it was filmed in 1979, put a filter over the camera lens for goodness sake enough with the glare. The kids in the film do a good job of acting however the generic "fat kid" gets annoying after a while. The story is pretty basic, alien escapes train wreck and tries to leave earth. Don't expect to see much of the alien creature, i would say 5 minutes of screen time tops, but the overall special effects are great and are done by Spielberg buddy ILM. If you want to watch a movie that makes you think of late 70's early 80's sci-fi then this is the movie for you.

review/summary: Super 8 = Super Great!
review/text: This is a wonderful movie for many reasons. Super 8 centers around a group of kids in the late 70's filming a movie. However, after a major accident, the focus turns from filming their movie to trying to figure out what is going on in town. Things disappearing, animals acting strangely, and an outside presence entering town all let you know something strange is happening in the small quiet town of Lillian. During their movie-making process and investigation into the mystery, the group of friends becomes closer and even deal with issues that teenagers still face in the present. The young cast in the movie are all very talented. Joel Courtney leads the way (in his debut acting role no less!) as Joe Lamb, a teenager struggling to connect with his father in their single parent household. He also has to deal with his first crush and conflict with friends as he learns to become a leader and someone who can take charge in a difficult situation. His facial expressions are phenomenal as he displays a wide variety of feelings perfectly and is more than capable of delivering emotionally charged dialogue. Such a great first acting role, expect Joel Courtney to be acting for many years to come. Next is Elle Fanning, who plays the only girl (Alice Dainard)among the group of friends and who has troubles at home of her own. Look for an amazing scene between her and Joel in the middle of the movie where both showcase their emotional depth and may very well move you to tears. Riley Griffiths plays the bossy director of their film (Charles), yet is also capable of showing a more vulnerable side in Super 8 as well. Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, and Gabe Basso play the remaining 3 friends in the group (Cary, Preston,Martin)and each gets a chance to show off their comedic skills and add a lot of humor to the movie, especially Ryan. While the resolution to the movie (and the end of the mystery)may seem to come about suddenly, the message behind it is very meaningful and full of symbolism. Overall, a delightful movie

review/summary: It's Like THE GOONIES crossed with E.T. with a touch of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
review/text: Set during the summer of 1979 in a small town in Ohio, SUPER 8 revolves around Joe Lam (Joel Lamb) and his friends as they attempt to finish a Super 8 zombie movie for an upcoming Super 8 Film Festival.  While filming one night at the local train station, the boys and the star actress of their production are witness to and somewhat involved with a horrible train accident that unleashes a mysterious creature. Soon after, all the dogs in the town run away, people start disappearing, and all kinds of pieces of electronics and machinery are stolen. Oh, and the military has moved in and blocked off the area around the train crash. While watching footage that was shot on the night of the crash, Joe and his friends make a startling discovery. The boys attempt to finish their movie while at the same time solving the mystery of the alien creature.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is a sci-fi movie that has very little to do with sci-fi. Instead, the movie is more of an action movie drama that's about relationships. The core of the movie is about the relationship between Joe and his friends. They are a close knit group of companions, but you know that after high school they will go their separate ways, perhaps some of them never to meet again. At the same time, you know that some of the friends will be friends throughout life.<br /><br />Besides being a movie about the relationship between childhood friends, SUPER 8 is also a movie about family. The movie begins in an incredibly depressing manner with the death of Joe's mother, her funeral, and the immediate aftermath. After her death, Joe and his dad (Kyle Chandler) attempt to hold on while forging ahead; adjusting to the new normal after the death of a close loved one is extremely difficult. There's also the relationship between Joe's love interest, Alice (Elle Fanning) and her own father (Ron Eldard). In a completely different vein, there's also the budding relationship between Joe and Alice. Oh, and there's the whole thing about our own relationship as humanity with other creatures (in this case an extraterrestrial creature).<br /><br />I really enjoyed SUPER 8. It's one of my favorite movies from 2011. The movie was directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. I felt the film was a decent film on its own. It's a nice little story with some great moments of acting. However, what sticks out most about the movie is the overwhelming since of nostalgia that swathes every inch of the film like a college dorm reeking of potpourri incense. The movie isn't just a homage to the late 1970s and early 1980s, it's a full blown love song that blares out over Abrams's film boom box as he stands outside Steven Spielberg's office. There were a lot of movies made in the 1980s that were Spielbergian in tone or style. However, in the past twenty years, not even Steven Spielberg has made many Spielbergian movies. SUPER 8 resurrects the Spielbergian-style of filmmaking. The movie pays homage to a slew of other films (and in some cases outright steals from some): E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and THE GOONIES are easily the largest influences. However, there are several others including JURASSIC PARK, JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD, JAWS, GREMLINS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Also, the zombie movie the boys are making, "The Case" has several references to George Romero and his zombie films.<br /><br />Like most of Steven Spielberg's and J.J. Abram's previous works, not everyone will enjoy SUPER 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone (probably most particularly those over the age of sixty). Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in SUPER 8 especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.<br /><br />The DVD of SUPER 8 doesn't include many extras. There's the usual commentary with director J.J. Abrams and some of his crew. Done correctly, this often can be one of the most rewarding extras of a DVD. However, in this case, the commentary is incredibly boring. Abrams and his buddies croon about Spielberg throughout, there are long pauses throughout where there is no commentary or discussion, and there really isn't any new information revealed that wasn't already available in the promotional materials for the movie and DVD. The other special features include a short featurette with Abrams and his crew entitled "The Dream Behind SUPER 8". That featurette was more exciting that the DVD commentary. There's another featurette entitled "The Visitor Lives: Creating the Creature" that features the main creature designer for the alien. This is an interesting look at the process of how the alien came to be created. Lastly, there are a series of trailers for upcoming and soon-to-be released movies.

review/summary: 3.5 more than a 3 but Derivative of ET and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
review/text: Amazon will not give us half stars to use yet this should be a 3.5 star movie for me, not a 3 but not a 4 either.<br /><br />ET was a magical moment in movie making from Spielberg.  Before that he made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  Both films are five star classics.  This is his production but made by a younger director whom he picked. It is not that this movie is bad, it is that it made me sad that there will probably be no more groundbreaking five star films from him in this genre. This film has the family life of both films.  It has got the alien but he is not much onscreen. It has the ship, straight out of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. The visuals at the ending are almost verbatim from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. Basically it is a movie about a group of youngsters making a super eight film in 1979 about zombies, who have a close encounter with an alien.  This happens when they  witness a colossal train wreck.  The train wreck is really impressive. I was actually quite taken with the original premise, of the kids making the zombie picture in super 8.  That could have been a much fresher, more original film had the alien aspect of the story not taken over from the train wreck forward.  I think it could have been a classic like Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME if they had stuck with the kids and their movie adventures.  I hadn't seen Elle Fanning recently.  She is the girl teenager and she is every bit as gorgeous as a teenager as she was as a kid.

review/summary: Expected greatness, and I got it.
review/text: When I told my mom about Super 8, I mentioned it was probably one of my favorite movies of the past several years. Then, I had her watch it. Her reaction was particularly funny, because she was thinking period drama, and Super 8 may be a period piece (1979) and it may be a drama (if a Science Fiction one), but it was certainly not what she meant...<br /><br />Super 8 was a huge dose of nostalgia for the great movies I grew up with. Child actors who engage on a journey of excitement and growth - much like Goonies or ET.<br /><br />In 1979 in a small town, there's a horrifying train crash. The train appears to have had something large and scary aboard!  Our heroes are a young filmmaker and his friends who are working on a zombie movie.<br /><br />Like all sci-fi films, a suspension of one's disbelief is necessary - the train crash scene, while exciting and done really well, was so unrealistic in cause and effect, that one has to view it through a child's eyes.<br /><br />Super 8 has some action, several scares, impressive special effects, a little bit of pre-teen romance, and some fabulous one-liners.<br /><br />Written and directed by J J Abrams and Produced by Stephen Spielberg, I was expecting greatness, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're wondering, my mom thought the movie was really good, too.

Abrams who has elevated himself in the mediums of film (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68800">Mission: Impossible III</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWRYJE">Star Trek</a>) and television (Alias, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVWRNY">Felicity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNOG">Lost</a>) has become one of Hollywood's biggest and brightest directors waiting in line to become the next Steven Spielberg or James Cameron. Super 8 seems to combine his overly-commercial efforts with Steven Spielberg's filmmaking style while bringing elements first seen with the Abrams-produced film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OQG">Cloverfield</a>. In fact, it was rumored that Super 8 was a Cloverfield sequel or prequel considering the similarity of the topic of a large monster breaking through a large city or town.<br /><br />The mood of Super 8 is heavily reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a> and the comradery of the kids in the film is similar to that of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J6UP">The Goonies</a>. The film takes place in the early 1980s (the same time of Spielberg's science fiction epic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2IPP0">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</a>). The premise follows a group of young teenagers as they attempt to make a zombie-related short film using a Super 8 camera. As they engage in their amateur filmmaking, they witness a suspicious train crash that they capture on tape. Soon, strange disappearances take place all over town and dogs and cats are scattering in all directions. The subplot deals with the main character Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who is living with his single father after the death of his mother, which his father blames on Louis (Ron Eldard). Joe develops a forbidden relationship with Louis' daughter (played beautifully by Elle Fanning). All the while, their town is surrounded by military forces that seem to be covering up something that Joe and his friends get dangerously close to.<br /><br />The small shocks and developments that come along the way are done in an exceedingly satisfying way. And while I would have preferred Abrams to have tackled something his own rather than copy Spielberg, the replication of Spielberg is uncanny whether it be elements of Close Encounters, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N3P6SY">Empire of the Sun</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>. In the film, kids make a voice for themselves by engaging in a productive past time. Like many of Spielberg's works with kids, the possibilities the kids have in the film are endless. Whether they are driving cars or successfully interacting with aliens, the kids can do anything, a great message for a growing generation with increasingly limited economic choices and chances for advancement.<br /><br />Technically, the film is flawless. The cinematography is more than appropriate and the editing is precise. The acting of Elle Fanning stands out with her honestly conveying emotion even if her character is just doing it for the camera. The kids, (one in particular), tends to curse a lot and there is some drug use in the film. However, kids have always done this but this was often kept from the big screen. The monster is not terribly ugly or overly frightening especially in comparison to Clover and his little parasites. J.J. Abrams like Mission: Impossible III and Star Trek delivers an easily satisfying blockbuster that stands above the rest.

review/summary: Streaming: beware the 43:00 mark!
review/text: First off, this movie entertained me far more than I expected it to - well worth the rental fee, particularly in HD as the effects were stunning. Very good acting, and the plot kept us guessing right up until the end. LOVED IT! I have to wonder who this movie is for though? The cast of mostly children gives it a Goonies/ET feel (which is why I wasn't very interested at first) but it seemed to be WAY too scary for actual children that age. These are not cute charming aliens, folks! Very entertaining & enjoyable for me but make sure kids are old enough to handle it before letting them see it.<br /><br />We had a recurring problem with the streaming video. Every time we got close to the 43-min mark, the video stopped and went black & silent. Then it went back to the home screen for the film, where we could click "Watch" and it would go all the way back to the beginning. Our internet connection is not immune to dropping a signal, but the fact that it happened multiple times in the exact same spot in the movie makes me believe there was something wrong with the Amazon server. Finally we just forwarded the video all the way past that part (to around the 45 min mark) and it continued until the end without dropping. We missed only about 2 min of the film but having to start it over again three times was pretty irritating. Really takes you out of the story!

review/summary: A movie about relationships.
review/text: This reviews is heavy with spoliers. This is a relationship movie. Often summer popcorn type movies have been criticized for lack of character development and this movie, with some exceptions, is creatively different. The relationships in the movie are  interwoven with a compelling science fiction plot involving the sabotage of a military train transporting an alien from Area 51. Once the alien is let loose on this small American town many strange events begin occurring that impact the struggles the human characters are already experiencing.<br /><br />The central character in the film is 14 year old Joe Lamb who lives in a small town in Ohio. At the start of the film we discover that Joe has just lost his mother in an industrial accident at the factory she worked.  As a typical young teen Joe is heavily involved with his friends, chief among them is Charles Kaznyk who is passionate about the zombie movie they are all making on a super 8 camera for a local film competition. The lead actress in Charles's zombie movie is Alice "Ellie" Dainard on whom Joe has a crush. But this budding romance is the center of further pain and controversy for Joe. Alice's father, Louis Dainard, is an abusive alcoholic and it is revealed that the day Joe's mother died she was covering a shift that Louis was unable to work due to his drunkenness. This fact cause problems between Joe and his father, Jack, a deputy sheriff and the relationship between Joe and Alice also furthers the already strained relationship between Louis and his daughter Alice. The budding young romance also puts strain on Joe's friendship with Charles when it is revealed that he too has a crush on Alice.<br /><br />The conflicts of these relationships play out as the town is under siege from an alien which has escape when the train it is being transported on is derailed by a high school teacher,  Dr. Woodward, who had been involved in secret government projects where the alien had been abused and cruelly treated as scientists were performing tests on it. Joe, Alice, Charles and their other friends witness the train wreck as they are filming their super 8 zombie movie. Soon strange things be happening. Power lines and townspeople begin disappearing along with dogs running away as the military arrive without saying a word to what really was on that train. The military unit searching for the alien is headed by Colonel Nelec who was also part of the team performing tests on the creature in the early 1960s. Joe's father is arrested by Colonel Nelec when he begins asking too many questions. Events take a turn for the worst when Alice is abducted by the alien after an argument with her father.<br /><br />When examining their recently developed film footage of their zombie movie they glimpse the alien creature that has abducted the townspeople, including Alice, and been causing the strange events in town. Joe and his friends proceed to break into the school to find out all they can about this creature by investigating Dr. Woodward's office. Watching films, reading documents and listening to tapes they discover that this alien has been tortured and tested by its human interrogators and its only desire is to repair its ship and go home. At this point the military comes crashing into the school and incarcerating  the kids. While locked in a bus on the way back to where the military has set up camp the creature attacks the bus killing  Colonel Nelec. The children escape unharmed and eventually uncover the lair beneath the water tower where the alien has held the people he abducted and where he is repairing the ship. After setting the people free Joe has a confrontation with the alien telling him its alright ot leave and that he should go. The movie ends with the mysterious cube material repairing his sip and the alien leaves.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent and the film really captures what it was like to be 14 in 1979. I was about the same age at that and have fond memories of the period. Except for the villain, Colonel Nelec, all the other characters are multidimensional and complex. The relatively unknown actors playing the young kids are very convincing and it comes across very naturally. When they are having lunch together the next day after the train derailment they are trying to discuss the situation but they still can't help but being kids and acting goofy and childlike in their confrontations with one another. It is a delightful scene. I think the stand our performances are from the lead actors, Joel Courtney as Joseph "Joe" Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice "Allie" Dainard, Kyle Chandler as Jack Lamb Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard, Riley Griffiths as Charles Kaznyk. Elle Fanning  particularly stands out not only in the film itself but as an actress within the zombie movie being filmed. She displays that there is deep acting talent in the Fanning family. The movie has a lot of heart and you really get to see inside of their emotions in the film. You also get to see them change, grow and mature because of the events they face.<br /><br />My only negative complaint about the film is the lack of one relationship. That is the relationship between the alien creature and the children and in turn we the audience. JJ Abrams likes the mystery element to movies and wants to keep the alien a mystery and to a large extent that works. Although the creature is revealed, wonderfully created by Neville Page, it is so late in the film that we never really get a chance to develop any emotional connection to the creature. It is this shadowy figure lurking in the dark in which we only get small glimpses of from time to time. Although we do learn the alien's story in bits and pieces along the way more interactions between the creature and the children would have provided more of an emotional connection. If we had more of a connection to the creature the ending would have provided more of an emotional punch. Plus, to be honest, I am a nerd about these things and monster and alien movies are among my favorite types of science fiction stories so when you have such a great creature design and top notch special effects I would like to see more of the creature! But all in all a very good movie by JJ Abrams and one I will watch over and over.

review/summary: "Production value!!"
review/text: SUPER 8 (prod. Steven Spielberg, writ./dir. J. J. Abrams, 113 minutes, 2011) - Every now and then comes a film that is so much fun, so compelling, suspenseful, moving and well acted that you do not care how dumb and derivative it may be. SUPER 8 is not just your ordinary alien-monster-devours-a-town film. This has nostalgia, heart, Oscar-caliber acting and a director who has inherited the Flame from Spielberg.<br /><br />Charming, sweet young Joe Lamb (15-year-old Joel Courtney in his first major role) has lost his mother in an accident. It is circa 1979, in the hamlet of Lillian, Ohio (West Virginia served as the location). To alleviate the pain, he and his pals assist their pushy fellow junior high student in the making of a Super 8 zombie film. Witnessing a train accident at their prime location, the kids barely escape with their lives - not knowing what the wreck has unleashed. The train wreck has to be one of the most spectacular sequences ever filmed.<br /><br />Joe and his friends will discover much about extraterrestrial life before their week is finished - and it is here the film is at its most powerful. The kids are dead set on finishing their Super 8 film in time to submit it to an Ohio film contest. Having shot similar stuff in the mid-1970s, I can tell you: nothing stops a filmmaking obsession. Not even a giant, slimy alien.<br /><br />Although the attempts to get the kids talking right was a bit of a failure (kids did not say "totally, dude" in the 1970s, and this is just the tip of the anachronisms iceberg) - and the story certainly could have ended a bit better - it was all worth it. Abrams, while not slapping or shimmying the camera so much, is in full force with his trademark deliberate camera flare. It adds to the atmosphere, as does the rich cinematography and the location of a little old town.<br /><br />This is the first film I know of attempting to show us the elite cadre of budding filmmaking kids in the 1970s, and the Super 8 film festival culture. Spielberg, though he's approximately a fellow of my generation, filmed the same kinds of zombie flicks as a kid. Abrams pays deep homage to Spielberg; the pity about Spielberg not directing is that this might have been seen as a major comeback for him as a director. Oh well.<br /><br />Don't miss the kids' finished, hilarious Super 8 film, "The Case", which is shown in all its glory during the final credit roll. This goofy, 1950s-style monster flick is just the tonic we need in this frazzled era. My only wish is Abrams and Spielberg will keep up the good work.<br /><br />Featuring the talents of Noah Emmerich, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard, the sweet soon-to-be-a-superstar Elle Fanning (her sister Dakota had a split-second cameo as did Abrams) and Glynn Turman as Dr. Woodward.

review/summary: Fantastic... Right up until the end
review/text: I absolutely loved this film, saw it in the theater three times because the kids were so good. I felt that the mood and the feel of 1980 was spot on. I very much identified with them... I thought to myself 'this is exactly what it was like being a kid in those days' and loved every second. The kids' banter was well written and sounded like actual kids, not watered down... The dad's frustration with the son felt so believable... And the effects were awesome.<br /><br />But... (spoiler)<br /><br />Couldn't there have been a better ending? It would have been a simple thing to do to have the kid simply find some crucial part of the spaceship hidden in the dead teacher's storage bin... Or something like that... Couldn't they have helped in SOME way? The dad was running around like a super hero on a mission, and i couldn't wait to see how it was going to wrap up, how the dad and the kids would come together and save the day... And they simply 'met up' in town, just in time to see the alien depart. There was no feeling of 'finally the alien can go, because he met the nice kid and his friends.' it was kind of a let down...<br /><br />Again, i will buy it because it was SO great otherwise... But it could have been a masterpiece.

review/summary: Super Nostalgia for Blockbusters Like This One
review/text: FILM RATING:  3.5 stars<br /><br />What I really love the most about writer/director J.J. Abrams' new film Super 8 (2011) is how it made me so fondly reminisce and wax nostalgic for the great, but sometimes a bit "cheesy" (in hindsight), movies I grew up loving in the 1980s. Like The Goonies (1985), E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Explorers (1985), and even Stand By Me (1986).  Abrams has woven together a good story here about five childhood friends who love hanging out and making movies...at least when they're not quarreling and making fun of each other. It's an homage to himself and executive director Steven Spielberg (and many more of us), who grew up much like these kids, making their own homemade movies. Set in the 1970s, the kids especially like making zombie and horror movies, recording them on their own Super 8mm film camera with a microphone taped to the end of a broomstick "boom". These boys are all geeks and misfits, like we all really were when we were their age. Come on...admit it...you were an awkward kid too!<br /><br />With legendary writer/director/producer Spielberg on board this project as both producer and "Godfather", you kind of knew something magical, and a bit cheesy, would happen in this film. I just wish it was a bit more magical in the story and character development, and less magical in the visual effects, lens flare, and alien aspects. Don't get me wrong, I liked all of that stuff, and I think Super 8 is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. But I also can't help feeling that the third act of the film fell apart. I think once the "Area 51 Surprise" is introduced visually, the film gets weaker. And the fun relationships and bonds that the five boys have, along with their girl crush addition to the group (played by Elle Fanning), kind of melts. Still, there is a lot to love in this summer blockbuster. For one, it's original material that isn't based on a comic book or toy, and it isn't a sequel or remake. Super 8 seems to be the Inception of this year. It's smart, stylistic, and filled with cool visual effects and a great ensemble cast that gives excellent performances. Kudos to Abrams for a well-written script...at least for most of the movie.<br /><br />The first act of the film brings with it some of the best performances by a group of kids I've seen in awhile. All five of the boys, led by newcomer Joel Courtney, create an energetic group dynamic that allows each to feed off the other...snapping sarcastic and sharp dialogue that definitely made me feel like a kid again. And paradoxically feel both the awkwardness and greatness of that time in my life. Kyle Chandler, as the single widowed father of Joel's character Joe, and the police officer who gets to the bottom of the train wreck and it's supernatural circumstances, delivers a solid performance that gels the focus on family built into Abrams script. The same can be said for the supporting role played by Ron Eldard as the single alcoholic father of Elle's character Alice. The entire cast of Super 8 feels right and supports Abrams very strongly in bringing the script to life.<br /><br />One of director J.J. Abrams strengths is bringing together an incredible crew of talented artists and technicians who create productions of the highest quality. While the rumored budget for Super 8 was only $50 million, this movie looks and feels like a $100 million plus production. The production design, cinematography, music, sound, and visual effects are all well executed and support the story perfectly. I felt completely transported back to the 1970s, or at least to my imagination of what the 70s was like. The sets, costumes, props, and everything else in the production design (led by Production Designer Martin Whist) gave the film that historic feel that I just love in the movies. There's something about going to the movies and escaping into a different time, whether in the past or the future, that always works for me. And when its done well, I really appreciate it.<br /><br />Director of Photography Larry Fong, known for his work on 300 (2006) and the TV show Lost, provides some stunning cinematography that literal had me gasping for air in awe. While I'm not a HUGE fan of Abrams' now signature lens flare look that he started with his remake of Star Trek (2009), it works up until I started noticing it too much...same as in Star Trek. I'm hoping that Abrams' learns that less is more sometimes, and lens flares can be great when used in the right places to support the story, but can be annoying when they BECOME the story. While I didn't overly notice the music by composer Michael Giacchino, I also didn't feel like any music was missing at crucial points during the movie. I would definitely like to listen to the Super 8 score again and focus on it because I think there were some good pieces of music throughout the movie. The sound design and sound editing was outstanding on Super 8. The dialogue was dead on and all of the explosions, gunfire, and other special events that I expected to feel from the sound of the movie worked well.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Super 8 is the summer blockbuster to go see in my humble opinion so far this year. While I haven't yet seen any of the many superhero or comic book movies that have filled the screens the last two months, I do know that I really enjoyed Super 8 on the big screen. It's the kind of popcorn movie that I grew up loving and looking forward to. I love going to the theater for a clever, original film like this one. Super 8 starts as an outstanding film (4.5 stars) but ends as just a good film (3 stars). So I've given it an initial rating of 3.5 stars. It's one of those movies I wanna watch again at home on blu-ray to see if it gets better the next time. It may just be a 4 star film for me eventually, but for now it's at least locked in as one of the best movies of 2011, likely to find a place on my Top 10 at year's end.

review/summary: Excellent for Curing Insomnia
review/text: I have to begin by confessing that Spielberg movies, with the exception of Empire of the Sun, have always bored me. If ever a director typified the standard lazy Hollywood churn-out-the-schlock mentality it's Spielberg. This movie - which I was asked to watch by a friend who likes sci-fi - actually hits a low spot because pretty much every aspect is flat. The camera work is tiresome and unimaginative, the script could have been written by a write-a-cliche computer program, the acting is one-dimensional, there is no plot, and the special effects are frankly unintentionally funny but always boring and telegraphed hours in advance. Likewise the soundtrack is... well, let's just say, this movie definitely would be better with the volume set to zero.<br /><br />In addition to being a tiresome hack job in which everyone dials in their contribution from long-distance, it's a sci-fi movie with no science and no fiction. There's basically not much of a plot ("hey, what if there's this weird stranded alien and like, the military capture it and torture it, and, like, you know, it escapes and starts killing people...") and the fact the "monster" is  putatively an alien is irrelevant - it could just as easily be a giant poltergeist or a land-capable shark.<br /><br />As always, Spielberg throws in tons of faux sentimentality (young teens rediscovering the importance of fathers... sigh....) and close-up shots than serve only to reveal that no one in this flaccid production can act.<br /><br />But all is not lost. If you are one of the many people out there who have difficulty falling asleep at the end of a stressful day, this is definitely the movie for you. It is so dreadful, so tedious, such an absolute waste of time and money that you'll be sound asleep within twenty minutes of the opening sequence. And for that contribution to somnolence everywhere this movie deserves the one star rating I've given it.

review/summary: It's All About The Storytelling
review/text: [*no spoilers*]<br /><br />If you're after a non-stop thriller, packed with massacre and destruction and alien culture, this is not your movie. Super 8 tells a different story from the one suggested in its heart-pounding trailer, in that it DOES tell a story. And if you're fortunate enough to have been exposed to Spielberg before, you know any story in which he takes part is not one you want to miss.<br /><br />Super 8 is about relationships and the power and ramifications of feeling, which the supernatural element serves to amplify and test. We are tipped off to these film centerpieces in the opening scene, when thirteen-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) and his father (Kyle Chandler) are suffering through a personal tragedy, and his father's misgivings about someone in town are presented. We care already, especially with Courtney's earnest and expressive eyes that evoke empathy with every emotion he conveys. He is a promising actor whose future I look forward to seeing develop.<br /><br />Don't think this film is entirely dramatic and weighty, however--the comic relief is surprising in its placement and frequency alike. It roots us in the un-jaded juvenile mind and emphasizes the grand proportions (which really pop on the big screen) of what is unfolding around the group of boys we follow and attach ourselves to.<br /><br />Carrying us along on their adventure is a solid script and thoughtful detail placement. As Jamie Graham of Total Film puts it, "Like Spielberg, [director J.J.] Abrams has an eye for awe." Think back on the landscape you caught a glimpse of through the hole in the bedroom wall, once you've watched the film, and you'll see what he means. Or, in retrospect, mull over the defense Joe's father presents to his son, the irony in his declaration that as the town deputy, with the sheriff not present, everyone is relying on him. There used to be someone else, but now there's only him. (For now you'll have to take my word for it...)<br /><br />The score, reminiscent of something from John William's legacy (hats off to Michael Giacchino)...the transportation back to 1979...the young male camaraderie and adventure...the nods to Spielberg's classic results from dabbling in the otherworldly...the focus on the characters and storytelling...all of these elements make for an experience you don't want to miss. You are, at the same time, given a dose of nostalgia and a new classic to cherish. Brilliant.

review/text: I go to the movies to escape reality and have fun...as a cop who has enough excitment and stress it's nice to imagine I am a kid again. Thanks for the ride JJ Abrams I will definately be buying the blu-ray to enjoy with friends and family. I will be turning up the bass and volume and watching as they jump out of there seats. This movie will hopefully live the life of "classic" terrific kids movies as goonies, sandlot, ET amongst plenty other really great movies. I brought my girlfriend, two people both kids at heart but in reality are middle aged.  We walked out of the theater feeling we had just went to Disneyworld or just left after watching Star wars for the first time. We went to dinner grinning from ear to ear, saying that it made us feel like kids again. I know movies like this are not for everyone but for those who have kids inside themselves which are allowed to let their imagination run away for the brief movie time.  There is so much to enjoy about this movie. I wish I was 10 again then my feelings would be age appropriate. I find that sooo many people over analyze stuff today who really need to relax.  This movie is and will be a keeper which will be fun to watch over and over just to see folks jump at certain parts of a really good kids movie! Thanks for reading and to all the negative haters...one word...CHILL!!!

review/summary: Abrams is "Super"
review/text: J.J. Abrams has not made a lot of films, but each film has been very good, embracing the genre and giving fans something to celebrate. Even "Mission Impossible III", derided because of Cruise's shenanigans, was very good, better than the first two installments. But each film has been a stepping stone. Considering the quality of these films, the possibility of a filmmaker of Abrams' skill and caliber working on a personal project has been tantalizing.<br /><br />Now, with "Super 8", Abrams makes a film based on his own idea. He blends all of his superlative filmmaking skills with a personal story and the effort is almost magical. "Super 8" is by far the best film I have seen this year. And it will take a lot for a new film to take this position away. It just may end up as the best film of the year.<br /><br />Set in small town Ohio, in 1979, a group of kids gets together to make a film using their super 8 cameras. Originally a zombie film, the director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), a pudgy kid from a large, noisy family, decides his magnum opus needs more drama, so he enlists the help of Alice (Elle Fanning), who his friend and cameraman, Joe (Joel Courtney) has a crush on. The whole group sneaks out at midnight and heads to the local train station. As a train approaches, Charles shouts for the crew to get ready, he wants to capture the "production value" of the train speeding by. But a truck soon appears and begins driving directly for the locomotive. The kids watch in horror as the truck crashes into the train and the whole thing derails. They run for their lives, trying to escape the carnage. As the dust begins to clear, they realize there have been no injuries amongst them and run off just as ominous government agencies begin to arrive to do the clean-up. Charles and Joel also find the camera. It is broken, but they decide to develop the film anyway. Over the next few days, Joel's dad, Jackson, the Sheriff (Kyle Chandler) begins to realize something strange is going on; dogs begin to disappear, then his boss is missing, then the government steps in and gives him a story about the train wreck. Jackson confronts Nelec (Noah Emmerich), the leader of the army's 'clean-up' efforts. Just as the rumors begin to fly, and stories of mysterious sightings begin to circulate, the town is evacuated because of a wild fire. Joel and his friends try to escape to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />From the moment "Super 8" begins, you know you are in for something special. Abrams sets the film in 1979 which also seems to be a homage to the sort of film his mentor, and producer of the film, Steven Spielberg made during the same period. Everything about the film seems authentic and real. People are wearing new Walkmans. The clothes and cars are all period specific. The attitudes are even a little more innocent. Even better, when Abrams decides to feature some new-fangled item, like the Walkman, for instance, it becomes a part of the story. This takes the moment from being a simple wink-wink nudge-nudge type of thing and shows how clever Abrams really is. It is very easy to make a visual reference like this. It is much more difficult to make it a believable part of the story. Abrams always does the more difficult and makes it work.<br /><br />Charles is part of a large, noisy family who seems to be bursting out of the walls of their house. Yet, there is always room for Joe at the table. Joe and Charles are best friends and this helps to make the film seem even a little more nostalgic. In fact, there seem to be more similarities in this film to Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" than to the oft-mentioned "E.T.". Charles large family and their crowded dinner table are similar to the Neary family's. At one point, an electrician is fixing a power line. He stands in the bucket on his truck and rises toward the junction box. Roy Neary was also an electrician who is trying to fix massive power outages. "Close Encounters" is set in Indiana, "Super 8" in Ohio, Both feature people from small town America dealing with something they could never have imagined.<br /><br />The real key to the success of "Super 8" is the kids. Everyone of them gives a good performance and really raises the bar for future child actors. Joel Courtney plays Joe, the son of the local Sheriff. A family tragedy puts a strain on the relationship between the two and Joe escapes the pressures of his everyday life with his large group of friends. Courtney is just so natural, so at ease, he never seems like he is acting. He deals with his grief, with his dad, with the drama in his town like anyone his age would. They escape into the making of their film. Joe is also extremely nervous when Charles announces he has asked Alice to act in the film because he has a huge crush on Alice and becomes a bit tongue-tied. Joe becomes the hero of the film, fighting every inch of the way to find out what is going on and then fighting to end the problem. It is a very good, richly observed performance. More amazing, this is Joel Courtney's first film.<br /><br />Riley Griffiths plays Charles, the director of the film the kids are working on. It is difficult to tell for sure, but I will bet that this character is closely modeled after Abrams when he was a kid. Charles is a funny guy; his face always buried in a movie magazine, thinking of new scenes, new ideas to make their film that much better. He has clearly read everything he could possibly get his hands on and relishes every bit of it, even the stuff he doesn't completely understand. At the train station, he walks around framing the picture with his hands; he seems obsessed with capturing 'production values', like the real train passing. When they retrieve the camera after the wreck, they take the film to the local photo shop and send it away to be processed. His performance is funny, but not overly jokey; he is just a normal kid who loves everything about filmmaking. More amazing, this is Riley Griffith's first film as well.<br /><br />Elle Fanning, the veteran of the group, is very good. Alice seems intrigued to be involved in the film, but she is also asked to help provide the transportation for the group, which puts her on edge when the Sheriff's son shows up. She doesn't have a driver's license and is afraid of getting into trouble. But Joe quickly puts her at ease. When they arrive at the train station, they are all amazed by her acting ability. Throughout the course of the film, she and Joe spend a lot of time together and become closer and their relationship provides many sweet innocent moments to the film.<br /><br />The rest of the kids are all great. Each is different, fun and unique.<br /><br />Kyle Chandler does a great job as Jackson, the man who is a Sheriff first and a dad to Joe second. He quickly realizes something is going on and becomes even more determined to figure things out when he meets Nelec and realizes they aren't telling him the whole truth. His town is experiencing something big, and it consumes him, so it takes him a while to realize his son is getting into mischief. But when he does, he quickly puts a stop to it. Then he becomes busy again, leaving Joe to his own devices. The relationship between the two is not good, and hasn't been good for a long time. Then, the family tragedy only pulls them further apart. Chandler does a very good job of showing us all of the different responsibilities Jackson is dealing with.<br /><br />Toby Emmerich adds another shady government/ villain-type role to his resume. The role is good, believable and suitable for the story. But the character actor has played this role before, many times.<br /><br />Ron Eldard plays Louis, Alice's no-good dad. Louis is haunted by many demons and adds complexity to the film.<br /><br />The real beauty of "Super 8" is that Abrams is simply a great filmmaker. He seems determined to make films in which he reveals as little as possible about the creature/ monster/ alien/ threat to the main characters as possible. In "Cloverfield", a film he helped write and produce, the threat is viewed in brief snippets, often in grainy cell phone or camcorder footage. For the majority of the film, you never see it fully. This does two things. It makes the menace more believable and it creates more suspense. Because we can't see the whole thing, we are less likely to find fault in it, or to disbelieve in the existence of it. Also, because the threat is revealed in small, fleeting moments, we are never sure when it will show up. I know some people don't like this film, but the cinema verite style, the unknown cast and the snippets of footage of the creature all served to create a memorable monster film.<br /><br />Abrams continues this same sort of idea in "Super 8". The threat to this small town is not revealed for a long time. But to maintain suspense, we see bits of what it can cause. Joe watches through small, high windows as things fly into the air. The electrician watches things happening in a maintenance building in the distance. Even when we are placed close to the action, Abrams uses some fairly brilliant methods to hide the identity of the threat.<br /><br />When everything starts to fall into place and we realize what is going on, it all makes sense and we are committed to the ride because we have spent so much time in this universe, with these characters.<br /><br />It is also unusual (unfortunately) for a summer film to capture any emotion, let alone anything that could seem real and move us. In "Super 8", Abrams sets up the story with a sad event, which helps to inform us of the relationship between Joe and Jackson. And throughout the story, we see how strained their life together is, how difficult. And this all leads to a very emotional moment, which I confess, made me tear up.<br /><br />Ultimately, "Super 8" has moments that are funny, scary, suspenseful, exciting, dramatic and more. It has everything. Better yet, everything seems necessary to the characters and the story.<br /><br />A couple of weeks before the film was released, I watched the trailer for "Super 8" before another highly anticipated summer film. After the trailer, someone mumbled "E.T., phone home" causing some laughter. But this remark is more of a compliment than a dig. Abrams has captured the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder Elliot and his brother and sister experience in "E.T." And because of this, he captures the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder for us to relive.<br /><br />If it sounds like I am gushing, I am. Go see this movie. Go. Go already.

review/text: "Super 8" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the summer of 1979, a group of friends in a small Ohio town witness a catastrophic train crash while making a super 8 movie and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy tries to uncover the truth - something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.<br /><br />The cast led by Kyle Chandler (as Jackson Lamb) & Elle Fanning (as Alice Dainard) is excellent. The story, screenplay & directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Larry Fong is excellent. The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey is excellent. The casting by Alyssa Weisberg & April Webster is excellent. The production design by Martin Whist is excellent. The art direction by David Scott & Domenic Silvestri is excellent. The set decoration by Fainche MacCarthy is excellent. The costume design by Ha Nguyen is excellent. The visual effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are brilliant. The creature design by Neville Page is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that superbly harkens back to Steven Spielberg classics, like "E.T" & "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind", ironically, Spielberg produced this film. This is a well-crafted original story that keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat while your heart races at a faster rate. This is J.J. Abrams' best film of his career, so far. This is also the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far.

review/summary: How did two great directors create such a lame movie?
review/text: I have to say I had high hopes for Super 8.  Needless to say those hopes have been dashed. This was a flimsy excuse for a film which could have done with some more plot and character development and less of a cliche.  The ending was lame and was so contrived a placard could have spelled it out. The thing that I really hated was that up until the last few minutes the movie was actually quite well done.<br /><br />The problem seems that no one could decide if the monster was good or bad and if should fear or hate it. It leaves us with so many unanswered questions and just wimps out.  All in all this is a very poor movie and is not worth your time.  I am glad I didn't waste my money when it was in the movies.

review/text: I'm not sure why this movie received such amazing reviews.  The story was okay, but the pacing and acting made it difficult to watch.  My husband fell asleep about 30 minutes into it, and he wasn't even tired.  I'm not sure what the price is now, but I would recommend waiting until it hits $.99 or free before I would recommend renting it.  Then again, I often suggest that everyone watch the blockbusters, if for no other reason than to improve future Trivial Pursuit games.

review/summary: "Super 8" is a new, modern masterpiece.  A bluray review.
review/text: I grew up on the films of Steven Spielberg.  He made me fall in love with the movies and led me to how magical they can be.  Some films are about dark, gritty subject matter, some show us beautiful sunsets, some terrify us...Spielberg sought to take the magical way a child views the world and make it real, and in essence, reminded us as adults, that a little of that magic still lives inside of us.  We still long for that sense of awe and wonder.  Sci-fi (a genre I never have considered myself a fan of) at its best, should inspire an a sense of awe, wonder, and moreover, ...possibility.  "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" took us on a journey like that through the eyes of an ordinary man.  "E.T." took us on the same path but through the eyes of a child trying to cope with the pain of his parents' divorce.  It is this very innocent and beautiful glance inward that gives rise to the masterpiece called "Super 8".  A summer movie that reminded me how good summer movies used to be before they were taken over by comic book heroes and sequels.<br /><br />"Super 8", written and directed by JJ Abrams (MI: III, Star Trek, TV's Lost), is the best summer movie I have seen in at least 2 decades.  It is inspired by Spielberg's ouevre, ad it certainly makes sese that Spielberg produced this as well.  Set in the mid-1970s, Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends who set out to make a zombie movie with a Super 8mm camera.  The kids are around 1-14years old, and the pack is led by Joe Lamb (played beautifully by Joel Courtney).  Joe is a smart, senitive and creative kid who recently lost his mother is an accident.  Courtney is an actor to watch especially watching how deftly he imbues Joe with a fresh-faced sensitivity and wisdom beyond his years withou ever once becoming cloying.  Much the same can be said if the other young actors who fill out his group of friends, among them is Alice (played by Elle Fanning of "The Door in the Floor"), who is a potential love interest for Joe.  One night while filming their zombie flick, a train derails, nearly killing the lot of them.  This sequence makes up the most exciting and spectacular action scenes and bit of special effects of last summer.  It make the train wreck in "The Fugitive" look like amateur hour.  It's a sequence that perfectly mixes action, terror, special effects, and performance.  The rest of the film deals with what's in the train and how it affects the town and the characters.  None of which I would dare spoil.<br /><br />"Super 8" flooded me with such nostalgia...not just of summer movies past, but of American boyhood, endess summers, and the promise of adventure.  Joe and his friends are at the age where they stand on the precipice of believing in magic and leaving it behind for adulthood. The movie is exciting, often very scary, and very moving.  The adult cast is nicely filled out by "Friday Nigh Lights" Kyle Chandler as Joe's dad and the town Sherriff, Noah Emmerich (The Walking Dead) as a mysterious military heavy, and Ron Eldard (Deep Impact) as Alice's troubled, alcoholic,and very sad dad.<br /><br />Director JJ Abrams has made a superior thriller that gives us everything we want in our summer movies.  Action, excitement, lots of humor, brilliant special effects by Industrial Light & Magic, but most of all heart and soul.  Abrams has shown himself as an auteur and not just a brilliant action meastro. In a summer over-stuffed with superhero films with bloated $200 budgets, Abrams made his spectacular tale for a relatively thrifty $50 million.  This goes to show that hundreds of millions does not buy a story a heart.  Only an artist cando wht Abrams has done here.  Super * is Oscar-worthy and the best picture of the year.<br /><br />"Super 8" is presented on Blu-ray in a dazzling and flawless MPEG 4 AVC codec.  The PQ is immaculate.  I could not find a single flaw.  Colors are bright and robust, contrast is spot on and edgs are razor sharp.  All of tis is achieved without any digital tampering such as DNR or edge enhancement.  Fine detail is crystalline in presentation.  Textures are fully realized.  The image looks more like a window we could put our hand into rather than flat 2D.  Also worth mentioning, Abrams refused to film in 3D as he feels the market is over-saturated with this gimmick.  He's right and good for him.<br /><br />The audio is a show-stopper with the first of its kind I have heard at a Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  TrueHD is my favorite audio as it sounds the most realistic.  Surrounds are the most enveloping and chillingly real I have ever hard.  The train derailment is a jaw-drpper.  I felt like I was in the middle of it.  My partner and watchd this sequence 3 times in a row.  It is a sequences which should be playing in all big box stores a it will sell HDTVs and Bluray players in record numbers.  This is why I love this technology.  This is the best audio track I have ever heard.  Completed with crisp, perfect dialogue reproduction...this is the track to top going forward.  This disc is the epitome of reference grade, demo material.<br /><br />The special features are splendid with terrific cast and filmmaker commentaries, awesome featurettes, among others.  Te packasge includes the BD, a SD DVD and digital copy.  Currently as I write this, "Super 8" is selling for $19.99.  Buy it now.  Don't bother rentin it.  It also makes a great gift for anyone who loves film...and wants to remmber what summer used to feel like.<br /><br />Rating: A+

The finale goes rather unexplained, as well, when the typical space monster somehow manages to morph a bunch of earthly metal junk into a space ship in a matter of seconds. Say what? Prior to those letdowns, this modern-day Speilberg production features his usual band of cute kids getting into trouble, but avoiding anything really bad happening to them because of their wide-eyed innocence. If you enjoy that formula, you will like this otherwise high quality production. Just don't expect any logic.

review/summary: What the Summer Blockbuster Should Aspire to Be
review/text: Super 8 began last year with a marketing campaign that provided a general idea of what to expect from the film while revealing nothing. As the trailers became only slightly more revealing, the comparisons to Spielberg began. It's no secret that Steven Spielberg produced the film, so this comparison may seem easy but it is an inarguable fact that this film would not exist without his influence. Super 8 is the offspring of films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies but it never feels like a derivative cash-in and actually succeeds in taking moviegoers back to a time when the "summer blockbuster" meant something; a time when a good story went hand-in-hand with special effects and action sequences. There are two types of movies here and writer/director J.J. Abrams does a refreshing job balancing them both rather than letting the action overtake the story. Its adolescent characters, military villains, and late 70s, small town setting evoke memories of Spielberg but writer/director J.J. Abrams brings enough originality to the project that it's less of a rehash than a renaissance.<br /><br />The film takes place in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio in 1979. 13-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney in an impressive debut) is helping his group of friends make a Super 8 movie at an old train depot. To the group's enjoyment, the "director" Charles (Riley Griffiths) has convinced local girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to drive them to the depot and appear in the movie. As they're shooting, a train appears in the distance and, in moments, is derailed by a pickup truck....And, for the purpose of preserving the surprise element; I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Is the "secret" at the heart of the film really a secret anymore? Most people have enough information to deduce what's going on, but the less you know the better. It's all part of the effect Super 8 has. There are plenty of special effects and action sequences, but Abrams allows his film to build nicely before revealing what he has in store. Unlike most recent summer blockbusters, the action is never brainless; it serves a purpose and functions for the story as opposed to an excuse to show the advancements in technology. The first big special effects sequence is the train crash, which is one of the most intense, exciting sequences you're likely to come across this year. You may question the physics behind it, but you can't deny the heart-racing excitement it inspires nor can you deny the stunning special effects that made it possible.<br /><br />Super 8 really succeeds where most summer movies fail by delivering strong writing, with a good story and well-developed characters in addition to all the action. While Abrams may go for easy emotional cues his story has a lot of heart and Super 8 succeeds extensively on its likable, well-defined characters and human story. The story never feels like a backdrop for the action, a practice Hollywood has inexplicably embraced recently. Abrams obviously has an eye for casting as well. The adolescent actors in the lead roles are a talented, funny, and emotive group that convincingly embody their characters and never seem amateurish or annoying. The adult actors do fine jobs too, but the adults aren't as well-defined as the children are. Joe's dad, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the anguished, withdrawn father who steps in when things get messy while Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is the typical stone-faced military villain. This is a minor flaw that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Finally, it captures the 1979, small-town vibe wonderfully adding a very "classic feel" and is a great looking film in general; moody, nostalgic, and, yes, "Spielbergian."<br /><br />Super 8 does not disappoint on any level and is what a summer blockbuster should aspire to be. It is consistently entertaining, riveting from start to finish, and a wonderful reminder of the magic that's been missing from the movies. While it may be too soon to make such a bold statement, Super 8 seems destined to become a classic of its genre. J.J. Abrams is forging quite the career. It is impressive enough that he has made a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film for a remarkably low $45 million at a time when the box office is overrun with movies with triple-digit budgets and double-digit IQs. Even more impressive is that he has fashioned a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film that is one of the best films of this year.<br /><br />GRADE: A

review/summary: Train wreck of a movie
review/text: Often, a movie requires the audience to exercise a degree of willing suspension of disbelief. "Independence Day" had some examples, but they were overcome by the sheer fun of the story and the fact that they weren't totally in your face about it.  But this . . .<br /><br />First of all, the movie was shot so dark that there are multiple times that it's impossible to know what's going on.  Perhaps J.J. thinks it's cool to leave almost entire scenes to the imagination, but there is nothing new about telling a story with audio only. Just ask your grandparents about radio shows.<br /><br />The acting is mostly believable, but the actions of the characters are not. When the acting becomes lost in unlikely actions, I cease to care.  For example:<br /><br />The train has wrecked. Military personnel are almost immediately on the scene.  Obviously this train is very important to the government. The kids are warned by the doctor that they and their families will be killed by the government if they are discovered to know anything about what has happened.  The kids, terrified, flee the scene and all agree to never speak of it again.<br /><br />So what do they do shortly afterward? They return to the train wreck to film it. From an open area on a nearby hill. In full sight.  The area is swarming with soldiers, vehicles, and helicopters, searching everything in the area. Except, of course, the group of young people on the hill right in front of them who are filming everything.  Somehow, this doesn't seem to interest anyone, nor are the kids seemingly worried at all anymore about their lives or the lives of their families.<br /><br />Not much later, they film the soldiers emptying a house of it's contents. This time they are doing the filming within a few feet of where the soldiers are working.  And nobody says anything.  Eventually the C.O. asks an aide what they kids are doing, only to have the matter forgotten when the Sheriff takes one of the kids - and the camera - with him.<br /><br />I am amazed that so many people could like this movie after such an insult to their intelligence.  Overlooking plot holes is sometimes needed, I understand that.  But this was so monumentally stupid, so glaringly obvious, that it ruined the movie. Nor was that the end of it.  This was just the first in a series of grinding, merciless non sequiturs that soon leave the mind numbed in detached boredom, waiting for the insult to end.  I give it two stars only for the fun 1970's references and the lack, for once, of endless CGI action scenes.

review/summary: Did We See The Same Movie
review/text: Five of us, of various ages, watched this move together.  We all had five thumbs down.  After reading some of the glowing rewiews here on Amazon, I do wonder if they mean anything or are written by the production marketing detartment.  This movie was quite lame; poorly written and the acting was uneven.  We gave up counting the gaps in the plot, such as it was.  Here we have a massive train wreck; yet the colonel walks right up and picks up the film wrapper.<br />I could go on, but why . . .

review/summary: WOW!!! what a great movie!
review/text: Well, now that I've seen it I've absolutely love it, the effects of the main scene were of course CGI, which made it incredibly realistic. Well, J.J. Abrams + Speilberg, E.T., GO HOME! The setting of 1979 Ohio was really authentic with the music, cars, clothes, cameras and more. I have to say that my favorite scene was when Joey, Alice, Charles, and the gang went to a train station and their former science teacher at their middle school drives his truck on to the train tracks and causes a HUGE train crash! That was honestly one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen. Now during the huge crash an alien is let loose in their town. After they get the film strip, Charles and Joey see alien claws behind the train car. I really don't want to give the ending away, so I'm going to let you buy the movie :P But it's definitely, if it could get a letter grade, I would give it an A++++++

review/text: I really really love this movie - is a rare mixture of innocence, emotion, and fantasy. I had forgotten how good it was until I just recently rewatched it. For a few brief hours I was transported back to the awkwardness of my youth, with that nerdy Dungeon & Dragons-infused belief that anything was possible. A nice escape.

review/summary: Ups and Downs
review/text: All in all a little dissapointed in this movie.  I read plenty of good reviews about it and I picked it up at a local store for 8 bucks.  I felt the story line drug out too long then all of a sudden at the end when it started to get good it was over.  there were a lot of good parts but also a lot of slow, boring parts.<br /><br />the video and audio on the blu ray were great especially the audio in the train wreck seen.  if you have a good speaker setup with a sub it is awesome!<br /><br />for 8 bucks i'm not too upset i just expected a better flick...

review/summary: Abrams and Spielberg made a great summer blockbuster!
review/text: It's one of the best summer film in years! It's slick, cool, and a little scary. The only backfire of "Super 8" is the language. It should've been rated R for pervasive language, but what's worse is that the KIDS say it. It's just not right; it's like playing with Playdo! Be cautious parents, but over that, Abrams and Spielberg make a great team making a film that makes everyone connected to the film.

review/summary: I wanted to love this movie, and I almost did.
review/text: Imagine watching E.T. for the whole movie and seeing E.T. a couple times. That's Super 8 for you. You wait the whole movie to see this alien and finally toward the end you finally get to see it. By the way, it's overkill in the CGI department when it comes to this particular alien. It puts the alien from the movie Aliens to shame. It was a lot of build up for so very little pay off.<br /><br />On the other hand, Spielberg doesn't fail in the adventure department. This movie had a bit of a Goonies meets E.T. feel to it. The kid actors did an awesome job. The cinematography was great and the plot was pretty good. I think they just majorly drop the ball when it came time to construct a good alien and execution plan.<br /><br />Again I went into this movie already loving it, but when the credits went up I felt robbed of a great experience. It had so many great trademarks that made me a Spielberg fan. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars, but to be honest that's being pretty generous.

review/text: I think the hype before the movie set my expectations higher than they should have been. This movie is Speilburg's version renewed of E.T. and a less threatening isolated version of alien invasion from a military controlled Area 51 escape. The child imagination will enjoy this one but the adult imagination will stop believing the events are possible by the end of the movie.

review/summary: Sweet Story, Well Told
review/text: This movie is just that good, old-fashioned storytelling that Spielberg does so well. It is a good, rainy day movie that you can enjoy with your children. It would be mildly scary for younger children, but for older children, mostly suspenseful rather than actually scary.  Dreamworks should have put more money into promoting this movie.  It's not strong on special effects, but it is a story about a teenage adventure rather than a sci-fi spectacle.

review/summary: A great film let down by a poor ending
review/text: What's it about?<br /><br />A group of young kids making a zombie film witness a horrific train crash, and capture on their Super 8 camera much more than they anticipated.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Having been produced by Steven Spielberg, you definitely get the 80's ET & Goonies-esq vibe of the film, but with a darker tone to it. The characters of the film and their interactions in the community are actually the most interesting part of the film. It is only when the `mystery' of the film takes on a science fiction twist that it removes you from the reality of the film it has expertly built up, therefore causing your concentration to waver slightly. So by the end, you are left debating if what you watched was just a good film, or an amazing film?<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Prepare yourself for the train crash; it'll blow your speakers apart!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The famous bicycle from Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. can be seen as a part of metal junk that is being attached to the water tower in one of the final scenes.

review/text: My son and I saw this movie when it was in the theatre and we both loved the movie. This blu-ray was my wife and my mother's first chance to see the movie and they loved it too. However these Digital Copy offers are getting ridiculous. We like to buy the Blu-ray & DVD plus Digital Copy sets because I typically have a backup on the desktop and download a copy for itunes for travel. I thought finally had figured out this system with downloading the Windows Media copy first then loading the iTunes copy using the code provided. These Paramount disks are a pain only allowing one copy of the didgital copy to be loaded so I am glad I accidentally loaded the iTunes copy first because I was only given the one download and the Windows Media copy didn't work.

review/summary: Fun Movie but just missed the mark of being a timeless movie
review/text: I was a little wary about ordering Super 8 from some of the reviews.  I really did enjoy the movie plus I am a sucker for a happy ending. I thought they had come to my street and neighborhood to film the movie. A reviewer had compared Super 8 to The Goonies - not even close. I did not think they let all of the kids personality's come to light mainly just the 3 main characters. I feel the story line was weak, real weak. The train wreck looked like models. The Professor, the Evil Air Force guy and the Alien did not have any character development. I could not hate the Evil Air Force guy or feel sorry for the Alien or the Professor. The makers of this movie missed something to make this a truly good movie that I would want to watch year after year. I still watch the Goonies from time to time and I am old. Don't stop watching the movie when the credits begin that is when they show the finished movie the kids were making. The biggest laugh for me was the almost the last line of the kid's movie where the director is speaking hoping it would be a Cleveland International Film Festival nominee. I think I liked it more than the movie Super 8 and it would be more likely of winning an award than Super 8.

review/summary: Great Movie.  Classic Spielberg.
review/text: This is classic Steven Spielberg in action.  Although he didn't direct it, he may as well have.  He did produce it and it shows.  It's got the essence of early 80's films like "Goonies", "Batteries Not Included" and "E.T."  There is a spectacular action sequence involving a train and a bunch of kids who seem to be on to the fact that there is a lot more going on in the town they're living in than any of the adults are aware of.  A group of kids set out to shoot a little horror film so that they can submit it to a Film Festival, but they end up capturing more than they bargained for setting them up on a fast paced thrill ride that turns their town upside down.  Some intense moments that may be too much for young kids, but for the rest of the family this is a joy.

review/summary: Fun Film!
review/text: It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.<br /><br />Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.<br /><br />My Impressions:<br /><br />The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on!<br /><br />We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.<br /><br />The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted "production value" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.<br /><br />The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes:<br /><br />Father's Faith:<br /><br />Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother "should have" taken her father.<br /><br />The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.<br /><br />Amateur Horror Film:<br /><br />During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch!<br />I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br /><br />Music!<br /><br />The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.<br /><br />Hackneyed Themes:<br /><br />Yes there were some "I've seen this before" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.<br /><br />But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.<br /><br />Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Director:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Producer:<br />Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Writer:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Stars:<br />Elle Fanning, Amanda Michalka and Kyle Chandler

review/summary: A Cute Spielberg Film By A More Modern Writer/Director
review/text: Ah yes, the 70s and 80s days of cutesy Spielberg sensibilities. Basically that's what you get here with J.J. Abrams latest installment. And why not? Steven gave his blessings and executive produced as well. But somehow I think Steven did much more than just produce. The films feels so Stevenish you'd think he held Abrams hand all through the production. You get the usual dose of Spielbergisms with the cute early adolescent kids who act twice as mature and smart as REAL kids of that age.<br /><br />The film focuses on a group of kids in 1979 making a Super 8 zombie film (obviously inspired not by Steven but George Romero) and then get caught up in a government conspiracy involving a benign but very pissed-off extraterrestrial that the military has held prisoner for over 20 years. The kids witness the train wreck that causes it's escape and their peaceful little Ohio town experiences all sorts of mayhem.<br /><br />Aside from the typical monster-on-the-loose plot, the film does have some good character developement. The characters, both adults and teens, are well drawn out. Touching on issues such as loss of family members, alienation with parents, a little puberty thrown in and you have all the makings of a warm and fuzzy drama Spielberg style. The only problem is as said before, these kids act just too mature for their age. When I was this age in the 70s, me and everybody else were just plain stupid. And we certainly didn't open ourselves up to each other like they do here.<br /><br />All in all, the film is entertaining escapism for the summer season. While not a classic measuring up to the likes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or E.T., I think J.J. can chalk up another winner with this one. After all, he got help from the master of the cutes himself.

review/summary: For The Kids In Us All
review/text: Occasionally, I get challenged by someone about a review that involves a children's movie - as if there were some magical demarkation between that and crap. There isn't. If you can't see that simple fact, then you have my sympathy for having blunt perceptions and an apologist mentality.<br /><br />A good film is a good film - period. There isn't a golf handicap for movies; a special pass for marginal, ineffective or failure.<br /><br />There are numerous fantastic productions that are specifically geared toward children that are simultaneously amazing films. Think about it for a second.<br /><br />'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KQVDH8">The Goonies</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZCLH5S">Explorers</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEFK">Ratatouille</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055B7IPE">Up</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P4O">The Adventures of Tintin</a>', and the list goes on and on and on. And consider budget conscious or sublime productions which sacrifice nothing when it comes to quality storytelling: '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K00NN0">The Sandlot</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJS">Hope and Glory</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Z361M">The Red Balloon</a>', etc.<br /><br />Again, funding isn't the issue. Quality in filmmaking is the key discussion every...single...time.<br /><br />So this question/challenge isn't about my adult perceptions. It's whether or not a film is a winner, middling, or just bites. It's not a fault for pointing out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I5628">The Emperor Has No Clothes</a>. Why attack the messenger?<br /><br />This amazing and completely engaging film is a perfect example of quality with no discounts for being geared toward younger audiences. Just a flat out enjoyable, fully constructed, and deftly performed production that just happens to be a kid's flick. In the vein of 'E.T.', a movie whose magic of storytelling, childhood adventure and personal sacrifice will hopefully embed itself deep into the hearts of youths everywhere. A hopeful prediction: Thirty years from now and all those new middle-agers will fondly reminisce about Super 8 and how it affected their lives, changed it even. Very much like Star Wars did for many of my generation. Well, a hope anyway.<br /><br />The story opens with a gang of misfit teens and the tragic circumstances that begins a summer that no one will ever forget.<br /><br />It's 1979 and the small town of Lillian, Ohio is about to undergo an unimaginable trauma. Joseph Lamb is one of a quirky group of kids whose big dream is to win an amateur movie contest. But their innocent days end suddenly with the death of Joe's mother at the steel foundry. Now an only child, along with his devastated deputy sheriff father, they struggle to go on without the heart of their lives.<br /><br />Still, as kids will do, they try to forget. Not with malice, but because we all know that children are children for a reason. For them, life goes on. And Joe finds comfort helping his friends with the film project. So it comes as a double shock when he learns that his buddy, the conspicuously boisterous director, has finally found a girl to play the co-starring role in their zombie flick. Shocking not only because he found a girl, by itself a noteworthy miracle, but because of who she is, or rather, who her father is in relation to Joe himself. He's the man indirectly responsible for his mother's death.<br /><br />But Joe is insightful enough to understand that Alice wasn't at fault and smartly holds no ill feelings. That she's also the most beautiful girl in school also softens the surprise. So, newly installed as the lone female to the troupe of goofy buds, the gang rolls on, both literally and figuratively as the film becomes their summer adventure. Guerrilla moviemaking, using standing sets without permission, is pretty common for young directors and the gang is no different, taking advantage when and where they can - including an opportunity to film one night at the rail station. But it will be a night like no other.<br /><br />Collectively, they nearly all get killed in the process of accidentally capturing the spectacular train crash near the town limits. Having been so close to the explosive wreck, they're amazed to be alive. They're even more stunned to realize that someone intentionally crashed the millions of pounds of rolling steel stock. Bizarrely - it's someone they know - their school science teacher. And he's still alive.<br /><br />Soon the local authorities like Joe's dad are quickly supplanted by the military, and US Air Force personnel carrying assault weapons and various strange gear appear on the scene.<br /><br />Something is terribly wrong.<br /><br />Things quickly spiral as more and more odd events start to occur. All their dogs go missing. The power grid fluctuates with no explanation. Miles of transmission lines and microwave ovens disappear; even entire car engines are torn out of the bodies of vehicles. Worse yet, there are reports of people who have just vanished. As the town begins to realize these events can't be easily explained away - panic sets in.<br /><br />Yikes.<br /><br />An incredible film - period.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- When anyone challenges me to explain great acting - this is now the film I reference. The train sequence, as young Ellie Fanning switches 'on' her character. That is *exactly* what it means to be an actor.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- This was a reward for my hard work. I literally spent a solid year completely avoiding any review, comment or notation regarding this film. Trust me, in this Information Existence, this was no easy task. Quickly clicking off pages or even shutting down browsers to avoid the unavoidable pop-ups and hot links; changing the channel or muting whenever a story or advert hit the screen. For me, a serious endeavor that ate up a good portion of daily mental energy. So that when it finally came time - this was as fresh and clean as the driven snow. Had absolutely no idea what the film was about, who it starred, or even what theme the film could be categorized in. Pure ignorant bliss. (a more appropriate term would've been 'flick virgin' - but that somehow seemed vulgar) &lt;g><br /><br />- "Just so you know - I'm massively stoned right now."<br /><br />- "Drugs are so bad!"<br /><br />BWHAHAHAHA!  X-D

review/summary: Homeward Bound
review/text: This is a J.J. Abrams movie, a science fiction period piece (circa 1980) set in small town America. There isn't a main actor, but rather an ensemble of kids that fulfill that role. But then the kids are the stars of the movie. Their acting is excellent, their characters filled out--and very believable.<br /><br />However, the same can't be said for the three main supporting adults, in that their characters are only partially fleshed out.  And the evil one is too evil, stopping just short of being a caricature of evil.<br /><br />This is a relatively fast paced movie. I never got bored. And though there are some semi-scary scenes--meaning it may not be suitable for very young children--this is not a quasi-horror movie (IMO). It's science fiction, albeit not in the classical sense. This is not about technology, so you'll want to gloss over some of what you see.  It's a feel good movie, a story of childhood friendships.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />An alien creature captured by the military (many years ago) finally escapes as it's being transported across country. This happens outside the small town where the children live. Of course, the military descend on the town and surrounding area. As for the alien, in its quest to return home, it wreaks havoc on the military and town.

review/summary: Enjoyable movie, but kind of falls a bit flat. (potential SPOILERS)
review/text: I have read alot about parallels to E.T. and such regarding this movie. I would say those are loose comparisons at best. While there is a scene that is specifically reminiscent of E.T., this movie is quite a bit different.<br />The alien, for one, actually eats people, and is far from the small, cute, and cuddly alien featured in E.T...also, it doesnt really develop relationships with people. It is seeking a way to "go home", as it were, and there is a military quarantine.<br />Anyway, the cast was pretty good, and the interaction between the featured children (of tween age i think) was decent. The premise that they were filming a zombie movie when they end up witnessing a train derail, which ends up freeing the alien, was pretty cool. The local animals fleeing the area (presumably due to the presence of an unnaturally large predator) seemed like something that would actually happen.<br /><br />Where the movie falls flat to me is...the alien is a massive predator, eating people, and destroying a bunch of stuff, but is also cast as a sympathetic character. They try to rationalize this approach by saying that it learned to hate humans after it was initially captured (Roswell), held prisoner, tortured and tested upon by our military scientists. It is able to communicate telepathically through contact (would that be empathically?). Still, it doesnt seem to care about the humans it captures for food, even though they are just ordinary folks with no ties to the military or their scientists. Yet, when the star tween touches him, he suddenly decides not to eat anybody else, and rather focus on finishing his ship and leaving.<br /><br />There is no fond farewell, no conversation outside of a single empathic moment between the tween and the alien. It just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is left to pick up the pieces of a shattered town. Presumably, the gov't would later say a hallucinogenic gas was released into the air accidentally by way of a weather balloon causing the locals to see things as they destroyed their own town (at least, i figure that is how this would play out in real life). The movie though...it just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is happy (outside of those people who were killed by the now seemingly misunderstood alien). To me, the movie was basically a big build up where everybody is scared which then shifts suddenly and tries to become a social consciousness type message about kindness and understanding. Didnt really work for me. No real peak...the movie just kind of flatlined.<br />Had i known before watching this that JJ Abrams was the responsible party, i would probably have skipped this one, since i know better than to trust any project he is involved with. Nonetheless, i dont regret watching this movie, but i was far from impressed.

review/summary: Collage of E.T., Close Encounters and other such stuff
review/text: J.J. Abrams - Director / Writer / Producer presents us with a love story that incidentally is visited now and then by an alien.  Marketed as a sort of kids "Blaire Witch" story, the film is a pale reflection of "The Goonies" (1985.)<br /><br />Basically kids making a movie witness a train wreck and possibly something else. We know that they are in trouble as "poof" out of nowhere men in uniforms with flashlights appears.<br /><br />There is a disclaimer in the beginning of the film but there does seem to be a lot of gratuitous potty mouth in the presentation.<br /><br />Even if the plot was formula and many times formula can be fun, Elle Fanning excelled as a zombie. See her earlier works as Phoebe Lichten in "Phoebe in Wonderland" (2008).

review/text: Cinematography was superb. Exactly the quality you expect from Spielberg and Abrams. It reminded me of Cloverfield, E.T., and The Goonies all rolled into one. The kids were excellent actors.<br /><br />However, once you reach the end of the film you feel as though you missed something somewhere, as though this film was part 2 of a 2-part film. Something was greatly lacking in the story. In E.T. for example, the alien and the boy slowly build a relationship so that you feel for them in their emotional parting. But in the case of Super8, the alien and boy are total strangers but behave as though they had built some wonderful relationship between them. The boy seemed to have discovered something endearing about the alien that the audience is not privy to and is unrealistically brave and devoid of fear when put face to face with a nightmarish creature that hardened military men feared. As the alien sailed away in his spaceship, all I could think was, "Farewell... who ever you were...".

review/summary: Old School Story Telling
review/text: Remember when movie makers used to spend most of their budget on writing and telling a good story, instead of spending all the money on special effects and the remainder on the script?  Super 8 is such a movie.  The plot revolves around a group of kids, a few of whom are dealing with losses in their life.  I don't want to spoil the story so I will stick to what was shown in the trailers.  A late night train crashes.  Precious and unusual cargo was inside the train.  The movie revolves around the mystery of what was in the train and what is the cause for strange happenings in the town.  The kids in this movie are all great actors.  The story is great and full of suspense.  The setting of 1979 is actually very cool (which I did not expect it to be.)  The movie is pg-13 but I was surprised at the language.  It wasn't too brutal, but clearly the language police were lenient with the language in this movie.  Despite the language, the movie is a great one to watch with your family.  I had on the subtitles so maybe I was more aware of the language than I otherwise would have been.  With all the garbage, throw away movies made this year, Super 8 was a nice suprise.

review/text: This is not a good movie, it's meant for kids but surprisingly given the pg13 cert. because of profanity and coarse language spoken by the child actors. It's shocking to hear that fat movie director character in this film bossing the other ones who are smaller and thinner than him around and that's why I would not recommend it to parents for a Sunday afternoon viewing with their kids. Very similar to cloverfield except the main characters are all tweenagers. Maybe it was intended as a prequel to cloverfield. No ones noticed it but me.. Yeah I think I'm the only one who does. mr Abrams must stop all this friends stumbling upon aliens type of idea.. It just doesn't work anymore. Don't buy the movie, rent it instead.

review/summary: A SUPER Movie!
review/text: Super 8 is about a group of kids shooting a zombie movie for a local Super 8 Film festival. While filming on location at a train depot, they witness a colossal train wreck, which, just to throw out there, is simply amazing! After the wreck, odd things begin to happen around the town, and soon the kids find themselves facing something that would bring them all closer together, and experience danger, love, and life. This movie truly has the old Spielberg feel of ET, Close Encounters, and the Goonies. Its young child actors, especially Joel Courtney's lead performance, and his debut, are outstanding and really bring this film to glory. JJ Abrams has definitely rekindled the spirit of the 70's and 80's and hopefully will continue doing projects such as these. As a teenager, I enjoyed this film immensely, and it made me feel emotions towards the end, that a film has not been able to do for a long time. Along with the score, JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg make an AWESOME team, and this movie was SUPER SUPER Good!

review/summary: Super 8 - Delightfully Expected
review/text: I saw the trailers for Super 8 in theater when I watched other movies in theater. When I saw the glimpses, even with some of the earlier trailers, I found myself reminded about a good deal of the Anime I've seen for the Sci-Fi and/or Horror genre. Particularly the ones that happened to touch upon the scientific technology only slightly, and the horror is minute. The draw for these Anime is the actual storyline and the characters. Normally I find myself not interested in watching American movies for this genre, but when I saw the trailers, I found myself wanting to watch the movies at least once.<br /><br />When the movie popped up on the big screen , I found that my comparisons to the Anime I like from those two genre was not far off at all. While the subject of "the thing" and other scientific elements crop up in the movie, not to mention there are a few times I felt a slight terror running through my mind, I felt that it wasn't over done. Instead, the movie focused on the characters and the plot line. I found myself drawn into the whole thing.<br /><br />The characters came to life in my mind. Each of the children in their group had their own distinct personalities. There are also quite a bit of growing up issues presented within the movie, dealt with in a believable fashion. There is also the issue with dealing with parents that are over bearing. The movie is one of those that one should watch at least once, despite the fact that Spielberg does over do the detail when it comes to certain things, but that only adds to the fantastical element in the story. Not to mention it is expected of his work.<br /><br />I got what I expected out of the movie. There was a great plot, a nice romance story that came across as  believable, not to mention age appropriate was also in there. The story line had quite a few cliches in it, but in the long run the plot flowed smoothly from beginning to end. It has some similarities to one of his earlier work of E.T, but the story fits more into the time frame.

review/summary: Not Without My Mother
review/text: Can you say, "E.T." meets "E.T."?  Arguably the most E.T. like movie of all time, Super 8 starts up with a bang and runs through every trick in the ET playbook before the first hour is up, then goes back in again and again to expand on the one thing it knows.  That thing is the essential mystery of childhood and how, once we become adults, we lose our innate understanding of aliens from other planets.  Happily for movie buffs, Super 8 tells the story of six brave kids teetering on the brink of adolescence, and sets the story in the late 1970s so we can all identify, even the middle-aged like me.  E.T. showed us a family led by a mother and father, but Super 8 presents the children at risk because their mothers have been snatched away from them by a cruel factory death.  Reading between the lines, smart viewers will notice that only one mother remains, and she is played by Jessica Tuck, the vampire spokesperson from True Blood--what's that saying about motherhood?  I have no idea, but I'm sure that Steven Spielberg's casting is always saying something pertinent, unlike his scripts.  (Next up, Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis as Abe, and Sally Field, short, sixtyish and moonfaced, as weird Mary Todd.  Everyone's wondering, will Anne Hathaway play Anne Hathaway, Lincoln's first love?)<br /><br />Knowledge is power, summer films say, yet in Super 8 this harmless dictum is severely smashed.  In tracing the fate of the one roll of Super 8 film that accidentally records a horrific train wreck, director JJ Abrams convinces us that somehow this footage, which incidentally shows a monster rising from the wreckage, is going to be important in the denouement.  Like Hitchcock's McGuffins, the footage is presented pictorially as a matter of great consequence, and in addition it becomes a matter about which we the audience know more than the kids on screen.  Lo and behold, absolutely nothing of consequence occurs with this footage and we feel cheated, like children without a mother.  It's a great movie, even with that awful instant nostalgia factor suffusing the whole thing like air freshener.  Aliens with the minds of kids: will Hollywood, will Spielberg, ever abandon this theme?  Not on this earth.

review/summary: THE Summer action movie of 2011
review/text: See this movie, see it in the theater with a big screen!<br /><br />I am not familiar with JJ Abrams but he definitely is a student of Lucas and producer Spielberg.<br /><br />The only name actor in the movie is Kyle Chandler as  Jack Lamb, who for years has played small town Texas high school football Coach Eric Taylor on the well-acted but under-watched TV series "Friday Night Lights". Lamb is an overwhelmed police deputy here with the same intensity and focus as Chandler has on "Friday Night Lights"<br /><br />Set in 1979 in small town Ohio, a group of five dorky middle school kids with a lot of braces and pimples including deputy Lamb's son Joe (Played by Joel Courtney) , decide to make a zombie movie shot on Super 8 film, the low budget media of the day. The movie is seen through their eyes. They want to enter a statewide amateur movie contest. They enlist the help of love interest Alice, from the wrong side of town, played by Elle Fanning (Dakota Fannings little sister). Alice unexpectedly turns out to be a great actress, jawdroppingly good. The kids go to the train station to get more "production values" in their zombie movie. A train goes by while they are shooting and then wrecks spectacularly. I won't say more, but there are plenty of plot twists and turns.<br /><br />Movie starts out silly and slow paced teen movie but rapidly picks up speed intensity and focus. Action/adventure, suspense, mystery, menace, scifi, a creature and a lot of strange events. Like the best of George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg, Super 8 is it's own movie, but pulls in bits and pieces from various "Indiana Jones", "ET", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Alien". In a season with a lot of formulaic less-than-super, predictable superhero movies, this is the action movie to see!<br /><br />Highest recommendation! The kind of great action movie that just doesn't seem to be made anymore. Emotionally intense.

review/summary: Created By Brilliant Talent
review/text: First of all, I want to acknowledge the outstanding performance of the little girl in the movie, named Alice (portrayed by the beautiful Elle Fanning). From the beginning of the movie, to the end of it, Elle Fanning never ceased to intrigue and completely "wow" us! A mysterious character Alice is, who often displays empathic tendencies (in my opinion) and I wondered if she was playing the role of an empath. I think it is possible that such a tinge was written into her character, but also not highlighted so much as to draw too much attention to that idea. I have never seen a child perform so well in a movie, ever (at least I cannot remember) and the fact that I can't remember anyone else means that Elle Fanning has outshone every other performance by a child actor that I have ever seen! Elle Fanning was breathtaking in this film, aside from being beautiful, she manages to communicate what the character is feeling, and impart that unto the viewer just by the expressions communicated through her eyes. Outstanding, excellent acting! I will be looking out more for this young actor, I believe that she will make it very big and very far in her profession. Amazing.<br /><br />Now, onto the movie... I want to stress that this movie contains the worst language I have ever heard being spoken in a movie, in all my life. Seriously. And the fact that children are saying all these profane words makes it very hard to swallow. I was watching with my ten year old son (the country in which we live rated it GP) and I don't agree with the GP rating of this movie, due to the extremely foul language! With that being said, I believe that we can't hide our children away from the world and protect them from knowing what the realities of the world are (like bad language) and at the time we watched this movie, my son was already prepared to hear all that language. I told him after the movie that I trust and know and have enough faith in him to say that this movie was a great movie, because I know that just because he hears or sees something, doesn't mean he's going to do it. In the end, we both agreed that this was a really great movie! Brilliant, actually! I am blown away and I truly admire the talent and brains behind the script, the story, the plot, the flow, cinematography, everything really! However, if you have children that are not yet prepared to hear how the rest of the world talks, don't take them to see this movie (if it's rated GP also where you live), because they definitely WILL find out how the rest of the world talks, by watching it! Terrible language! The thing is, that's life!<br /><br />From the very start, this film did not fail to deliver intense punches in the face; intense emotional drama, intense thrilling scenes, intense effects, and I often found myself breathing deep sighs just to relieve myself of the tension I was feeling. So, it starts out very intensely and is very intriguing! But then it later succumbs to humor and the movie progresses into something truly hilarious (in a good way) and I have not laughed so much in a movie house, in a very very long time!!!!! Hilarious! Just so so funny!!!!! The lines, the characters, scenes, just hilarious!!!! This is the portrayal of true talent and genius behind the film, because, when delivering so much intensity in the beginning of a movie, it is wise to bring the viewers into a whole different realm later on by introducing an equally intense amount of humor!!! It was hysterically funny at times, and this is the point at which I truly began to appreciate the movie and it really did begin to shine, for me!<br /><br />I would classify Super 8 as a science fiction thriller, but, due to the genius creating it, the film is able to contain the science fiction to the sidelines, and what really takes the limelight is the emotional backdrop of the main characters, this story is at last strongly character-driven and emotionally true. The science fiction part simply becomes just a thing that happened in the lives of these extraordinarily strong characters. Sort of how things happen in all of our lives that seem to come in on a train derailment and wreck havoc in us but in the end and after it all, these things that happen are just things that happen, and life is meant to be lived. I do believe that is the true message of the story, and it is built into and built up by the plot and the script and the acting, thus producing a very strong delivery of this single message.<br /><br />The movie wraps-up beautifully, I cannot over-emphasize that. The beautiful wrap-up of everything surely makes up for the very foul language and sometimes hard-to-look-at bloody scenes. In the end, the fathers both learn that the most important things in their lives aren't the things and the people that they have lost, but the most important realities in their lives are the people that are in front of their eyes: their own children. The children in turn learn how to let go of pain and forgive, I think that everyone learns forgiveness and letting go in this story.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is like life itself: it is at times hard to swallow, but in the end it's beautiful and we all learn the most important things.

review/summary: It's NOT "The Goonies"
review/text: The "Goonies", "Stand By Me's", and "ET's" of my day were way better. Super 8 tries to be a coming of age story, but falls way short. Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?

review/summary: Entertaining at first, but disappoints in the end.
review/text: This movie does a good job of building tension, investing you in the characters, and keeping you in the moment, and then it blows it in the last half hour or so. Others have complained about the long, overly dark sequence and I would like to hurl that charge again with some English on it. About ten minutes of squinting at the screen and I no longer cared the slightest bit what was going on, having given up in exasperation. Toward the end of that sequence, the movie segues into its cliched Spielbergian ending. One minute you're watching Alien and the next it's E.T. Ultimately Super 8 was like a punctured tire...it began at high speed and full of pressure, became floppy and hard to steer toward the end, and finally came to a grinding halt, completely deflated.

review/summary: derivative and disappointing
review/text: I've been watching movies for 60 years, and there's little I haven't seen. For me, an "old" movie is a silent film ("Orphans of the Storm").<br /><br />Movie makers seem to think that, despite the wide availability of decades of films on home video, they can get away with recycling stuff most viewers have seen. This is the case with "Super 8", a rough mash-up of "ET", "CE3K", and "Jurassic Park". Had these films never been made, "Super 8" would come off as agreeably original. But when all the viewer can do is think of how much "Super 8" reminds him of //other// films, something is wrong.<br /><br />"Super 8"'s worst problem is that it depends too heavily on coincidence and obvious foreshadowing. When one of the young film makers displays a proclivity for lighting small fireworks, you //know// it's going to come in handy later. And why is it that the train //just happens// to pass near the community where the man who tries to stop it resides?<br /><br />Spoiler follows.<br /><br />The obvious question of why the Air Force is moving the alien and his paraphernalia is never answered. A plausible explanation is that they're finally going to let him leave. If so, the events of the film are highly ironic. The "bad guys" aren't quite so bad, while the "good guy" is the person who incites the tragedy. Had "Super 8" included this revelation, I'd probably have given it four stars.<br /><br />Michael Giacchino's score is a dud. It comes off as watered-down Williams -- which might have been his intent, a subtle slap at the film itself.<br /><br />In short, "by the numbers" movie making. J J Abrams should be ashamed -- and ought to take a refresher course from Robert McKee.<br /><br />PS: A note to the costume department... In a film with millions of dollars of special effects, the wig for the guy playing the hippie salesman is incomprehensibly awful. The "part" in the wig appears to be a part of the wig -- not hair growing out of his scalp. John Wayne had better hairpieces 50+ years ago, and Robert Duvall's "do" for "Lonesome Dove" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for "Super 8".

review/summary: A New Classic Summer Film, and one of best of 2011.
review/text: J.J. Abrams, as a creator, has been something of an amalgam. He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure "Summer" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements into one big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, "That was a great film and it will always be a great film". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.

review/text: A beautiful, nostalgic film capturing a more innocent style of filmmaking along with a more innocent view of adolescent adventure and romance than we generally see in movies now. And yet it also feels more truthful than the jaded, pessimistic, and self-indulgently bombastic threat-escalation that pervades most modern adventure films. This film trusts the threat it introduces to be sufficient without unnecessary multiplication.<br /><br />The performances by the "kids" in the cast are spot-on believable as actual children just beginning to mature. Elle Fanning in particular is a revelation and definitely looks to be an actress to watch for.

review/summary: Thin line between homage and derivative . . . SUPER-8 goes both ways
review/text: I was thrilled by the trailer for this film with the truck racing head-on to derail the US Air Force freight train and the awesome collision that appears to release some creature within one of its cars.  Alas, that amazing footage is nowhere to be found in the film itself.  The film has such a Spielbergian feel to it, it becomes sport to find which camera shot was from E.T. and which one was from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.<br /><br />JJ Abrams is likely the most talented filmmaker around (LOST, and reboots of Mission: Impossible as well as Star Trek).  The 1979 setting in Ohio provides a great authenticity; you feel you know everything about this town -- and the atmosphere is spot-on.  The acting is terrific as well.  The mysterious premise draws you in as well.<br /><br />But the film tests your patience midway through.  The film relies substantially on what you don't see off-screen -- think BLAIR WITCH PROJECT kind of off-screen.  After awhile, the creature seems to be just a cousin of that unseen force that terrorized characters on the island in LOST.  It also makes a weird noise like the creature in James Cameron's "Aliens.".  God, there's several scenes that look like they were digitally "borrowed" from that film.<br /><br />And the ending, meant to be as emotionally evocative as a blend of ET and Close Encounters, was oddly unsatisfying.  Yeah, it's digitally spectacular -- how could it not be -- and how those mysterious cubes came into play was a stroke of genius.  Still, the wide-eyed awed expressions of the actors that so many on this comment stream complained about, is tiresome.  Oh, and by the way, the driver of the pick-up truck would be strawberry jelly after the head-on impact with the train.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />JJ, it was a gorgeous film, but it was a bit too much of an homage to 1970s Spielberg.  The creature we're meant to care about was bizarre and menancing.  No wide-eyed E.T., that one.

review/text: Super 8 is about kids.  Their problems, their ingenuity, bravery, friendships, and foibles.  Spielberg didn't invent this genre, Robert Louis Stevenson did.  Such stories give kids their due for their smarts and integrity.  Abrams is growing as a director.  This and Start Trek are two of the best science fiction films made this century.  In a film world where *men* dressed like ten year-olds are passed off as good science fiction, I'll take a movie where the kids have heart and make the tough decisions.  There's no comparison really.  Super 8 is solid story telling, the real deal.

Righteous FX<br /><br />But the biggest reason I liked 8 was the sentimentality of it, something Spiel is a master of. He makes me remember being a kid and having dreams, biking around and thinking about nothing except the moment, wishing for the pretty girl to say hi, the posters and models - it just touched my heart. So thanks, Spiel and Abrams. You guys made me remember.<br /><br />It's a perfect summer film. Not taxing on the mind, just a slice of "Ah, I used to be like that."

review/summary: release the alien
review/text: Spielberg and J.J. Abrams got together to do homage to the former's earlier adventure time and alien movies and filming old school style and then used a bunch of CGI effects to do it. Did they want to say, see CGI can be used to create the same experience?<br />J.J. Abrams Loves flare. (Flare are the flashes of light across the screen that occur from reflection on the lens. It is gay especially when excessively present, which it is).<br />This movie is loaded out the hole with metaphors for coming of age psychological-social drama. In small town USA. The train carrying the monster alien crashes into the kids as love/lust blossoms. The girl and boy and their two daddies' conflict and the mother's death.. Girl tells boy not to give up his train for the domineering fat boy. The oppressed alien is released from it's subterranean dwelling, builds it's rocket ship on the town's tallest structure and launches off -after the boy tells the alien it can live and be free. The town is destroyed in the process and the ultimate symbol of society's repressive, overwhelming force (the military) is overcome. And if you aren't paying attention you still get the scene when the boy symbolically lets go of the chain his mother gave him and it becomes part of the alien's ship.<br />Maybe it worked better on paper.

Bad military.  In the end, the alien gets away.  This kind of movie has been done a few times before.  Nothing new here.  Just different actors and a different looking alien.  The only redeeming value was when the 2 parents stopped fighting and started helping each other near the end of the movie.

review/summary: Four plus two divided by two equals three.
review/text: This is really two movies. One is a rather charming film about a group of young film-makers trying to put together a super 8 movie in the late 1970s. Their interaction with each other and with the fathers of the principal boy and girl are well realised and believable, helped along by some excellent performances (I especially liked Joel Courtney's clever differentiation of his delivery when he is acting and when he is 'acting' in the super 8 movie). In the special features director J.J. Abrams refers to his own experiences as a young film-maker and it's clear to see that he is incorporating more than a little of himself in this part of the movie. Four stars for this section of the film.<br /><br />The other movie is a sci-fi flick about a derailed train and what escapes from it. The two stories are linked together (though only just) by the escape having been caught by the super 8 camera, left running when the train derailment causes the young movie-makers to scatter. This part of Abrams' movie is a tribute to Steven Spielberg, who also participated as a producer. It's not nearly as successful, both because almost everything is derived from Spielberg's movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s and also because hardly anything is given any explanation. We're left sitting there pointing out techniques from Close Encounters or E.T., but not knowing why they're being used. At the end, we know what happened, but not why- and without the why, the whole story makes no sense. Two stars for this part of the movie.<br /><br />So four stars plus two stars, divided by the two parts of the movie, equals three stars. But do watch the final credits to see how the super 8 movie turned out.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND? POLTERGEIST?? Well, SUPER 8 is probably as close to those glorious days as we'll ever get! Filled w/ great characters (especially the kids), a perfectly-realized 1970s town, and an alien connection, S8 delivers those wonderful goosebumps that I haven't felt since I was a kid myself! Director J.J. Abrams and Producer Spielberg have brought back the magic! Hell, I damn near cried! Highly recommended...

review/text: The movie has no real plot, and the characters are not believable at all.  The 'alien' is kept in shadows at all times like used to happen in the really old sci-fi movies where it was done due to how hard it was to make the alien believable.  Attempts to communicate with the alien are just absurd, and lead to an anti-climatic ending.  This is like a modern version of those really, really bad sci-fi B-movies of the 50's and 60's.

review/summary: A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love. Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B
review/text: "Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die." When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like "Cloverfield" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of "Cloverfield" and "Stand By Me" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.<br /><br />*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline

review/summary: Super Aliens
review/text: The Review:<br /><br />When Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams get together to make a movie, rest assured it's going to be good.  The only question is just how good. Super 8 is a mash-up of E.T. and Cloverfield.  That's an oversimplification and a big disservice to the hard work that went into Super 8, which stands on its own two feet as a sci-fi movie with a lot of heart.  Much of that heart comes from Super 8's child actors who far outshine most of their adult counterparts this movie season.  Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning stand out in the two lead roles, but everyone in the movie did an A+ job, at times capturing the camaraderie of films like Stand by Me as well as the sense of wild eyed adventure from Goonies.<br /><br />Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends in an Ohio steel town who witness a cataclysmic train crash, inadvertently capturing it on a super 8 movie camera while making a student film. It's clear that something monstrous was aboard that train and made its escape during the crash. When the U.S. Air force comes to town, local law man, Jackson Lamb does his best to get to the bottom of a series of disappearances and thefts that plague the town in the wake of the crash.  But the civilians who know the most about what happened the night of the crash are the kids who witnessed it while shooting their super 8 movie, including Jackson's son, Joe.<br /><br />Super 8 does an excellent job of taking you along the adventure with its characters.  You'll uncover the mystery alongside them. Unlike a who done it, I never felt the need to guess who or what was behind all the craziness. Super 8 just took me along for a crazy ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it, and as with the best thrill rides I totally lost track of the time.  Going into the movie I feared there would be a boring half hour build up or some down time, as there is in a lot of 2 hour movies. I'm looking at you A.I. I couldn't have been more wrong. Super 8 is pitch perfect. Action, laughs, human drama and a few scares. It's all there.  I won't spoil the set piece action scenes in this review, but there is one in particular which is the best I've seen so far this year, and that includes action tour de forces like Source Code, Thor, and X-Men: First Class.<br /><br />Special mention must be made at how the film makers captured 1979 down to the tiniest detail. Super 8 doubles as a time warp the same way Mad Men does with Don Draper and company. To sum it up, Super 8 is a must see and it's very much a big screen movie experience, even at today's inflated ticket prices.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.

review/summary: Terrific Story with Wonderful Acting
review/text: Super 8 was a far more interesting film that I thought. The trailers didn't look very interesting and what convinced me to see the movie were comments I heard on the radio. A comment that I recalled was that the first half of the film was like a Steven Spielberg movie (not surprising, as he was a producer) with the second half like a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.  I came away feeling the film was an excellent tribute to Mr. Spielberg.<br /><br />The story is set in a small suburb in 1979 and focuses of a group of movie-making kinds (much like Spielberg and writer-director J. J. Abrams themselves) who are making a zombie film.  The characters have their own deep conflicts centering on the death of Joel Lamb's mother (sensitively acted by Joel Courtney). Joel's father, a deputy sheriff (Kyle Chandler providing an excellent performance) has a strong dislike for one of his deceased wife's co-workers Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard). This causes problems in a budding romance between for Joel and Alice Dainard (beautifully played by Elle Fanning).  Everything changes when the kids observe a train derailment, documented on their Super 8 camera that allows an alien creature to escape.<br /><br />The feel of the movie was closer to ET for me with the kids knowing more than the adults and knowing what needs to happen once they have all the facts about what is going on.  This is a beautifully acted film with some excellent special effects that add to the viewing experience without being gratuitous.  I think Super 8 is the kind of film that can be enjoyed more when seen the second or third times.  It is fun to watch and the details of the story and the performances can be appreciated when watched again.

review/text: "Super 8" is essentially "ET" on steroids, but while it's produced by Steven Spielberg it lacks the emotional force of a Spielberg movie.  The characters aren't really likeable or credible, making their many attempts at creating emotion uncomfortable to watch.  Despite Abrams' reputation for spinning a good yarn, there isn't much of a story here.  All in all, this is a very bad ET re-make, and everyone would be better off re-watching the original.

review/summary: JJ Abrams 'phones home' a winner
review/text: JJ Abrams holds school on how to properly "rip off" a genre. You just feel the electricity of E.T. running through the kids, the neighborhoods, and right on through to yourself.<br /><br />Aside from a few seemingly needless and annoying plot holes, this movie works (But JJ, can you please explain to me again how the alien got his ship back together?). Everything else works though, from the cool alien technology (small shift-shaping cubes that that can form into anything), to the seamless effects, to the nothing-short-of-brilliant acting by the child actors. There are a few pure JJ one-liners that you'll miss if you're not paying attention, like "Drugs are bad" from the mouth of one of the kids as he abandons hope that the passed out stoner who has been their ride will be of any further help. In the context of the movie this line is hilarious.<br /><br />Fasten your seat belts with regard to the sprouting acting career of 14 year old Elle Fanning. This young lady was born to the profession. Her moving, and at the same time disturbing performance in 'Phoebe in Wonderland' at age 8 blew my mind. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when Elle turns from a human being into a ghoul in one single shot. At the top of the shot she is simply wearing face paint in a closeup. When prompted, she turns her head down, her eyes up... and without even changing expressions transforms into a scary monster. Chilling. You go Elle!

review/text: First off, I took a gamble and picked this up on Blu for a couple bucks cheaper than Amazon's current price. Picture & sound quality are superb. If you are a fan of this movie, you'll love the transfer.<br /><br />For an adult Sci-Fi movie fan, I thought this was far better than the likes of "Cowboys vs. Aliens," (which wasn't bad) and "Real Steel," (which was really bad).<br /><br />The movie is derivative (you will detect elements of "Stand by Me," "E.T.," "Gremlins," etc.) but it does have a good, plausible storyline for a sci-fi film, with decent performances by the (mostly adolescent)cast.<br /><br />It isn't as gritty as "Cloverfield," nor is it quite as heartwarming as "E.T.," but like those films, it is good sci-fi entertainment, and well worth taking a chance on if you haven't seen it yet.

review/text: This movie is in a class of its own.  It would be difficult to say if this is coming of age movie, drama science fiction or a zombie movie but it is a mix of all for sure.  Set in  1980s it is a story of five high school buddies determined to make their zombie movie.  Bad things happen along the way: one of the boys looses his mother in the accident in a factory where she works; there is an alien on the loose in the small town; and all of these events are interfering with the make of the teeneage zombie movie.<br /><br />It must have been a fun project for Steven Speilberg and his mentoree J. J. Abrams to make.  But do not expect high art.  It is simply a fun movie to watch with no strings attached.

review/text: The elements in this movie are pretty standard for this genre: wide-eyed enthusiastic kids, some of which have serious personal problems; a small cozy town where everyone knows each other; a branch of the military engaged in a secret program of questionable ethics; an ugly alien creature which crashed on our planet and just wants to return to home, but has been detained and tormented enough to make it dangerous, but it still has a heart; lots of impressive special effects; and a relatively happy ending.<br /><br />If all these elements came together well enough, this could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, some of these elements felt like caricatures, and their blending often felt contrived.  In other words, the movie felt too formulaic, rather than developing from a fully matured vision.<br /><br />I asked my daughter what she thought of it, and she said it was good, but she didn't love it.  I guess I felt about the same.  I suppose you could do worse than to watch it, but I can't strongly endorse it.  Certainly not destined to become a classic.

review/summary: J.J. Abrams's love letter to Generation X, Spielberg, and Debbie Harry
review/text: After weeks and months of speculation, the thing is unveiled. And, it turns out, what SUPER 8 is, is a blast from the past, a nostalgic kick of cinema. And it's good, it's really good. There's a kid in this film who, whenever he thought something was cool, would remark, "That was mint!" Well, sir, SUPER 8 was mint.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is set in 1979, in the heartland town of Lillian, Ohio. Four months after the death of his mother at the local steel factory, 12-year-old Joe Lamb and his dad are grieving still, Joe's dad, a Sheriff's Deputy, still so affected that he's become estranged from his son. Joe at least has got his friends to distract him. It's summer now, school in the rearview for a while, and Joe's promised to help out his good chubby buddy (and budding filmmaker) Charles with his 8mm zombie movie, hopefully to be finished in time for an upcoming film festival. Joe builds train models, but he's also handy with monster make-up.<br /><br />Joe is particularly stoked to learn that his dream girl, Alice, will be acting in the picture. Joe and his friends (and Alice) all agree to sneak out at night and shoot scenes at the local train station. But then their little horror film gets upstaged when a military train rumbles by and derails spectacularly. And that's the start of a series of mysterious and frightening events befalling the town of Lillian.<br /><br />Joe Lamb, observant and early on tapped as the prospective protagonist, notes that something has punched thru the steel confines of one of the box cars. Soon after, the town suffers persistent fluctuations in electrical power, dogs are running away, and people are vanishing, as well as automobile parts and various everyday household items. And the U.S. Air Force has come to town, behaving oddly and sweeping the town streets and fiddling with their instruments. In the air wafts the smell of  a military cover-up.<br /><br />In a nod to the paranoid 1950s sci-fi flicks, certain of the townspeople blame the Red Menace. Joe and his friends know better. They've seen stuff, including these weird little cubes. But they were warned, warned by the only other person to have witnessed the train crash (and he actually caused it). If the kids talk, "they" will get them... and their parents, too. Except that this is the kind of movie in which the adults are the ones milling around, perplexed, and kids are the only ones who can save the day. I'm all for this kind of movie.<br /><br />This is intentionally a throwback film. And it throws me back to that era, when disco was at its last gasp. When the Walkman was the latest revolutionary leap in music accessibility. When sexy Debbie Harry was doing her thing. When the Three Mile Island disaster was still topical.  When folks said things like "gnarly." SUPER 8 will resonate with just about everyone, but even more strongly with those falling in the Generation X bracket. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams has learned well at the master's feet. Much of what's in SUPER 8 evokes classic Spielberg. This story is darker and with a harder, more brutal edge, but somewhere in it you can catch glimpses of E.T. and THE GOONIES. Only, the special effects are much more lavish. Even if Abrams teases you for much of the film by only revealing shadowy bits of the terrifying alien set loose in the tiny town.<br /><br />Abrams constructs a good mystery, and he's excellent with staging the reveals. All of that doesn't impress me as much as how he handles the story's human elements, or, more specifically, how good he is with those scenes showcasing the children. He treats these scenes - which are all a homage to adolescence - with clear affection and humor and perceptiveness. More, he obviously feels a kinship to these kid characters who, just like him at that age, are avid film buffs and amateur filmmakers. Somewhere, in a producer's chair, polishing his Oscars, Spielberg must've been beaming, just beaming. It helps that the two child leads, Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are so terrific. They hit those emotional beats just perfect. I also got love for that firecracker-obsessed pal of theirs who is certainly destined to be a future arsonist. What's less excellent - partly because it's resolved in such a perfunctory manner - is how Joe and his dad's strained relationship is developed. Also, Joe's dad (Kyle Chandler) seems slated to have a bigger role to play in the story. But, it turns out, not so much. And, if you're anticipating a full-on E.T.-type interaction between the kids and the alien, prepare to be thwarted. For the most part, this alien is nothing like E.T. ***SPOILER FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCE ONLY*** SUPER 8 shows what well may have happened to E.T. if the military had gotten its hands on him before Eliott did. SUPER 8 is watchable because the premise hooks you in and Abrams knows storytelling. But, for my money, it elevates to must-see status because these kid actors are so good at their craft and because Abrams does well with evoking a child's natural sense of wonder. It's all mint, baby.<br /><br />And mind that you stay for Charles's completed zombie film (titled "The Case") which plays during the closing credits.

review/text: Most of the action was in the dark, which is usually meant to mask really bad special effects. I found myself bored fifteen minutes into the film, advancing it, with hopes of improvement, better acting, effects, something, but it never came. If you have really nothing better to do, don't watch this movie still, just sit and stare at the wall, it's brighter and more entertaining.

review/summary: Very Disapointing
review/text: If you just like special effects and little else you may enjoy this hodgepodge of a film. I remember Spielberg reminiscing on a TCM special about "Epic Films", how he was influenced as a kid by Cecil B. DeMille's train wreck sequence in the film, "The Greatest Show On Earth". It's redone  here and it's even more spectacular, but it would have benefited greatly if there had been some suspense leading up to it! After that scene, the film deteriorates into every mediocre Sci-Fi film of the Fifties, except with much bigger special effects. The ending is much like "E.T." and "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind", but without any of the charm of those films, or really making much sense! In fact the whole film borrows heavily on the "E.T." theme of the misunderstood, but in this case, brutally tortured alien, just wanting to go home. The ending, despite all of the visual effects, is actually a little cheesy, although we're supposed to feel awe inspired.<br />The whole movie is disjointed and it really pains me to write such a bad review for any film that Spielberg is associated with, but the film leaves the viewer with way too many unanswered questions, and it's really a huge letdown in almost every department! I actually found myself "redirecting" and "rewriting" this movie in my head as I was watching it, and that's NOT a good sign!

review/summary: Didn't have the "magic" I expected
review/text: I've been a fan of J.J. Abrams since Lost, Cloverfield, and the reboot of Star Trek.  Paired with Steven Spielberg, I was expecting something great, especially when critics were praising this film so highly.  Many people will say it's a cross between The Goonies, ET, and several other childhood films, which I will agree is *mostly* correct.  However, I found that it seems to lose it's tone about halfway through and the overall theme of childhood innocence gets lost.<br /><br />I will say the acting is fantastic.  With children as lead actors, their roles are cast perfectly.  A little cliched, perhaps, but the band of friends fits well.  Kyle Chandler as the sheriff/father fits his role quite nicely as well.  The premise builds a nice story of a strained father-son relationship after the death of the mother, as well as takes us through the bonds of friendship and the childhood fun of making a home movie.  On a cinematic standpoint, the camerawork and score work well with the film.  Abrams has always gone over the top to drop the audience into a colorfully distinctive world full of emotion and life, and this film is no different.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy were certain elements to the alien/monster itself, which caused the story to stray from being about childhood innocence amidst a supernatural crisis to being about children stuck in a violent battle between humans and the alien.  Ignoring the cliched components of a secret military train getting derailed, I had expected this film to veer toward being about an ET-like creature, where ET was misunderstood by scientists but was a caring creature deep down that only a child could understand.  This alien, however, doesn't seem to value human life and showed no restraint in lashing out with unsympathetic violence (aside from a random scientist it decided to bond with early in the film).  Some may argue that this is a more realistic or simply different portrayal, which is better since Abrams most likely didn't want to remake ET.  However, I felt that it took away from the warmness that the film could have offered and made it more gritty as it got to the end.  Aside from that, I'm not a fan of movies where suspending disbelief is overly necessary, but this film absolutely requires it.  From the overly dramatic train wreck scene to the battle where kids are running around unchallenged by the plethora of soldiers, I found myself sighing with disappointment.  That and, despite being called "Super 8", the kids' film really doesn't play as big of a role as I would have thought.  In fact, in the last third, it is virtually nonexistent.<br /><br />It was a nice attempt to create a unique film and I will not deny that the basic premise, acting, and camerawork are fantastic.  However, I just didn't feel the *magic* that many critics said this film had.

review/summary: IT WAS JUST OK FLICK .. BUT FORGETABEL AFTER SHORT WHILE!!
review/text: Super 8 is much better when it delivers a coming of age story/drama, character developement and tearjerker than when it delivers the sci-fi/action & adventure elements to the film. The acting was very impressive in this film from all of the mostly unknown child actors with Elle Fanning in her best role to date next to Phoebe In Wonderland and it's amazing to me that this thirteen year old graces the screen effortlessly like she is a verteran actress, it's uncanny. The story of forgiveness and letting go overpowers most of the action scenes especially the ending which may bring some viewers to tears and the natural bond between the kids reminded me of classic films like Stand By Me and The Goonies with a dash of Signs, Monsters and E.T. and is mostly like those films than being a full blown thrilling and terrifying sci-fi/action flick and to be honest this is just a retro family film than what trailers lead you to believe. There were a couple of plot holes that bothered me like where did all the missing dogs go? How did the monster get there in the first place and are there more? Was is just a mad science experiment gone wrong? Ect. When it actually shows the monster it wasn't scary enough and went the King Kong route and made it have feelings which was a tad cheesy and what I'm trying to say is that it didn't go horror enough with not enough terror and suspense for a monster movie or whatever it was aiming for which I still don't know because it tried to juggle a bunch of genres at once which in the end kind of played against it and became less effective as it moves along. I liked how it was paying tribute to all of the classic movies of it's kind of that decade but mabey a little too much because alll it does is make you rememeber the good old days of the movies that you longed for that it tries so hard to become that it doesn't focus enough on becoming it's own movie which sooner or later will be forgotten.

review/summary: Good movie, big BUT...
review/text: I would seriously like to slap the snot out of whoever did the sound on this film. We rented this from Amazon. We have a home theatre system. The quiet conversations interspersed with frequent DEAFENING crashes, explosions, screams, etc. make it nearly unwatchable! I rode the remote the ENTIRE time, which is absolutely no fun, and my upstairs neighbors actually stomped on their livingroom floor at least 3 times because some of the scenes were so suddenly loud I couldn't possibly keep the volume at one steady level and still hear what the actors were saying.<br /><br />Why do filmmakers do this? It's obnoxious. And this film is one of the worst offenders. I guess if we'd gone to see this in a theatre, we'd have come home with blood streaming from our ears. I'd really like to watch it again because the cast was uniformly great and the story attention-grabbing -- but I won't, because of this one issue. Had it not been a streaming rental and a DVD instead, I might have watched it again -- with English captioning and NO sound.

review/text: J.J. Abrams, "Super 8" unabashedly draws on Spielberg films such as "E.T", "Close Encounters of the the Third Kind" and even a little of his version of the "War of the Worlds."  The story is pretty contrived and the ending very predictable.  It's obvious how it's going to turn out after about 45 minutes, especially with a bunch of kids leading the cast.  Given that the film is presumed to be set in the late 70s, I'm pretty sure the use of "totally" as an affirmative had not yet entered teen-speak by that time, at least in Ohio.  L.A., maybe --  Ohio, never.

Too bad that between the two of them they couldn't think of anything original to do.  On the upside, lots of noisy things blow up.  It is not bad American cinema; in fact, it's quite good, in the same way that a Big Mac is good American cuisine.

review/text: Super8 is an unabashed mix of some John Carpenter, 80s Spielberg and and the pilot of LOST.  Now each of those things in its own right can be inspired, but somehow all of them together don't move past the feeling this is an extended episode of a cable TV show.<br /><br />I'm not going to point in too many directions to spoil the film, but J.J. Abrahms pulls the Shyamalan card too and tries to lead us with bread crumbs into something surprising.  There are no surprises.  The movie would have been better served sticking to the core of friends out to make a movie instead of going to the recycle bin.  The friends making a movie part actually rings true from the heart, but it quickly goes down the chase movie route and the bulk is been there done that 30 years ago and then some.<br /><br />Is that to say the movie is not worth your time?  Heck no.  Super 8 is not surprising, nor original, but the movie is entertaining.  Buy?  Nope.  Rent?  Heck yeah.

Night Shyamalan's works) and the next moment I was screaming and giggling at the same time.  Brilliant supporting actors.  The kids were a dream.  Especially the little pyromaniac!  Too funny.  It was also a nostalgic movie, reminding me strongly of "Stand By Me" and "Goonies".  It was great watching kids actually getting out and having an adventure.  No wonder they had to set it in the past!<br /><br />Anyway---I loved it.  Can't wait to see it again and I will definitely be buying this one for my personal collection!

review/summary: Made me love going to the movies again!
review/text: The film is about basically about an alien (and military knowledge of it) and the small-town heroes who want to solve the mystery and save the town (and ultimately the alien, too.) Sort of a mixture of Gremlins, ET, Jurassic Park (lots of Spielberg-style in this movie), the Goonies, Predator, with a little zombie stuff and Dazed and Confused thrown in. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it is very tension driven, not gory (which worked well for the hard-to-please tweens in my house...not kiddies, but not ready for R-ratings.)<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more of the character development between the boys (even if the action sequences were a little shorter) but that is just my preference and that doesn't fit with the "summer blockbuster" type of genre. Still, it seemed to ride the buddy movie/action movie line very very well. I WANTED the protagonists to win...which doesn't always happen for me in some movies. There were also a few little moments of that-doesn't-make-any-sense and corny stuff, but the movie was so enjoyable, you just let the few go.<br /><br />Overall, it was quite good. I remember walking out and thinking "I wanna see that AGAIN!" which isn't a frequent response I have to most movies. I often judge movies by the amount of popcorn I have left...if it is gone, it means I was kind of bored/not engaged, but I had half a bag left after this one!! Be sure to stay during the credits to see the Super 8 version of "The Case."<br /><br />I hope people are reading these reviews before the DVD is released, because this one really should be seen on the big screen. It has a nostalgic feel and being in the theater (or better...the Drive-in!) really makes the experience more whole. A dark room at home with lots of popcorn will likely work well, too. I WILL find out because I have to own this!

How did the Air Force got the Alien? There is only one shot that you can see more clearly the face of the alien - but it was dark. The communication and inter action between the Alien and human are just not enough in this movie. The movie end quickly without explaining too much.

review/summary: Good as the hype?
review/text: Super 8(released June/11)gives us the one two punch of Steven Spielberg and Hollywood's flavour of the moment,J.J.Abrams.The hype would certainly lead one to believe this is an instant classic,a truly unforgettable cinematic experience,a movie you will see again and again,et al.Well,if you've been around movies along as I have,the hype becomes just that,alot of words/hot air to inflate something up,that may or may not have a pay day in the end.And the hype today is pretty much the same stuff they've been dishing out since the 20s.Does Super 8 have a long half life?Let's see.<br />The plot gives us a group of kids who love to make movies.Each character has their own raison d'etre,as Spielberg and company make each a stand out in their own right,translation:makes them like us ordinary folks.One is a wanna be movie director with a weight problem,one loves to play with matches and explosives,one likes to act but can't,one has a cop for a father and whose mother just passed away,and into this mix is thrown a young girl whose father doesn't get along with the aforesaid cop.<br />One evening finds the group out at a railroad station filming.A train approaches which will make a fine backdrop for their scene,but something startling will happen.One of them notices a pick up come onto the tracks ahead of the train and deliberately run into it.This causes the train to derail,but the train cars start flying through the air like footballs.By now they have abandoned their camera which has fallen sideways onto the platform but continues to film.In the aftermath they look around at the devastation not believing what just happened,let alone the fact they are all still alive.Suddenly the military approach-ith and the kids ski-doo.<br />The kids have all agreed not to discuss their experience,as the military has the crash scene sewn up.Slowly but surely strange things are a-happening.Dogs,people and equipment are disappearing in the town at an alarming rate,with no apparent explanation.One evening the girl of the group gets snatched up and taken away by a large creature.The boys stumble onto some notes a school professor had accrued over a long period of time,which has a direct bearing on what is happening now.The military interrupts their gathering and takes them all by bus back for interrogation.Along the way the creature attacks and tips the bus over.It kills the military men,but the kids escape.<br /><br />In the meantime the military has set a deliberate fire which threatens to engulf the entire town.They evacuate its citizens so they can go on the hunt and recapture this alien.It seems they captured it and its' spaceship years before,but the alien has wanted to go home ever since,and now that it is free this is what it intends to do.The remainders of the group drive back to town in an attempt at rescuing the girl,who has been taken down to an underground cavern.Underground,they indeed find the girl and return to the surface.They are just in time to witness the water tower turn into a giant magnet,drawing objects big and small onto it.The creature goes inside the tower,which immediately converts into an alien craft and away he/she/it goes.<br />Does this film live up to its 'classic' hype?.....not by a million light years.I found this film to be quite a boring time,frankly.The only thing classic about this film are the Spielberg touches,such as the attention to detail in the characterizations I mentioned earlier,getting the experiences of youth/young love,etc.from their perspective,feeling the ultimate empathy for the alien,one man,er boy,standing bravely up to and connecting with said alien,and finally no Spielberg picture would be complete without a resolution of the parent/child conflict at the beginning of the film,at the end,coupled with a tender reunion to enhance it all.Ahhhh.Trouble is,by the time this film wraps up I couldn't have cared less who made up with who or that the creature made it safely away,or any of the touchy feely moments Spielberg tried to engender.And speaking of the wrap up,I was actually surprised the ending,WAS the ending.I was expecting more footage of...I don't know what....anything,I guess.The film also takes its sweet time meandering its way through its somewhat cumbersome plot,introducing us all to its characters and locations which must engender within us that"Oh yeah,I remember that time",or the old chestnut"Hey Bob,I used to have a house and car just like that".Yep,that's a Spielberg moment,if ever there was one.Except,this is NOT E.T.,and I mean that in the sense that it doesn't come anywhere close to the quality of that film.And you know while we're on the subject and have Mr Spielberg's attention(he always reads my reviews!),I have just about had it with the portrayal of kids of that age who would NEVER in a million years have talked to each other,let alone their parents,in the fashion they do,without dying a million deaths.He can get the clothes right,the music down pretty good but the precociousness that most of his young characters exhibit,has just got to go,OK Steven?<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its w/s format.There is commentary and two featurettes on the making of the film.<br />All in all a HUGE disappointment.I try not to let the hype into my reviews and/or influence me in any way.In fact I find the more I know,the more skeptical I am about what is to come.I get to a point and become a Missourian..."Show Me".The hype couldn't save this stinker.The pace and the meandering script are way off the beam and all the tricks Spielberg can muster cannot even save the day here.It's another War of the Worlds(2005).Give it a pass.2 1/2-3 stars.

review/summary: Absolute total disappointment (some "spoilers")
review/text: Initially, I was going to just buy this, but I saw it at Redbox the other day and decided to rent it instead.  There's $1.20 absolutely wasted.<br /><br />I had relatively high expectations of this movie.  With Abrams and Spielberg working collaboratively, I figured it would have to be good in some ways.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I don't know if it could have been more hokey, cheesy, or cliche if they tried.  Poor sullen kid loses mom, and dad has to finally be a parent (ooh. gripping.).  The drunk neighbor is ridiculous.  Ooh.  Again.  "Stay away from my daughter".  Lame.  Then we have the sad alien who only wants to return home (ET, but more angry and on steroids?).  Amazingly, everyone comes away from a full on-train derailment with barely a scratch.  The person who DRIVES A TRUCK HEAD ON into it miraculously lived long enough to be killed by the USAF.<br /><br />Lovely.<br /><br />Stupid 'tween puppy love? Check.<br />Ridiculous story line?  Check.<br />Utterly predictable ending?  Check.<br />1 hour and 50 some minutes of my life I'll never get back?  Check.<br /><br />Those who rave must have seen another movie or are just blinded by the names attached to this movie.  Bottom line:  It was awful.

review/summary: Mediocre 8
review/text: I really wanted to like SUPER 8, and there are certainly elements to like. But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...<br /><br />What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich&eacute;, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clich&eacute;d but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.<br /><br />When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J. Abram's name, too, and I was hopeful. Alas, it was not to be. I have to think there were some mighty internal fights over the direction this movie should take. And in the end, I think the audience was the loser. I would have loved to see more of the small-town charm, more of the kids (quieter and with more believable dialog) and less of the angst and brutal mother-crushing.

review/summary: NOT Speilberg's best work at all!!
review/text: When I first saw the trailers for this I was instantly drawn in. The moment I found out that SPEILBERG had done this movie, I knew it was a MUST SEE. After waiting almost a year to see this train wreck of a movie, I was VERY dissappointed. The movie dragged throughout and there was no , EDGE OF YOUR SEAT type moments, we all just sat there waiting for ANYTHING.<br /><br />The timeframe of the movie was perfect and the cinematography was excellent, but the story line was weak and lacking. This movie came to theaters the day I got married and I am so glad we did not go see this. I want the $5 back I paid to see this. This movie could have been a BLOCKBUSTER, but it is honestly just horrible. Speilberg is losing his touch and he should never work with JJ Abrams ever again!

review/summary: Beautiful and stirring, but surprisingly mechanical and eventually empty....
review/text: "Super 8" is to late 70s/early 80s Steven Spielberg fare what the Black Crowes are to Altamont-era Rolling Stones, or what the first Lenny Kravitz album is to "Magical Mystery Tour"-era Beatles.<br /><br />Which is to say, hugely influenced by it.<br /><br />But when a movie owes as much as "Super 8" does to other artistic creations ... can it really be considered its own thing?<br /><br />Critics were saying that after "Mission: Impossible III" and the recently rebooted "Star Trek" movie, J.J. Abrams was finally attempting something that wasn't a remake. But both "M:I3" and "Star Trek" took something old and made it wildly new (I'm an enthusiastic fan of both of those films), while "Super 8" is so entirely beholden to "Jaws," "Close Encounters...," "The Goonies," "Gremlins" and "Amazing Stories" that it feels like a big step backward for Abrams.<br /><br />The child actors are superb, the story has weight and the look is beautiful and stirring ... but the movie so busy spinning plates and hurling curveballs that I doubt I'll watch again. On the other hand, I rarely tire of vintage Spielberg.

review/summary: Let's make a hit, says JJ Abrams. So much for making a good movie.
review/text: JJ Abrams has made hit movies. Has he ever made a good movie? With Super 8, he wrote, directed and produced two movies, and sacrificed the good to make sure he had a hit.<br /><br />Super 8 begins just fine, the story of a group of young teens making a movie about zombies. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is determined to enter his movie in a film contest. He's the director and writer. Joe (Joel Courtney) is his best friend and make-up specialist.  When Charles recruits Alice (Elle Fanning) for a role (she can drive and they need a car), Joe starts to learn what puberty can do to a fella.<br /><br />We're off on a small town adventure of stealth movie making, improvisation, determination, spontaneity and, as far as I know, effective zombie acting. One night when the kids have sneaked away from their homes to film a night scene at the railway station, Charles sees a train coming. "Production values!" he happily exclaims and sets up the scene so the train roaring by will be in his movie. Bad luck. A truck drives onto the tracks and smashes head on into the train. There's a massive derailment only Hollywood CGI can create. It goes on and on.<br /><br />Now the young moviemakers are center stage in a new movie, this one about an alien creature captured by the Air Force and in the charge of a particularly ruthless colonel and his men. This movie is made to insure a hit with that real-life demographic, the 16 through 28 crowd. Yes, in the crash the alien, which looks something like a quick-stepping giant tarantula crossbred with the real mama from hell in Alien, escapes. Thanks to a couple of film cartons the kids dropped as they ran from the crash, the colonel figures out someone might have seen too much and filmed it. Soon dogs run away from town, engines from cars are stolen, electronic gear disappears and people vanish, all in clouds of wowzer and predictable special effects.<br /><br />In the course of Super 8 we'll follow young Joe through adventures that now are by the numbers...evacuations, tanks, house explosions, great caverns, missing townspeople including Alice hanging upside down waiting to become alien snacks, Joe's face-to-face heroism with the big bug, and one of the most non-thrilling examples of spaceship building in any movie. Although the alien looks like something really big that escaped from an insect zoo, it turns out that, despite its chomping down on people with slobber and lots of teeth, it's really just a guy (or woman) who is scared and lonely, who has been treated badly by the Air Force, and just wants to build a spaceship so it can go home.<br /><br />JJ Abrams creates a warm, nostalgic story about kids back in the Seventies who are energetically making a movie while keeping it secret from adults. The kid actors do a fine, believable job and we like them. Their small town is a great place to live in. Charles' family is a wonderful mix of love and chaos. We're hooked with these kids and with Charles' movie. And all this just becomes loose ends. (We do get to see Charles' movie during the credits...like an afterthought.<br /><br />In his determination to win a big audience, Abrams sacrifices all that in favor of by-the-numbers demographic pandering and CGI. Abrams worked for Steven Spielberg for a while and Spielberg is a producer of Super 8. Spielberg's influence is all over the movie. If you liked The Goonies, which I do, you'll like a third of Super 8, a movie with no center, just calculation.

review/summary: One of the best of 2011!
review/text: Sometimes, you go to see a film and it doesn't leave much of an impression on you. Sometimes it's quite the opposite and you're left to thinking about the film and the story over and over again. "Super 8" - wunderkind director J.J. Abrams' third feature film (as a director) - is definitely slotted in the latter category! When I first viewed the movie trailer, I instantly thought of Steven Spielberg (who produced the film) meets Stephen King - in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164GDA0">Stand by Me (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] (published as "The Body" in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451167538">Different Seasons (Signet)</a>), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169514">It</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671024248">Hearts In Atlantis</a> (specifically "Low Men in Yellow Coats"). After seeing the film, my hunch was correct. If you are a fan of Spielberg's early blockbusters like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2IPP0">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECACG">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], or King's previously mentioned books, then this is the film to go see!<br /><br />What amazed me so much about the story were the characters; they are so likeable and relatable that it makes it easy for the viewer to take these people to heart. The kid actors are all effective and talented, however their characters still don't quite reach <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KQVDH8">The Goonies [Blu-ray</a>] status. Nevertheless, they are realistic and fun - especially the lead, Joe (Joel Courtney), Alice (Elle Fanning), and Charles (Riley Griffiths). Now, let me take a moment here to completely and shamelessly praise actress Elle Fanning. Big sister Dakota Fanning better watch her back because Elle's performance in this is phenomenal! She encapsulates both a boy's first crush as well as that cool, beautiful girl you knew in school, all in one - the kind of girl who talks and you just fall in love with her. Plus, she brings exceptional emotional depth to her character and the film; just watch the scene between Alice and Joe when they are watching film footage of Joe's dead mother - a raw, stirring scene. The heartrending bond that she and Joe have in the film helps the story along to prove that this is more than just some monster flick. As I grow older, I find that my most favorite films are the ones that explore the intricacies of peoples' connectivity and relationships to one another. For all of its special effects and monster hijinks (like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>], Abrams borrows from Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)</a> in not showing too much of the monster), "Super 8" focuses on relationships; and it is not in some hokey way, but in a way that imbues the film with a kind of magic. It's that same magic that you feel when you're a kid and the simplest things in life are what matter most - that magic of innocence, growing up, first love, exploring the world, and standing for what you believe in.<br /><br />Most of Spielberg's movies have "daddy issues" where the father of the main character(s) is either dead or has left, and Abrams slightly shifts this theme with having the daddy made a widow (the always-likeable Kyle Chandler) who is estranged from his son Joe and has issues with the town drunk, also Alice's dad (Ron Eldard). Add in Joe's crush on Alice plus his growing friendship with the other boys (especially his friend, Charles), and there's a well-balanced summer blockbuster. This is not one of those "deep meaning" movies either; people die ... violently, things blow up (a lot). Considering the other summer releases this year, I believe I'm safe in saying that "Super 8" is the summer movie of the year! There is something about this film that makes you want it to last a little longer, but it's good it did not because then it would risk being too overdone. It is not the story that you want to last so much as it is a peek into the journey of these characters' lives.<br /><br />An aspect I really despise as a critic is writing (or telling people) about how good a film is and then those people going in with such high expectations and when I ask them how it was, they say, "It sucked," or, "It was OK, but I didn't see why you thought it was so great." I know what I say is going to set the bar high for most audiences out there, and they might not like it. It doesn't matter. No matter what you say as a critic, you stand by your claim; my claim is that this is one of the best movies of the year. And with "Super 8," the proof is in the story, the direction and the acting.

review/summary: Coke, Popcorn, and a Classic Movie
review/text: I wont bother with spoilers or a long winded written version of the movie, the trailers are good enough to get an idea of what the movie is about.  Instead I will simply say that this movie is a classic and will be considered so for the remainder of film watching history.  I watched a preview of it recently on Time Warner Cable where the announcer said, "Reminds us why we go to the movies," and I cant express how true that statement is.  Though there are mixed reviews on this movie it is important to remember that these are kids taking the place of the main characters in this film and that is no easy task.  Regardless the characters are well drawn and each of them hilarious in their own right.<br />Aside from the awesome characters and wonderful story there are more technical reasons that make this movie great.  J.J. Abrams' ability to use color and a wide angled shots are abilities that are unrivaled in today's film making community.  When watching this movie look at his amazing ability to use the color blue.  He also seems to have an affinity for the Mid-West and that classic American lifestyle from the sixties and seventies.  His ability to showcase and romanticize that lifestyle is also unrivaled.<br />Like "Star Trek" J.J. Abrams has showcased his ability to rejuvenate what made the original so good, and while this movie is no remake it almost feels like an homage to "The Goonies."  What made that classic film so fun and memorable are what drive this movie to its five star rating.  This is simply my opinion but I urge anyone looking to have a fun movie night to watch this movie.  It is both fulfilling and exciting.

THIS VERY WELL MADE SCI-FI CRAFTED FLICK HAD (LIKE "HUGO"), KIDS, ALL UNDER 16 AS THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND ADULTS IN THE SUPPORTING ROLES. STARRING ELLE FANNING (DAKOTA'S SISTER) IN A REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE THAT WILL GET HER NOTICED FOR MORE PARTS IN FILMS TO COME! NEWCOMERS ALSO IN THE ENSEMBLE ARE VERY BELIEVABLE AND WILL GET ATTENTION FOR FUTURE PROJECTS. THE STORY, PACE, EDITING AND SPECIAL EFFECTS (THE BEST TRAIN WRECK ON FILM!!) ARE OUTSTANDING AND SPIELBERG HAD INFLUENCE ON AND OFF THE SET. IF ABRAMS CREDIT WERE NOT ON SCREEN, SPIELBERG WOULD HAVE HIS TRADEMARK ALL OVER THIS. EXCELLENT MUSIC AS WELL! AND THE 'ALIEN BEING' IS AS MUCH A MAJOR CHARACTER AS THE HUMANS, BUT NOT A CUTZY 'E.T.' THIS FILM WITHIN A FILM, TAKES PLACE IN THE MID-1970'S AND THE LOCATIONS, SETS AND PERIOD PROPS DO THEIR JOB TO TAKE YOU ACCURATELY BACK IN THAT TIME 'FRAME'. SEE THIS! AND SEE ALL THREE!!!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 'HUGO' AND 'THE ARTIST' TOO!!!<br /><br />SADLY, AS USUAL, THE MAKERS ON THE DVD DO NOT INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF 'EXTRAS' AND 'FEATURETTES' AS DOES THE BLU-RAY COPIES. I DO NOT OWN A BLU-RAY PLAYER AND THIS 'ATTITUDE' FROM THE MANUFACTURERS JUST PISSES ME OFF MORE AND MORE!!<br /><br />  . . .  FRED K. WILLDERS

It's also NOT a kid's movie, full of hyperactive and desensitizing violence, gore, and pandering.  Fanning was refreshing, but the other characters frankly sucked.<br /><br />I just finished the whole X-Files series from my local library.  This seemed like a very bad X-Files, dumbed down for kids.  Not to mention ET, Close Encounters, and almost every other Spielbergian flick ever made.<br /><br />Steve . . . give it a rest.

review/summary: Sort of ET meets Close Encounters meets ALIEN
review/text: Even though this film was written and directed by J.J. Abrahms, the film oozes with Spielberg-ness. The film centers around a group of kids who have much more insight and wisdom than the adults, much like ET. The military branch of the US Government moves in, trying to hide whats really happening, much like Close Encounter of the Third Kind. And there's a large hulking space creature that I guess is not quite as malicious as the creature from Alien but he's tearing up a small town. As you'll see, some of the creature's victims are treated similarly to Alien.<br /><br />The film involves a group of kids of junior high school age in 1979 shooting their own zombie-horror flick; one of whom has just lost his mother. The director Charles (played very convincingly by the young and talented Riley Griffiths), a sort of 12-year-old throwback to Orson Welles, replete with pipe, is the obsessed and ambition filmmaker doing everything he can to make a great film. He is constantly speaking of "production value". My guess is his character may have been somewhat based on the young Steven Spielberg who pressed his friends into little film projects shot with his super-8 camera back in the 1950's. The two other characters which emerge as the main focus are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) two people thrust together because of their involvement with the film project who become somewhat intimate in a way that only 12-year-old's can. A supporting character of note has to be Cary, played by Ryan Lee, who carries around fire crackers just to make the older folk cringe.<br /><br />The group is shooting a scene at a train station with the boy main character and the only girl in the movie. Their production literally becomes derailed by a train wreck which obliterates everything in sight, not to mention the station, although the super-8 camera which continued to film was surprisingly untouched! Of course, this is not just a train derailment: the whole train looks like it was in the middle of the front lines in WWII. A man in a busted up pick-up, looking half-dead, who may have intentionally derailed the train, tells the kids to run for their lives. The kids escape in their car, which was also surprisingly untouched, before the military guys show up with flash-lights and guns.<br /><br />The story then moves on several fronts: the mystery of the train wreck, Charles' obsession with completing his movie, and the relationship between Joe and Alice and their parents. Eventually, when more of the mystery is revealed, the film becomes largely about a kind of reconciliation between the two kids and their parents. At a certain point, the movie-making aspect takes a back seat to the relationships of the two kids and the two adults. It seemed like Charles, the director, at one point, seems more like a supporting character.<br /><br />Although I definitely enjoyed this film, largely because of the believability of the kids which is first-rate by any standard, I was frustrated on a couple of points. I thought the movie was trying to do too many things given its parameters. To me, the relationship between the two main kid characters and their parents distracted away from the really interesting idea about the kids trying to make their movie. Also, I thought there would be a lot more about the footage which was gotten at the train wreck.<br /><br />The one character who I felt was slightly under-developed was Charles, the kid director. His screen time was sacrificed in order to develop more about the adult relationships, which I found less interesting, some of which seemed just a touch clich&eacute;. I wanted to know more about Charles, why he was shooting his films and other information. Only late in the film do we learn more about him and why he was engaging in this project.<br /><br />Two stories which are very similar to this film, Spielberg's ET and Stephen King's IT, focus almost exclusively on the kids, who they are, and what they are trying to accomplish. If a story begins about a group of kids, I think it is better for the story to stay on them rather getting off on tangents. Super-8 started out that way, but then took a bit of a side turn and focused more on a couple of the adult characters. I was sort of expecting the kids to be on the lead and in the forefront for most of the story, and I wanted them to be the ones who solve the mystery without intervention from dear-old dad. Still, a very enjoyable movie, and the acting is first-rate to take you all the way. One surprise is at the end during the credits, which was actually my favorite part of the film, but I won't give it away!

review/text: Well, I took a chance on it and my instincts were right. This is Spielberg trying so hard to get the freshness of ET and the creativity of "Amazing Stories" . It's a mish-mosh combination that goes off the rails.<br /><br />The film actually starts off producing mild interest for the first twenty five minutes. Some annoying half teen/half something else kids of 1979 suburbia are working on making a home style movie. That's about the only part that held my interest because I had done the same as a youngster, but after the big train wreck, this monstrosity goes on and on with noise and nonsense. The kids get caught up in some military generated creature bs (or restrained alien- who knows) that plays out like a far fetched kiddie film. Most movies generate improbability, but this film throws in the kitchen sink and more as it scrambles for high octane interest.<br /><br />The creature is so wicked and destructive that no one in their right mind, let alone a kid, would want to come near the thing. The CGI seems old school and detracts as the monster who is wisely hidden with glimpses reveals itself. Of course one pre- teen boy can stop this fiend in it's tracks with vocal civility. Sub plots including a weirdly displayed kid crush and conflicting dads fall flat all around. Remove the sci -fi aspect and you have big screen Hallmark movie. A concoction of metal, lights and crud is whipped up to create an excuse of an ending. It couldn't come fast enough for this dud.

review/summary: A boring re-make of E.T., wasted my time and money.
review/text: No wonder the trailer was extremely vague, they had to spark SOME interest and trick people into watching this film. And everyone would have just thought, 'oh, an E.T. remake'. Some Remakes can be tweaked and great, but this movie was horrible. The expectations were high considering the producer and director. What a let down. The story line was just like in E.T., the only thing different was E.T. was like E.T. on meth and steroids. Catch this film if it's available on redbox for $1 or when it plays on tv, but definitely not worth the $3.99 and anticipation. If you hate movies that are really quiet when you need to hear what is being said, then obnoxiously and unnecessarily loud, definitely avoid this one. The cinematography was also horrible.<br />Really hated this film and I love Sci-Fi. What a disappointment.

review/summary: Dull
review/text: Too scary for young kids, and too boring for older kids, Super 8 is selling only one thing, really...nostalgia.  However, the movie tries so hard to invoke the look and feel of those films from the late 70's, early 80's that those who grew up back then remember so fondly, it forgets to be a good movie in its own right.  The sentiment is all cheap, the plot is all recycled, the action is all generic, and as good as the child actors are, they're still child actors.  I heard so many people say they liked this movie without offering up even the vaguest of specifics as to why, and now that I've seen it, I think I know: even if you fall to its nostalgic charms, you won't remember a bit of this eminently forgettable movie in a few days; you'll remember the movies it's trying to remind you off.<br /><br />Rent before you buy.

review/summary: Not a "feel good" movie
review/text: The school year is ending, which means less homework and more opportunities to go to the movies on weekdays.  My daughters wanted to see "Super 8" because my youngest had heard from a friend in school that one scene made her scream aloud.  I myself was not sure what to make of a film touted as an "homage" to another producer/director.  But JJ Adams has made some very solid movies in my opinion, so it couldn't be all bad.  And it wasn't.  My daughters were duly frightened and pronounced it a very good movie.  But I found myself thinking about the plot during those moments when the pace of the movie seemed to slow.  First thought that hit me was these events were taking place when Jimmy Carter was president.  He never seemed like the type of chief executive that would have approved of secret and not so nice air force programs to exploit captive aliens.  Then I began wondering why a lowly colonel ran the whole program and why he had been in charge for apparently a number of years.  And then I wondered why heavily armed national guardsmen wearing flak jackets were evacuating a town threatened by a wildfire.  Seemed a bit like overkill if you asked me?  The sight of those guys on the street would have led to me START asking questions rather than blindly following their directions.  Plus, fuel trucks don't blow up if you shoot them with a rifle (see the Mythbusters series).  Well, I guess it doesn't pay to look for holes in a plot because undoubtedly they exist in all movies.  But then again, if the film had engaged me throughout, I guess I would not have had the time to mull over the plot.  The acting on the part of the kids was excellent - Elle Fanning especially.  Some aspects of the film - like the kids making a zombie movie - were also brilliant.  The casting for the adults, however, seemed a bit stereotypical.  The bad Air Force colonel had to look bad, etc. I felt like I had to explain the concept of posse comitatus to my kids when I got home. I also have trouble comparing the monster to ET when I learned that it apparently ate people.  Seemed a bit more CLOVERFIELD-ish and thus much less sympathetic.

review/text: We thought the acting was good.  The special effects especially during the train crash were enough to make you sit up straight in your seat. After the train crash, the movie got more and more incredible.  With the writer producer team of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg we really expected a movie in the ET class - it was NOT.  The thing that bothered me most is that depicting the US military as the villain is a movie ploy that is shabby and has gotten threadbare with repeated use.  We just expected better.

review/text: In a world where there is really very little that is new or refreshing, this turkey fits right in.  If you love obviously miniaturized train crashes where a guy driving an old beat-up pickup truck can survive a head-on crash with a fast-moving freight train, and totally derail it in the process.  If you can accept that premise, silly, overused plot-concept, poor character development and CGI from 15 or 20 years ago, this is your movie.  Big mistake for me!<br /><br />Since I seem to have not learned anything from this drivel, I just rented Cowboys and Aliens.  I wonder how that review will go?  But then, I continue to watch Sons of Anarchy.  Sometimes I wonder if I stuck my head in a Mix-master as a child?

review/summary: Goonies vs the Broken-Hearted Cannibal Alien
review/text: The preview in the theatre had me at the edge of my seat.  I couldn't wait for Super 8 to become available.  Finally!  I rented with the expectation I'd be purchasing it immediately after.  I was considering writing to Amazon about allowing the rental to be applied credit to a purchase if the customer decides the video is worth adding to his/her video library.  Good idea, right?<br />  I was disappointed that I never got a good look at the alien, although I've got to say that train wreck was super-spectacular! I couldn't believe none of those kids were 'gonners' and that the camera survived! I remembered clips of it in the previews and knew that this was the moment whatever it was in the car was escaping.  It was suspenseful with the first human snatching and humans screaming in terror.  After all that we ran out of salt.<br />  As I was watching the kids making decisions and going through their kid drama, i kept thinking it reminded me of something; this plot is familiar. Before the film was over, I realized it's Goonies revisited.  An alien is taking people and they're arguing about girls.  The girl gets taken so a plan is concocted to save her. We find snatched humans strung upside down in the alien cave, find out they are sustenance for the alien, get to hear him chomp on one, learn he just wants to go home, one of the kids gets caught by the alien but has a mind connection so the alien doesn't eat him.  Anyway, it works out that the alien 's ship pulls itself together and he leaves.  Oh, don't let me forget it's a sadistic military that's holding the alien hostage in the first place.<br /><br />  Well, that's the nutshell version.  A bit of a letdown for me but I think my rental applied to purchase idea's a good one.

review/summary: I never feel compelled to write a review, but...
review/text: This movie was a breath of fresh air.  I saw all the comparisons to E.T. before viewing this film and being 25, E.T. was one of my favorite movies as a kid, but I was honestly desperately hoping they could do an alien film with kids without trying to pull needless tears out of me.  I just didn't want that type of emotional ride.<br /><br />That being said, let me say this movie is NOTHING like E.T.  We all know E.T. is about children who *befriend* an alien and he parts at the end and we're all just devastated.  That is not the case here at all.  The only remote similarity to E.T. this movie holds is the "style" in which it is shot, but if we are judging by "style," we can also say at some points this movie is comparable to The Goonies.  The hairstyles, clothing, cars, etc have a very 80s feel to them, but the year is very ambiguous.  It could be taking place in present day, it could be in 1982, it could be anytime.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi fan, you will absolutely love this movie. If you are nostalgic for "the way movies used to be made," you will LOVE this movie.  As soon as the credits begin to roll, I was already ready to watch the movie again because I just couldn't get enough.  Although, they could have carried the story a little further, it really wasn't necessary.  So, if you choose not to read any further, just know this movie is definitely the best film that has came out this year and totally worth all the hype.  Thank you for reading.<br /><br />***STOP HERE, MAY SPOIL***<br /><br />My only difficulty during the movie was Elle Fanning's character and the one boy's creepy crush on her that goes undiscussed for quite a while.  Her character is sort of clueless and really seems to have no place other than to be the one girl and to take part in the film the kids are making. I found myself, at times, kind of wishing she was not there.  Her dad is depicted as a a-hole and we are not supposed to like him, but I found myself agreeing with him *just* because the boy had not really stated his purpose and was kinda "hanging around" just waiting on her to profess her undying love for him.  However!  I must say there's eventually a conversation and it was not really addressed how I thought it would be, but they were able to relate to one another in a way we were not aware of until the scene takes place.  This redeems their relationship a little and makes it much easier to understand and to watch.  Whew!<br /><br />***DEFINITE SPOILERS***<br />Towards the end, I was pleasantly surprised to find the boy was willing to confront the alien face-to-face when I was *just* thinking, "Man, he should totally take on the alien himself instead of all of them running like idiots" and as soon as I thought it should happen, it did.  The lesson was completely gratifying.  The boy confronts his fear and verbalizes to the malevolent alien that "Bad things happen, but that doesn't mean you can't LIVE," which we know wasn't *just* about the alien situation currently taking place.  We learn about "letting go" and acceptance.  I was shocked they even thought to do this.  It could have easily taken the direction of a war movie with the kids having some kind of insight into the situation, but this, oh, it was so much better.  The movie knew what it wanted to be and completely stayed true to it the entire time.

review/summary: Horrible movie, filled with so many plot holes you could drive a train through it!
review/text: I had high hopes for this movie, but it was so filled with countless plot holes and so badly written, that the group of us watching were falling off our chairs by the end with laughter.  It played like a frantic fever dream, jumping from one non-nonsensical scene to another.  By the end, we were rooting for the army to destroy the evil alien who killed countless innocent people, destroyed a town, and left an entire community broken.  In the end, it flies away, powered by the locket that the main characters mother's gave him.  Who knew an intergalactic spaceship could be powered by schmaltz.<br /><br />There were many scenes that were introduced that did nothing to advance the story or deepen the understanding of the characters.  The mother's death by a steam beam did not impact the story or really the main character.  You really felt nothing for the child, because that emotional pain was not connected with the story.  The conflict with the father and the drunk man responsible for his wife's death was also meaningless.  Why spend a scene on that?<br /><br />Here are a couple of items for thought:<br /><br />1. The Air Force does not actually have any airplanes or helicopters.  Instead, the air force has to run to the scene of the train crash.<br /><br />2. Why did the alien have to dig all those tunnels when the entire town was built around a mine?<br /><br />3. What did the alien need with all those people that it was kidnapping?  Was it going to eat them?<br /><br />4. The townspeople had no knowledge of the alien.  If the alien had a physic connection with the people, why did it senselessly kill so many innocent people?  By the end, it was a blood bath!<br /><br />5. Why does the Air Force have so many tanks, and why were they randomly blowing up the town?  This is another example of where a scene was filmed and then had to be explained away to justify the inclusion of such scene.<br /><br />6. At the end, cars, tanks, bicycles (anything metallic) are all flying towards the ship.  Then, amazingly, here comes the dad driving in his Jeep which is totally unaffected.  Also unaffected was the child with all those METAL braces?  Why wasn't he pulled into the ship and killed?<br /><br />7. Why was the conflict over the girl suddenly introduced?  In came from nowhere.<br /><br />8. If keeping the alien's existence was so important, why did the Air Force allow the children to constantly film them?<br /><br />These are only a few points.  Unfortunately, the writing was so lazy that it ruined what could have been a good film.  I would NOT recommend this as a buy.

This 38 year old feel asleep in one part.  It's a pretty film, and the child actors are VERY good, but the story is sort-of lame, and the ending pretty much a let down.  Folks are rating this film highly because they WANT to like it, but own it's own merits, it's really kind of boring and too slow paced to really capture the magic of, say, ET or the GOONIES.  Meh.

review/summary: OK MOVIE...ANNOYING KIDS
review/text: Just finished watching Super 8. There was a really slow buildup to the action part of the movie. The train wreck was really good and the special effects were amazing. My big problem was with the kids. I am sure they will grow up and be really great actors. They were written really bad parts for this movie. Why was there so much cussing and bad language by the kids. If you want a family movie be aware that the kids have bad language, are rude and nasty to each other,sneak out of home after midnight, and(while underage) steal cars and drive them. The kids came of annoying and in desperate need of discipline. I hate to sound that way but these kids were behaving in bad ways. They are being a bad example to other kids. Kids today are out of control and movies like this show them that it is ok to act this way. While some adults may just laugh at the way these kids acted in this movie, kids today need to be taught proper ways to behave. I was horrified at how these kids were talking to each other and acting out in public. This would have been easier to take if the actors had been in their late teens, but these kids were around 12 years old. In the late 1970's parents would not have allowed their kids to talk this way to other people and to the parents. Trust me I grew up in a small town in Ohio, where this film is supposed to be set. If you want a movie to watch for family night and want to set a good example for your kids and don't want to have to constantly explain that people shouldn't talk like that or do that, don't watch this movie. 12 year old kids shouldn't be cussing, stealing cars, setting explosives, driving the stolen cars, sneaking out of the house at night, and back talking their parents. This is not cute or funny. It is sad. I am really disappointed that Steven Speilberg put his name on this film.

review/summary: Modernized Love Letter to 80s Adventure Flicks is Sometimes Too Indulgent
review/text: For better or for worse, this certainly wasn't what I was expecting. At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses. It's a fantastic popcorn muncher with a fascinating knack for the unpredictable, but much, much more shallow than anything else in the Abrams catalog. Fun for a single viewing, I doubt I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Alien meets Close Encounters, and definitely disappoints...
review/text: Am I the only one who thought this movie under-delivered, was over-hyped, and was unnecessarily bloated with foul language?<br /><br />I guess seeing Steven Spielberg's name conjured up in my mind a warm, climax-building, plot-developing Saturday afternoon kid-flick, with a memorable soundtrack, and a terrific ending that would make me walk out of the theater amazed, and with an 'how'd they do that?' admiration.<br /><br />For my matin&eacute;e money I got more foul language than memorable lines, an Alien-esque monster that I could develop neither sympathy nor hate for, and a not-so-epic conclusion that made me ask the question: 'who the heck cares?'<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot. It's the standard-fare government cover-up (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) of the presence of an alien creature we are supposed to both fear and pity. The thing wants to go home (ET but with none of the warmth), and does more stomping and smashing than anything else.<br /><br />The alien finally turns the water tower in Lillian, Ohio into a gigantic magnet which shape-shifts car engines, microwaves, a kid's locket and bikes into a spaceship. With the drama of a donut, the creature climbs aboard and goes home, and there you have it. End of Story.<br /><br />While the kid actors are wonderful, and Spielberg shows again he knows the ways of adolescents well, we don't get to know them as thoroughly as we might hope.<br /><br />Other than the loss of a mom, a pot-smoking dad, dysfunctional family relationships and the conflicts extant between most all parents and kids, there's not a lot else to make us love the little band of Super 8 filmmakers. They are creative to be sure, and we have the expected boy/girl crush thrown in, but other than the scene 'filmed' at the train crash, the kids are not memorable.<br /><br />Also left underdeveloped in plot and unanswered as questions are: why, specifically, is it the dogs who run away? Where is the alien from and why is it really here? Why does it store humans upside down in the hole (they seem to serve no purpose)? Was there a point at all to the lady with the curlers in her hair? Couldn't we develop more rapport between the alien and the kids?<br /><br />In short, the explosions and sparklers are nice, but nothing spectacular anymore. The period music is OK, and disco references, Walkman, and old Kodak cameras are nostalgic. But if you're looking for a fast-paced plot like Raiders, a spectacular conclusion like Close Encounters, or the charm and warmth of ET, you won't find it here. Just some foul-mouthed kids, an estranged alien with an attitude, and some explosions to keep you awake.<br /><br />If this movie is 'memorable', our standard for Saturday afternoon adventure has been significantly lowered. Disappointing.

What they soon realize is that something escaped from the train during the accident and the military will do anything to cover it up.<br />  Super 8 starts out exciting, becomes very slow in the middle and then is exciting again. So I never found the pacing to be too good, while the film also reminded me of way too many Spielberg movies, including E.T, War of Worlds, Close Encounters and Goonies "which he produced" among others. While the thing in it "and I won't give away what it is", isn't very original looking.<br />  I will say that the film at least works emotionally and that all of the young actors are very strong in their roles. The look of the film is also faithful to Spielberg which works since the film is basically a tribute to him. But they might as well have gave away more of the plot in the trailers since the movie really isn't too original.

review/summary: Extremely overrated
review/text: Super 8 is a sub-par Spielberg knock-off. A forced-homage to the glory days of blockbuster film-making. I'm a fan of JJ Abrams first two films (Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek)but this movie kind of left me cold. The story is boring and lacking any sort of emotional resonance. The design of the creature is uninspired, with unconvincing CGI, and not even remotely sympathetic. While all the kids are well-acted, their character's aren't really interesting, and many of them were downright annoying. The ending is silly, sentimental cheese at its worst. If you want to see the real thing, watch ET or Close Encounters instead.

review/summary: Tries hard to recapture an era, but just feels derivative
review/text: **1/2<br /><br />J.J. Abrams' "Super 8" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.<br /><br />Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - "Super 8" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.<br /><br />The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable "Friday Night Lights") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.<br /><br />The similarities between "Super 8" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, "E.T.") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like "E.T." into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an "E.T." and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. "Super 8" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game.<br /><br />In addition to "E.T.," there are bits and pieces of "The Goonies," "Stand By Me," "Gremlins," and "War of the Worlds" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with "Super 8." It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.

review/summary: Super 8 out of focus
review/text: First of all I've never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled to do so simply because of the number of 5 star reviews for this film. A person who's on the fence about purchasing this movie might be swayed simply by all of the reviews without renting it and I just had to offer an objective counterpoint after having finally seen the movie. People may genuinely like this movie, hey more power to them and this is just my opinion.<br /><br />I went into the movie pretty stoked because of the initial previews for it. I then read some of the professional reviews and they were pretty positive. So I knew going in that this was essentially a 2-hour love letter to all things Spielberg-ian, much less classic Spielberg when he could do no wrong, so I was even more psyched! And then I watched the film.<br /><br />The biggest two films that this movie borrows/steals heavily from are Close Encounters and E.T. And those two movies had one thing in common right off the bat - they hooked the audiences in. Immediately. Everyone's seen them so I won't rehash why their hooks worked. This film had no such hook - or at least not the hook you'd suspect in a movie heavily advertised as a summer action/sci-fi film. I knew something was off when they focused on the main character Joe, a roughly 15 year old kid, and then proceeded to drag out the opening. I was still psyched mind you, just less enthusiastic about the movie. And the opening was thoughtful and emotional but just not what I expected. I thought we were going to hit the ground running with the kids filming their Super 8 movie, establish quick backgrounds, and then the train derailment would hit and all hell would break loose. It didn't. We're introduced to Joe and all of his buddies and the I-couldn't-see-that-coming-1000-miles-away love interest and we eventually get to where the previews had me hyped. And then that crapped out.<br /><br />It seems that the movie's sideplot of Joe's relationship with his friends, potential girlfriend, and his father took up roughly 75% of the movie and the "other" plot with the alien was about 25%. Keep in mind these numbers are based on my first viewing and could be off, it's simply what it felt like to me as it unfolded. You get a quick scene with the alien and then back to the much longer friends scenes. Repeat that formula a few times and there's the movie. It just wasn't properly focused. You'd get the action going and then dial it all the way back down to zero.<br /><br />And then I was just amazed at the homage scenes to Spielberg. They were pretty blatant. The airforce guys who rush out of NOWHERE with flashlights at the derailment was a rip-off of E.T. as was a couple of city shots at dusk. All of the dysfunctional family scenes with Joe's buddy, the budding director, were completely ripped-off from Close Encounters as was a town evacuation scene. There was even a quick utility truck scene driving through the countryside that I would've sworn was from Close Encounters. In fact all of Joe's buddy's are simply knock-off versions of the kids in Stand By Me and, to a lesser extent, Goonies. And I won't ruin the ending but even a certain element of that basically copied E.T.<br /><br />And I won't even get into actual plot holes with the government agents and the biology teacher as that'd ruin the movie with potential spoilers because if you see it I'd rather you not know everything. But I will say this to all of the 5-star reviewers - after watching this did the kids in any way forward the plot with the alien? IMO they did not - events would've unfolded without them anyways except for one single rescue scene. The main character's(the kids) that were focused on in no way helped or hindered the alien plotline. We could've essentially replaced the kids with a group of rogue monkeys that escaped from a zoo and accidentally recorded the alien. Can't go wrong with monkeys for comedic relief.<br /><br />Anyways there you go. Sorry for the length of the review - I just wanted to explain why this just didn't work for me and warn you if you're expecting a whimsical, tightly knit action-filled sci-fi film you'll be in for a surprise as that's definitely not what this is. It's a tale of friendship and a coming of age story. With an alien. And that would be fine but it wasn't in any way promoted as such.<br /><br />Please rent this first before just blindly buying it. And to everyone who loves it, great. I'm not full of hate for this movie, just massive disappointment for what it could have been, based on the previews. My one star rating will be considered harsh as the acting overall was decent and the effects worked, but the overall stuttering plot just didn't do it for me. To me a 5-star film is pretty flawless with the storyline and plot, that's why I'm amazed at all of the 5-stars out there. You truly think this is a perfect film? A masterpiece? You'll return to this over and over again throughout the years like you would with a true, much less original, 5-star film?  I'll just stick with the far superior source material(s) instead of this.<br /><br />Peace

For Spielberg,why  did you  have to  have junkies in the film as it detracts from  the film's intended audience? Definately not for  pre-teens due to the substance abuse in the film (several times). The storyline  is basically a rehash of the classic E.T. but without  the emotional impact that E.T.had. You know the ending as it is very predictable all the way. In the finale you just  yawn and  say 'who cares' to yourself.Very disappointing.

review/summary: This Movie Doesn't Know What It Wants to Be
review/text: When the movie first started, I thought, "This is a great little movie." I loved the interaction with the kids, and think if Abrams could have kept the focus on that storyline (with the sci fi monster), it might have been a nice little flick ala "Stand By Me." Instead, it was a sappy, heavy-handed lecture on letting go and surviving through pain. It wasn't a big inspirational, the monster left a LOT to be desired. They could have easily chopped off 45 minutes in this movie and filled it with something else. The writing is poor, the special effects are stupid, and the story veers off in so many different directions it appears childish.<br /><br />One bright note was watching the "kids movie" at the very end. But don't bother watching the whole thing just to get there.

review/text: "Super 8" has lots of great parts to it: nerdy kids pursuing their passion, budding young love, government conspiracies, and a pretty cool monster, left just shadowy enough to engage the viewer's imagination. Given the potential of these ingredients, I'm not sure why it didn't do more for me.<br /><br />Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been. Maybe it was the triteness of anthropophagy - as if earthly proteins would do anything for a visitor from elsewhere. Maybe ... well it doesn't matter. I'm not asking for my money back, but I have no reason to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

It was laughable watching Spielberg remake this film in 1977 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (several versions; he strives for perfection, after all) and in 1982 as E.T., not to mention 1987 as *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. He continues to remake this British film. It is now vomitous. Are we not lucky to have "fresh" visions and "talented" filmmakers among us? Look up at the sky with a stupid expression if you disagree.

review/summary: The kids are annoying and worthless
review/text: One question - tell me what the alien looks like.  Seriously - what does it look like?  Draw a picture.  I can tell you what ET looks like.  I can tell you what Predator looks like.  I can tell you what the Alien from Aliens looks like.  Sooo... what the heck does this thing look like?<br /><br />You can't.  We never get a good enough look at it to figure it out.  For that reason alone this movie sucks.  Period.  End of story.  However, it sucks for many other reasons as well.<br /><br />What the heck is this movie anyway - some sort of mutant offspring of ET, Close Encounters, Cloverfield, and the Goonies?  Oh - except in the Goonies we actually had a group of kids that were likeable.  Not so here.  We get the chunky kid who is directing a Super 8 film - but he is rude, annoying, and entirely unlikeable.  We also have a thin crazy kid who likes fireworks.  He just comes off as a nut who is off his meds.  We also have a couple other young boys, none of which contribute anything to the film other than taking up space.<br /><br />That leaves us with the young male protagonist (I forgot his name) and the young female protagonist (I forgot her name) and their puppy love story - except that we don't get anything from that either.  At least in Goonies there was a kiss.<br /><br />This film follows the adventures of this worthless band of kids while an alien is loose somewhere in their town.  The dumb thing is that the kids really have no impact or relevance to anything that is happening.  What do they accomplish?  Do they help the alien?  No.  Do they hinder the alien?  No.  Do they do anything at all that impacts what the alien is doing?  No.  They have no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />What is the alien up to?  Well, that is hard to say exactly.  The alien digs himself (?) a cavern under the town's water tower and uses a bunch of local machinery to turn the tower into some sort of giant electro-magnet or something.  Apparently, the point of this exercise was to attract thousands of tiny "alien looking" cubes (about the size of Rubik's cubes).  You see - the alien ship was made out of a fancy alien alloy that converts into these little cubes.  One minute the ship has form, the next minute it becomes thousands of little cubes.  The how and why isn't important... just go with it.<br /><br />Ok - so I can live with that.  However, how the cubes are handled must be one of the dumbest moves in the history of alien containment programs.  When the government decides to move the alien cross country in a train, they put all the cubes into crates on the same train.  Why?<br /><br />Then, at the end of the film when the alien is using the magnetic water tower to collect metal and such, where are the cubes?  Parked in a series of trucks across the street!  Wow... it's like the most convenient plot twist in the history of film.  What is the range of the magnetic water tower?  Guess that doesn't matter because the government parked the cubes right across the street!  Lucky break for the alien because then the cubes all fly up into the air and re-create the alien ship - which then takes off like something from The Last Starfighter.<br /><br />To add to my list of gripes - what was the alien trying to accomplish anyway?  If the little cubes had not been parked right across the street from the water tower, what would have been the point?  Let's say that the government had actually done something intelligent and had these cubes in a secret base somewhere for research.  What then?  What was the tower going to accomplish then?  In fact, I'd argue that the only way the plot makes any sense at all is if the alien knew the cubes would be within the range of the tower in the first place.  Otherwise, what is the alien doing except wasting time?<br /><br />So the end result of this fiasco is that we have a bunch of kids that we don't care about chasing around an alien that we don't care about.  This is mixed in with some parents that we don't care about and some military leaders that we don't care about.  Super 8 only gets up to 2 stars because I didn't turn it off.  1 star is reserved for movies that are total garbage and unwatchable.

The train just swatted the truck aside (destroying it in the process) and continued on, with out derailing a single car. This crash was as though the train had hit an immovable wall, propelling huge freight cars through the air as though they were weightless, at least until they hit the ground.<br />Speilberg does love his CGI....but it doesn't make a movie.

review/text: A train derailment on the outskirts of a small Ohio town unleashes a mysterious creature.  Amid the resulting chaos, a small group of kids (Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Zach Mills) have their own little coming-of-age drama.<br /><br />For the first hour or so, I thought I was watching a 5-star film.  The kids, working on an amateur movie for a local film festival, are hilarious and touching.  Unfortunately, the quality of the film deteriorates as the conventions of the sci-fi action plot assert themselves.  The abilities of the creature are ill-defined; it just seems to be able to do whatever is convenient for the plot.  The naturalistic kids become unconvincing action movie heroes.  In this way, some of the best scenes are derailed even more spectacularly than the freight cars that kick off the whole thing.

review/summary: Missed the greater story for a losing scenario of science fiction
review/text: The title of the movie; Super 8, is truly misleading and could convey any thing but the confusion of the moviemaker in opting to a losing scenario. The movie started great, with coherent sequence of events that seemed to lead to a masterpiece of art. Soon, the train crash added great action and drama that was quickly dissipated by a slightly injured truck driver who should have been disseminated into unrecognizable parts in regard to the colossal train accident. That was then followed by another miscalculation on the part of the moviemaker of allowing all the kids who were in the center of the collision scene to survive. Some of those characters were irrelevant to the story and their survival did not serve any purpose but showing the unnecessary exaggeration.<br /><br />The movie would have still made it to glorious outcome despite the reckless exaggeration of surviving such upheaval. The underlying causes of the train accident would have made the best movie ever had the story stayed away from the frank display of an extraterrestrial monster. Losing confidence in the judgment of the moviemaker made the science fiction less comforting when the viewers should have been eased into believing in a fictional scenario rather than suspecting foul play on the part of the moviemaking.<br /><br />Many car engines disappeared, many missing dogs and equipments, those were still less unsettling than showing the monster closer to the end of the movie, building underground spaceship and harvesting all metal objects. Had the monster never been shown and left to the viewers to guess its features and motives, one could have remained pondering and enjoying the quizzing scenario to the end instead of feeling fooled by the irrational twisting of the events to served no logical cause.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: This was so bad! We walked out of it. It tries to capture that whole Spielburgesque feeling, you know, with kids on the bikes in a suburb looking for adventure, but fails completely. What plays out is extremely tedious. It's nothing more than a B monster movie with every character a boring stereotype.

review/summary: boring and offensive
review/text: Another movie where the government is the bad guy. The monster, which kills people and hangs them upside down, however, is just misunderstood. Plus, the plot is a badly disjointed patchwork of ideas stolen from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"  "E. T." , "Jaws" and Stephen King's "Tommyknockers.". Save your money.

review/summary: Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific communities
review/text: *** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />It sure doesn't hurt to have your film produced by Steven Spielberg and apparently J.J. Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.<br /><br />'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg--he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.<br /><br />The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives.<br /><br />After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).<br /><br />Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.<br /><br />While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.<br /><br />Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically--once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!<br /><br />For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.<br /><br />For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed.

review/text: The bad new: it's a dark version of the Goonies without most of the fun. The good news: my cousin got it from OnDemand. I didn't spend a dime on this movie, yay!<br /><br />Super 8 borrows from Aliens, the Goonies, ET, the directing style of Jaws or most older Spielberg movies, and the Blob.<br />It's not the worst movie but definitely not worth any of the hype and the preview was much better than most of the movie.<br /><br />I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.<br />For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.<br /><br />Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an "Extended", "Super", "Ultimate", "Collectors" version of whatever movie at some point.<br />I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your "Ultimate", "Platinum", "Gold", "Silver", "Special Anniversary" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even them I will buy one version of your movie and no more.<br /><br />Oh, and flixster.com sucks! If you give me a digital version of a movie, don't make visit a new site or make me register for a new service. I already have one and don't care about all of the other services.

review/summary: "AUTO-PILOTISH DIRECTION"
review/text: I knew I had to see this film when I saw the trailer. A trailer usually promises what can be deemed as a faithful description of the film. Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8. It's the kind of film you will never ever remember for anything, not even for the fat kid who thinks he should be a director. No irony and the direction seemed very auto-pilot'ish.

review/summary: How do you get past the original premise?
review/text: Have you ever witnessed (no, not seeing a video with little perspective) of a fast moving freight train hitting a vehicle?  I have long ago while working for the Union Pacific;  I was working for the U.P. and sitting trackside on a "ballast machine" knowing that the freight was about to come thru....thus making it requisite to pull into a siding which was there for such purposes.  A truck driver<br />with suicide on his mind pulled onto the tracks just as the freight was approaching.  Yes, there is debris flying through the air ahead of the impact area but any normal freight (75 to 100+ cars) will just slice right through the vehicle....there is no threat of a derailment under normal circumstances (such as an improperly maintained trackage) and will continue to pass through while the engineer attempts to stop the train.  It is a horrendous event to witness (the driver was killed immediately) but something with the tonnage of a freight train is not going to go flying in all directions.  J.J. Abrams has a wild imagination as shown in his earlier works....but the premise of a derailment is simply ridiculous.  And be prepared to describe the events before a Coroner's Jury!  Nothing more, nothing less.

review/summary: Super 8 - Disappointed
review/text: With heightened anticipation (Steven Spielberg is THE cinematic deity and Abrams...well Lost was quite original) based on a phenominal trailer I took my family to see Super 8. The movie seems to have been heavily influenced by ET and while it's not completely fair to make the connection, the movie would have been better served had it taken some lessons from the classic. I enjoyed the developing relationship between Joe and Alice who find a connection based on their difficult family circumstances and it was a pleasure watching these two young actors, as well as the other supporting character child roles. Unfortunately the movie fails miserably on three counts. One, the "bad guy", a military commander, is the same standard two-dimensional, typical cardboard cut out baddie that we've seen a gazillion times before. Two, the movie attempts to have the audience feel empathetic to a creature-character in the film, but fails to invest in any meaningful attachments that had to happen between it and the children. In fact, scenes were chosen that actually work against the emotional buildup that's required to appreciate the ending, instead you could really care less. I've seen ET nearly three dozen times in the last 25 years and it never fails to bring moisture to my eyes in the final moments of the film while your heart is breaking because of the character bond's established in the film - there is none of that here. Third, special effects and action scenes are fun to watch, (the train wreck scene is pretty cool, I'm not going to lie) but it would have been better to put more emphasis on story and character than on sequences that seemed pointless or were drawn out too long. Overall, I was marginally entertained, but felt let down given the pedigree of the talent behind the film - as if God was resting on the Sabbath day.

review/summary: Too Vague, Too Forced
review/text: What exactly is the plot anyway?  Some "thing".  Some "monster".  Is it an alien?  Dracula?  Bigfoot?  A kitten?<br /><br />The reviews here are mostly horrible too, which makes the title seem too forced.  Most of these reviews read like they were written by promoters for the movie itself.  Thanks, I'm sure you want me to think your product is great.  That's implicit in its mere existence.  But that does nothing to convince anyone.  It only adds to the lack of clarity and pointlessness by making it seem forced.<br /><br />"Umm, guys?  This title is a bomb, so let's talk it up so we at least make back our investment."<br /><br />"Haha, yeah!  Why actually make something decent when we can just force it down peoples' throats by artificially interfering with their purchase decisions?"<br /><br />Now to make thoughts like this seem stupid, half the reviews will be removed or rewritten, and a reply left to say, "I don't see what you're talking about, derp."  Maybe not, but I look at it this way: I could either look stupid by having that happen or look stupid by saying this and having it not happen.  But that doesn't mean I shouldn't speak up.  If you're going to hire shills to post fake reviews, then at least have them look into real ones.  NOBODY has only good things to say about ANYTHING.  It's human nature.  They need to identify the customers' reason to not buy, address that to make it appear to be of no concern, and then complain about some random, inconsequential thing.  Then follow up with a review that makes it sound great but complains about things people never complain about.  "The story ROCKED but that one dude's shirt had a coffee stain on it."<br /><br />Shill FAIL

review/text: For parents and kids like us who find it offensive, this film is loaded with swearing. It hardly ever lets up. My husband and I don't recall that 2 of the words were even in use in 1979. I didn't like that 3 of the 4 helpful adults in this movie used drugs or alcohol. The special effects are great. I think the story is weak and as a sci-fi fan I would have liked more of the "science" explained and more alien involvement other than simply throwing junk straight up in the air for most of the movie.  There is very little humor although one boy has perfect timing remarking on methods of suicide. (You would have to hear him, it's not as bad as it sounds.) All the kids did a pretty good job acting as their quirky characters. But if you find bad language offensive, I'd skip this one. Our son left the room halfway through. It was a Spielberg film and I wanted so much for it to get better, but I should have followed his example.

How they ever found such an inept bunch of pre-teen actors is beyond comprehension. The dialog between the cast was annoying at best. Not one of them could finish a line without interrupting each other making it a useless wall of noise (Directors fault). In short, this movie just doesn't accomplish its goal of making you feel something for the characters and the alien. In that case, I leave you with this...  What is the point then?

review/summary: I hate these kids
review/text: I don't enjoy writing serious reviews, and I'm not enjoying this so I suppose that would make sense.  In summary, don't watch this movie, and definitely don't pay money to own it forever, so it's sat on your shelf next to decent films like the Goonies and Gigli.  People judge you by the things you own (not me of course, I'm from an environmentally friendly pygmy tribe who spend our time helping others); don't allow them to hate you or think you are a stupid head because you have this movie on display.<br /><br />After a lifetime of character development and build up, you conclude that the kids are annoying and unlike-able, and the most annoying one (the fat bully) is so lame that they couldn't be bothered to write him out of the ending properly (cus he'd have ruined it even more).  What's worse is that they try to redeem him with a one-liner at the same time, and that's when you really (really) start to feel shafted.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, you can watch it yourself if you want that to happen; but even the Alien franchise hasn't stooped so patronisingly low by asking me to u-turn, and sympathise with the monster I'm supposed to fear.<br /><br />And now I can't stop thinking about how annoying the fat kid was. Damn these user reviews.

review/summary: A Classic Spielberg Sci-Fi Romp
review/text: This one has the Spielberg stamp all over it from beginning to end; if you liked E.T. you'll probably like this one too. I definitely fall into that camp and did in fact have a good time with this movie. It was fun to watch, interesting, fast paced and exciting to me.<br /><br />Although it didn't develop any really new sci-fi story ideas it did a good job of handling some tried and true sci-fi plot schemes and was in several ways similar to E.T. The acting and special effects were good and the kids did a very good job of carrying the movie. As sometimes happens in this kind of movie the military and the government are painted as villains and come across as not very nice.<br /><br />In summary the story holds one's attention and the acting effectively draws the viewer into the story so the movie goes by quickly. The special effects are rather spectacular so the overall package provides an action-filled movie that is entertaining.

review/summary: All the right ingredients, but not memorable
review/text: Great acting by all, particularly the kids. I liked the story line and the setting. The train crash was really well done. The extras kept me busy for another 2 hours. I particularly liked learning about the making of and the day in the life of a new kid actor. Overall it's a very good movie that I"ll probably watch again in a few years as I won't remember much about it.<br /><br />But, like others have said there are a lot of similarities to other movies, except for stand out moments like in ET or Stand By Me that I am going to remember. You can tell in the Extras that J.J. was shooting for that, but just doesn't quite get there. I started out confused in the beginning due mainly to the trailer showing a train crash that I thought someone died in the crash, but I wasn't sure who or why until much later. Other than the boy looking at his mother's necklace throughout I didn't see a lot of emotion about the loss. The girl showed much more emotion acting in their little super8 movie then he did and the scene at the end where the boy goes from being totally scared to being totally calm facing the monster down a leap in direction emotionally. Also what was with the dogs, were they just scared and running off. What was the monster doing with the people? The violence in which he took them and then the pristine health of the victims didn't seem to match, particularly if they had been drug through tunnels. I guess they wanted a scary movie that was politically correct or didn't scare little kids too much.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I am much older and I don't see the memorable moments with the same eyes that I saw ET or Stand By Me. I hope JJ keeps making more though as he's on the right track and hope to see the kids in more movies as they were naturals.

review/summary: May not be suitable for younger audiences
review/text: I expected this movie to be somewhere between the goonies and ET.  The rating is PG13.  At first I thought it has the potential to become a cult film, like the two mentioned. As the movie follows a group of teenagers, while making a film they watch a train derail and strange things start to happen.  The alien does not show up until the last part of the movie.  The alien fights and eats people.  While it is not a horror movie, the movie does show people getting crushed and blood splattering (warning for parents with younger kids) and this is the reason I am not sure about it becoming a cult movie.  Adults looking for a good alien movie will most likely be disappointed.  Again this is more like ET or Goonies with a darker twist and more blood, but not a bad movie.  Target audience are probably teenagers.

review/text: It's a movie that made me feel like Stephen King had a hand in it.  Great acting, all the kids were great and I think this one would be suitable for kids and adults.  It was full of action and had a few funny moments too.  The only bad thing I can say is that it was dark as in, just not a lot of light in this movie and sometimes it was hard to really tell what was going on.  Gave me that feel good feeling in the end...watch and you'll see what I mean.  Don't want to spoil it for you!

It was fun to watch just wish the movie had focused more on the kids' stories The end of the movie left some plot strings hanging in regards to the kids relationships.

review/summary: SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT I EXPECTED MORE
review/text: Set in the 70s and focused on a group of kids making a zombie movie who stumble upon something they weren't meant to know. The characters are nicely fleshed out and there's a definite sense of melancholy and even poignancy at times. In fact, I'd say the characters are the best part about this movie. The introduction of the alien and the ending resolution feels half baked, though. The end credits was done nicely. This film cost $50M to make and yielded close to $260M at the Box Office. A great deal of the advertising of this film early on was done through viral marketing.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; RESONANCE: B; CGI: B; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B

review/summary: Charming.
review/text: All of the elements that the one and two star reviews hate, I loved. I loved that the movie felt like a mashup of the goonies/sandlot vs. whatever monster movie. Yes, there was profanity, no it's not for children. It's like how Toy Story 3 was not a movie for kids, it was for the generation that grew up with Toy Story. I think this movie was charming and adorable despite the violence that ensued. How did he do that? I don't know, but it was cool!<br /><br /> What I loved about it was it had the charm of the Goonies/the Sandlot, but it was more grown up than that. Movies about friends getting through and somewhat a coming of age film. So what, a monster was thrown in? So what, the monster doesn't even make sense? I don't think the monster was even the point of the movie, but that's my personal opinion. I think people who get hung up on the monster have trouble with letting the movie take them out of reality. Yes, it felt like Cloverfield. But again, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE POINT. I was personally charmed by the child actors of this movie, I was charmed by the idea of the movie. Others have their opinions.

review/summary: You'll never want it to end...
review/text: This classic-to-be, by director J. J. Abrams and Producer Steven Spielberg, captures everything about the dreams of my youth.  I remember writing creative stories for my grade school class and illustrating them with crayon drawings.  I was hooked on Science Fiction like many young men of that era.  "Super 8" is a masterpiece...not only because it ventures where my thoughts and creative dreams wandered, but because it was perfectly cast, scripted and visualized by Spielberg and Abrams.  Without giving away one cent of the plot and outcome, this is a film that unfolds to new heights and you find yourself taking tiny doses of what ends up to be a mighty prescription for thrills, chills and heart-tugging (a trademark of Spielberg) emotions.  When it comes to an end, you'll want to watch it again.  When it begins, you never really want it to end.  Don't miss this gem.

review/summary: Now this is how fun movies should be!
review/text: Wow. This was ET/Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind/Cloverfield/The Goonies all rolled into one with some Stand by Me thrown in as well - and it was a roller coaster ride of fun, excitement, drama, family, friendship, love, redemption and forgiveness.<br /><br />The humor was excellent, especially between the kids. The humor was spot on, even during the more tense<br />scenes and how the kids pulled together, helped each other out, even when they had their differences. This reminded me so much of how I was with my friends when I was their age.<br /><br />Abrams' script and pacing with this film has made this a movie to enjoy over and over again. For an Abrams film,<br />it's quite different from how Star Trek (another excellent film) was, but that should not deter you from watching<br />this movie. Even the drug use by one of the characters is put to good use in a humorous way on how the use<br />of drugs can be dangerous. It made me laugh but it was a message to kids: DON'T USE DRUGS!<br /><br />This was how Spielburg used to make his movies and JJ Abrams hit the nail on the head with this one. As<br />others have said, don't wait to see this movie. It is a must see! I can't wait to watch this movie again. It's that much fun!<br /><br />Oh, and sit through the end credits to watch the zombie movie with a tip of the hat to George Romero. Watch<br />especially as the kids "act" their way through the movie - it's just like kids would act. I remember when I was<br />their age doing a movie my friend was directing. It fits and it looks exactly like how kids would do it, even with<br />the cheesy visual and sound effects. Hilarious and so realistic!

review/summary: Super 8 brings back magical moviemaking
review/text: Super 8 has received some criticism for being an homage to those kid-friendly adventure movies of the 80's (E.T. and Goonies), but that's why it's fun and charming! If you grew up watching those great films, then you may enjoy the nostalgia as you watch a group of boys hang out, cuss, fight and then compete for the same girl. If you didn't, you'll like the movie for it's interesting characters and plot. True, there are countless monster movies out there. But, there's something about this one that makes you wonder what that thing in the train really is! What's it doing? Believe it or not, the creature has some motivation that does not involve eating earthlings or burying some ungodly nest. And what's its connection to the shy boy Joe Lamb? Joe has been compared to Elliot from E.T., but Joe isn't interested in making friends (although he would like to send the thing home). All he wants is his dad's attention, and the girl. The creature presents an interesting opportunity to get both.<br /><br />Super 8 is a refreshing movie in a time when every character from every other movie has cell phones or the Internet to help solve mysteries. These kids are faced with jumping into dark caves all by themselves without any help or any clue as to what they're dealing with. Buy it! It's worth it!

review/summary: I Didn't H8 It, But It Wasn't Gr8
review/text: On the one hand, I'm not a big fan of monster movies that keep the monster mostly out of sight or hard to see throughout the movie. But knowing that was the formula that JJ Abrams used for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a>, my expectations were set for that...and my expectations where met. At least the Cloverfield hand held camera part of the formula was dropped for Super 8.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm a big fan of a well written and well acted story. While Super 8 was full of moments that were simply not believable, the story flow and the amusing but accurate capture of how a group of middle schoolers interact with each other saved Super 8 from 2 star land.<br /><br />My kids loved Super 8. Although I'd hesitate to call it a great 'family' film simply based on some of the mature material and language. It's actually refreshing to see the MPAA take a more lax approach to language with a PG-13 instead of an R. I suppose having Steven Spielberg on board as producer may have had some pull.<br /><br />Basically a bunch of kids in a remote town are witness to a military train crash. Unfortunately one of the passengers on the train really wants to go home but that's not where the train was taking him...er...I mean...It. But when the train crashes this 'dark' passenger has a chance to escape and the kids do a better job of tracking down the escaped passenger than the most qualified government agency ever could. Now there's a formula that never seems to get old in Hollywood, right?...Smart civilians and kids outwit the dumb old police and military. Oy.<br /><br />So overall I was entertained by Super 8, but I walked away feeling like it was a kid's movie in PG-13 clothing.

My opinion was that this is great fun; sure it has a couple of unexplained issues, but perhaps they are supposed to be that way (boring if EVERYTHING is explained).<br />Its a sci fi adventure film on a grand scale and definitely on my "Must buy on Blu-Ray" list :)

review/text: I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie considering I watched it on a whim. It felt like a fun 80's throwback, somehow reminding me of the Goonies- one of my favourite childhood movies. It had that same sense of youthful adventure and escapism, admittedly with a somewhat darker tone. The cinematography was simply beautiful and the acting extraordinary, especially on the part of Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, who gave very nuanced performances. I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

review/text: At first it reminded me of the Goonies but it was different. I thought about "IT" but it wasn't that either. The bottom line is that it was it's own movie and a pretty good one. While it didn't have the most original plot line it did have a few new wrinkles and it did make you care about the characters, that's important. No really big name actors but they all did a good job. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Elle Fanning, She was terrific! I won't go into all the details, you can read that in the other reviews. And actually I think the best part is I can watch it with my grand kids. :) Well, the older anyhow it is PG 13.

review/summary: Reminiscent of ET - Finally, Good Sci Fi
review/text: I have watched probably 30 movies in the past month or so, and this is the first one that has made me want to review it. There is so much junk these days, so many bad stories, repetitious stories, so much bad acting (mostly bad directing), coming of age movies, or deadly B-rated shark attack movies (the new and "improved" syfy channel batters us with some of the worst movies, my husband and I watch them because it's actually entertaining making fun of them), paranormal movies that not only do not scare me, but make me cringe they are so terrible (why does the woman ALWAYS scream????), movies where the theme is about dying, but the character either meets the love of their lives or becomes some sort of hero, movies about today's new and improved families (usually pushing one or several of today's interpretation of family and how wonderful they are - I call them preachy movies), lame love stories that usually make me wish I had those 90 minutes of my life back at the end, or so-called comedies, filled with so many bathroom references, it just stops being funny. I've recently been complaining that there aren't enough of the wonderful big movies like Gladiator, Terminator, Independence Day, Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, or any Alien movie or Underworld type movies these days. Batman, Spiderman or any of the comics superheroes seem to be the only ones being produced. (Exception being the Hunger Games movies which are exceptional!)<br /><br />Today, as I was perusing my sad selection of Netflix movies, I noticed this one (Super 8) made by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielburg. I read the blurb about six kids making a movie and catching something supernatural with their Super 8 camera. There are two genres - there is supernatural, and there is sci fi. Sometimes the two intertwine, but honestly, this one fits neatly into the sci fi genre. SPOILER ALERT: you might not actually know that until about 3/4 of the way through the movie, however. So, I almost passed it up, having had my fill of the many, many supernatural movies available these days (most of them pretty bad). But JJ Abrams? I took a chance because for the most part, he is one of today's brightest stars in sci fi genre TV shows and movies.<br /><br />WOW! Maybe because my expectations were so low, I actually loved this movie. It's been a while since I have loved watching a movie like this one. The story centers around six middle school age kids, Joe, Cary, Preston, Charles, Martin and Alice, who want to enter a contest with their movie. They borrow Charles' parents' Super 8 movie camera, as the movie is shot in 1979, just before the DVD movie cameras burst onto the scene. The interaction between these six kids is simply amazing to watch. Instead of being snotty, or over-the-top nerdy, they are played as real kids who, before the age of Nintendo and computer games, still have to amuse themselves with either sports or in this case, the arts. Watching these six together, as they meet after dark at an old-looking train station on the edge of their all-American town, I was drawn in as they set up their scene between Martin and a reluctant Alice. Martin is all geeked out in a suit and old-fashioned looking hat, and Alice just stands there in jeans and a t-shirt waiting to begin. Looking back, somehow, I have to imagine a very young Abrams maybe taking a scene out of his own childhood. These kids are really ready - they have scripts, and they know the on-set jargon, they have a make-up kit, and a nice looking tripod for the camera, we even find out that Charles, as director, has a good set of ear phones. This first scene is practice - and as Martin begins his lines, we watch the absolutely wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice come to life playing a young woman trying to convince her husband (or boyfriend) to stay with her and not leave. It was almost literally the opening of the movie and I was already completely pulled into the story.<br /><br />As they set up for the first "take" of the movie and begin filming, Charles sees a real train coming down the track and yells "PRODUCTION VALUE," for the first of several times as he sees (and I'm thinking now, DEFINITELY a blast from Abram's past) a chance for some real cool background (the scene set to the train screaming by). They quickly get all set up and start filming the scene for real. The actual star of the movie (Super 8) is Joe, played very well by a relative newcomer named Joel Courtney (a young actor to watch). As the other five kids are involved in the filming, Joe looks backward for a moment down the track and watches as a truck rolls onto the track and aims straight for the train. He alerts the other five and they watch in horror as the inevitable collision draws near.<br /><br />The ensuing crash was a bit over-the-top spectacular (seriously, I doubt a smallish old truck like that could create the mayhem that followed), but I'm already hooked and loving this moving so I suspend my critical eye right now and watch the spectacle with heart-stopping excitement. Every car on this longish train smashes up in the air, over the little train station, spilling tons of explosions and debris everywhere. We lose Alice as the boys scramble for safety, but in the end, (again suspending reality a bit) all six kids are OK. What they don't realize, but we are privy to see is that the camera rolled, on its side, throughout most of the collision and fireworks. As the kids regroup, slapping each other on the back at not only seeing the spectacle, but living through it, the nefarious military vehicles roll up, causing them to grab their stuff and run.<br /><br />At this point, I'm in! The rest of the movie is a wonderful mix of great action and moments of sweet contemplation, these kids really deserve high praise for their performances (or probably JJ Abrams can get a great performance out of an orange, not sure, and yes, I am a huge fan of his). The story continues to be strong as the secrets are discovered by the children, and eventually the fathers of Joe and Alice (the always wonderful Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard both of whom are among two of today's best but seriously under appreciated actors) who both end up helping them, thus removing the normal - parents are bad, kids know everything theme I see so much these days. I read a review where someone criticized too many longing looks and too much boring dialogue, but I say, if you play too many games or watch too many violent movies, you probably won't like the sweet moments between Joe and Alice, obviously both harboring crushes on each other, or Charles and Joe (as they are watching the movie it took two days to get developed, the scenes taken when the camera was on its side and continued to capture the train wreck), as they quibble over both of them liking Alice.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: The end is a bit of a twist, although if you read my caption above, you might have an idea about what happens, but I loved it. I have to add here that the bad language used by the children was a bit unnecessary here and there, and I am a full-out supporter of the military and I'm afraid this movie plays into the X-Files (which I love) military is bad conspiracies and I admit to wishing it could have been an evil corporation as the protagonist instead of our heroes who a lot of people have no idea how much they give up and how hard they work to keep us safe and free (and I admit to being retired military), but I am not one to throw out the baby with the bath water. Despite these fairly minor annoyances of mine, I still gave it five stars. And trust me, had it been anything less than excellent in every way, I would downgrade it one star for the tired old evil military so many Hollywood producers cast as the bad guys these days. JJ, do me a favor, do our military a favor, too? Make one like this again - but make a pharmaceutical company the bad guy. They actually kind of deserve it. JMHO.<br /><br />Despite that, I am just so happy to finally be able to recommend a good sci fi movie to my friends! It's been a long, dry period for those of us who love the genre. If you want a really good movie with some great scary parts, big explosions, sweetness of youth, and parents who love, a very winning mix, and no preaching at you or watching sad death scenes or constant dumb bathroom talk, watch this movie. Super 8 is the best movie I've seen in a long time.

review/summary: A kid, a dad, an alien: Transforming the ravages of fear, anger and loss
review/text: "Super 8" is a well done film. The narrative is smooth and generally makes sense. The visuals are impressive with the film within a film device working particularly well. The acting is believable from start to finish. The "creature" turns out to be "someone" who is far from home and has been frightened into madness.<br /><br />At the heart of story is a boy who has lost his mother in a terrible work accident, a father who has lost his wife and, as a result, his son, and is trying to replace both with his job, and an alien imprisoned for many years by a combination of curious scientists, and nasty government types.<br /><br />The three are thrown together by a train crash and the film is mostly about them moving toward each other.<br /><br />At one point the boy yells at his father that "he does not get it." At the end of the film, the dad holds his son in his arms and says "I got you." A few moments earlier the alien, having grabbed the kid, and discovering that he has touched a kindred soul- lost, sad, in pain, angry- hears the words: "You don't have to stay." after the boy's statement that sometimes awful things happen and you just have to move on.<br /><br />The boy gets it.<br />The dad gets it.<br />The alien gets it.<br />I got it.<br /><br />It's a powerful message.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good Movie
review/text: I'm not a big fan of movies with kids as the main characters, but this one was pretty good.  Their interactions with each other, the adults, and their situation all seem realistic.  Although you don't really get a clear view of the creature involved, you don't really need to in order to feel the tension in this movie.  It's not the best "creature"-based movie I've seen, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>] has that distinction) but it was a pretty good one.

review/summary: Old-school sci-fi
review/text: A factory accident in the small town of Lillian, Ohio leaves an emotionally distant man (Kyle Chandler) a widower and his son without the one parent he could relate to. At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.<br /><br />  One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train.<br /><br />  Written and directed by J. J. Abrams of Lost fame and with Steven Spielberg co-producing, Super 8 is easily a step above efforts like Cloverfield and Artificial Intelligence while falling just short of films like E.T., Super 8 is a welcomed addition to the sci-fi genre and a great time to be had at the movies.

review/summary: excellent, one of the years best
review/text: the first 75 minutes was a tour de force, excellent film-making!  the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.<br /><br />yes, it's a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters.  still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt.  the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way.  born in the 70s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome (i can remember when i painted action/fantasy figures too/model trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!)<br /><br />thumbs up !!

review/text: I saw this movie at the theater with my kids and the entire audience loved it! My only caution would be to consider that they originally planned to film it in 3D. Without the 3D visuals of any serious movie today, it lacked something (my family agrees). Still, it's a fun movie I would highly recommend.

review/text: I saw the film in a theater too. It was a lovely story, although there were some awful scenes. I think it will give lots of dreams to children and let them think about the importance of our world, the Earth. The ending was so nice. As I liked it so much, I even visited almost all the locations in Weirton after I had seen it in a theater. It is not a big problem, but there is one thing I don't know the reason. Why is this film sold with a bluray and dvd combo?

review/text: I really enjoyed this movie and doubt I have anything to add that other positive reviews haven't already touched on.  However, as someone who always reads credits straight through to the end I was pleased to see that the images of the runaway dogs seen on the bulletin board where Joe posts a picture of his own dog Lucy came from animal shelters.  Thanks to exposure from being in the film, if only for a moment, the dogs have all been adopted.  I can see the description now:  "Lovable lab looking for forever home.  Was seen in the blockbuster Abrams/Spielberg film 'Super 8'!"  This movie gave new lives to some homeless animals and that is a wonderful thing.

review/text: So sorry I missed this in the theater, but at least I have a 42" TV to enjoy it now. This is a superb movie with some good young actors & a satisfying story. It's a monster movie, a family movie, a movie about friends, and a movie about growing up and moving beyond.<br /><br />This could easily join my overly-crowded pantheon of top ten movies.

review/summary: Super 8
review/text: J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film. When strange things begin occurring in town, the children take it upon themselves to solve the mystery. Super 8 is an earnest throwback to the kid-friendly sci-fi adventures of the 1980s, and with Steven Spielberg producing, it's no wonder. With plenty of thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth, Super 8 a pretty good choice if you're looking for some good, old-fashioned, nostalgic fun.

review/summary: A good Sci-Fi movie
review/text: My family saw this movie at the theater and we just watched the DVD.  We enjoyed it both times.  My wife loves movies with child actors in it and said that this reminded her of "Stand by Me."  I thought the kids did a good job of acting and the story line was pretty good.  The special effects were also good and Spielberg always makes a great movie.<br /><br />It was creative and interesting to watch but I did not give it 5 starts because the alien wasn't really seen until the end and only for a short period of time.  In the old movies they did this and kept the screen dark because the special effects were so bad. I always hated that! Today that is not necessary as special effects look so real and I think the movie would have been better with more scenes with the alien being shown.<br /><br />Overall it is a solid rank of 4 but it could have been a 5 with some script changes and more alien sightings.

review/text: ... only not as good as The Goonies. The cast of kids were all really cute and talented actors. The visuals were amazing. The plot kept me entertained. The only thing that got on my nerves was that the father's accent would come and go. I don't know why they tried to force him to drop what must be a prominent Southern accent. It would have made no difference to the movie and been much less distracting.
